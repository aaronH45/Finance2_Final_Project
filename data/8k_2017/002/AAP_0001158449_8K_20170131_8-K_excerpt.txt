(the “Company”), Advance Stores, as Borrower, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed December 9, 2013.

Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

Entry into Credit Agreement

On January 31, 2017, the Company, as Guarantor, entered into a new credit agreement which provides a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2017 Credit Agreement”) with Advance Stores, as Borrower, the lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., Administrative Agent (the "Agent"). This new revolver under the 2017 Credit Agreement replaced the revolver under the 2013 Credit Agreement (terminated as described in Item 1.02 above). The new revolver provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit of $200 million. The Company may request that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not exceeding $250 million during the term of the 2017 Credit Agreement. Voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving loan balance, if any, are permitted in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, in minimum principal amounts as specified in the 2017 Credit Agreement.

The interest rates on outstanding amounts, if any, on the revolving facility under the 2017 Credit Agreement will be based, at the Company’s option, on an adjusted LIBOR, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. After an initial interest period, the Company may elect to convert a particular borrowing to a different type. The initial margins per annum for the revolving loan are, 1.10% for the adjusted LIBOR and 0.10% for alternate base rate borrowings. A facility fee of 0.15% per annum will be charged on the total revolving facility commitment, payable quarterly in arrears. Under the terms of the 2017 Credit Agreement, the interest rate spread, facility fee and commitment fee will be based on the Company’s credit rating. The revolving facility terminates in January 2022; however, the Company may request one or two one-year extensions of the termination date prior to the first or second anniversary of the Closing Date.

The 2017 Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Company and the Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement (the “Guarantee Agreement”) among the Company, Advance Stores, and the Guarantors in favor of the Agent for the lenders under the 2017 Credit Agreement.

The 2017 Credit Agreement contains customary covenants restricting the ability of: (a) Advance Stores and its subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) create, incur or assume additional debt (only with respect to subsidiaries of Advance Stores), (ii) incur liens, (iii) guarantee obligations, and (iv) change the nature of its business conducted by itself and its subsidiaries; (b) the Company, Advance Stores and their subsidiaries to, among other things (i) enter into certain hedging arrangements, (ii) enter into restrictive agreements limiting their ability to incur liens on any of their property or assets, pay distributions, repay loans, or guarantee indebtedness of their subsidiaries; and (c) the Company, among other things, to change the holding company status of the Company. Advance Stores is required to comply with financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum coverage ratio. The 2017 Credit Agreement also provides for customary events of default, including non-payment defaults, covenant defaults and cross-defaults of Advance Stores’ other material indebtedness.

The above description of the 2017 Credit Agreement and the related Guarantee Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the respective agreements, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
