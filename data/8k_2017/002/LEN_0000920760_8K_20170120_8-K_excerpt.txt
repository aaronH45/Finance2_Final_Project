Item 8.01 Other Events.  

On January 20, 2017, Lennar Corporation (the “Company”) completed the sale of $600 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.125% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “Notes”). The offer and sale of the Notes had been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $595.0 million from the sale of the Notes after deducting the underwriters’ fees and certain expenses of the offering. The Notes are governed by an Indenture, dated as of December 31, 1997 (the “Indenture”), as supplemented by a Thirteenth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 20, 2017, by and among the Company, a number of its subsidiaries as guarantors and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 4.125% per annum from January 20, 2017, and will be payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing July 15, 2017. The Notes will mature on January 15, 2022, subject to earlier redemption or repurchase. The Notes are guaranteed by most, but not all, of the Company’s subsidiaries, but the guarantee by particular subsidiaries may be suspended or terminated under some circumstances.  

The above description of the Notes and the Thirteenth Supplemental Indenture is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Thirteenth Supplemental Indenture (including the form of Note included therein), a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.17 hereto.
