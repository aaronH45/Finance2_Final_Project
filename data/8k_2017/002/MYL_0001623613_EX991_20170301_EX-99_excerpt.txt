Full Year 2016 Financial Highlights[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Mylan CEO Heather Bresch commented, "Our strong 2016 results were highlighted by year-over-year constant-currency total revenue growth of 18% and adjusted EPS growth of 14%. The fourth quarter capped off the year with impressive revenue growth of 31% and adjusted EPS growth of 29%. Again, we saw all of our regions contribute to our results for the year, with double-digit revenue increases in North America, Europe and Rest of World, reflecting the resilience, differentiation and diversity of our global platform and our unwavering focus on execution. The diversity of our business was further demonstrated by our six global therapeutic franchises that delivered approximately $1 billion or more in revenue: Respiratory and Allergy, CNS and Anesthesia, Infectious Disease, Cardiovascular, Gastrointestinal, and Diabetes and Metabolism.

“We look forward in 2017 to delivering yet another strong year of performance, with anticipated 2017 revenues of $12.25 billion to $13.75 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.15 to $5.55. We also continue to advance toward our long-stated 2018 adjusted EPS target of $6.00.”

Mylan President Rajiv Malik said, “In addition to executing on our core business, we completed during the year our acquisitions of Meda and the non-sterile, topicals-focused business of Renaissance Acquisition Holdings, which further built our scale and breadth from a product and geographic perspective. We continued the successful integration of Mylan, bringing these transactions into our One Mylan platform. Further, we continued executing on the many drivers of our organic growth, as evidenced, for instance, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s acceptance of our abbreviated new drug application for Generic Advair Diskus® and our submissions for biosimilars Pegfilgrastim and Trastuzumab. With regard to the pricing environment, we continued to see erosion both globally and in U.S. generics in the mid-single digits which was in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect a comparable environment in 2017 given the breadth and make-up of our global portfolio.”

Mylan CFO Ken Parks added, “In 2016, Mylan once again benefited from the depth and breadth of our portfolio which drove significant cash flow generation. Our adjusted free cash flow increased by more than 15% to $2.1 billion. We are positioned well to reduce debt levels, while also allowing for financial flexibility for future growth opportunities and maintaining our commitment to our investment grade credit rating.”

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(2)  As a result of our acquisition of Meda on August 5, 2016 and the integration of our portfolio across our branded, generics and over-the-counter platforms in all of our regions, effective October 1, 2016, we expanded our reportable segments as follows: North America, Europe and Rest of World. As a result, the amounts previously reported under the Specialty segment have been recast to North America and amounts related to Brazil are included in Rest of World for all periods presented. Segment amounts represent third party net sales.

Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Results

Total Revenues

Total revenues were $3.27 billion in 2016, compared to $2.49 billion in the prior year period. Third party net sales for the current quarter were $3.22 billion compared to $2.47 billion for the prior year period, representing an increase of $746.8 million, or 30%. Other third party revenues for the current quarter were $46.2 million compared to $15.9 million in the prior year period, an increase of $30.3 million as a result of an increase in royalty income, including the impact of current year acquisitions. Below is a summary of third party net sales in each of our segments for the three months ended December 31, 2016:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total Gross Profit

Gross profit was $1.34 billion and $1.06 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross margins were 41% and 43% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross margins were negatively impacted in the current quarter due to increased amortization of intangible assets, the amortization of acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustments and intangible asset impairment charges. This negative impact was partially offset by the positive impact of net sales from new products. Adjusted gross profit was $1.85 billion and adjusted gross margins were 57% for the quarter compared to adjusted gross profit of $1.40 billion and adjusted gross margins of 56% in the prior year period. Adjusted gross margins were positively impacted in the current quarter as a result of net sales from new products and the net impact of acquisitions. 

2

Total Profitability

Earnings from operations decreased $108.1 million from the comparable prior year period primarily due to the Modafinil antitrust litigation settlement of $165 million, higher amortization expense and operating expenses related to recent acquisitions.

R&D expense increased from the comparable prior year period due to the inclusion of Meda and the Topicals Business, expenses incurred related to the Company's collaboration with Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Momenta”) and the continued development of our respiratory, insulin and biologics programs. SG&A expense increased from the comparable prior year period primarily due to the additional expense related to the acquisitions of Meda and the Topicals Business as well as restructuring charges incurred in the current quarter.

U.S. GAAP net earnings attributable to Mylan N.V. ordinary shareholders ("U.S. GAAP net earnings") increased by $222.9 million to $417.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, compared to $194.6 million for the prior year period. Fourth quarter 2016 U.S. GAAP net earnings were negatively impacted by the reduction of earnings from operations and increased non-operating expenses including higher interest expense. Partially offsetting these decreases were fair value gains recorded on certain acquisition related contingent consideration and the recognition of an income tax benefit of $192.6 million in the fourth quarter primarily due to the mix of earnings between our U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries. U.S. GAAP EPS increased from $0.38 to $0.78 in the current quarter. Adjusted net earnings increased by $222.0 million to $842.2 million compared to $620.2 million for the prior year period. Adjusted EPS increased 29% to $1.57 compared to $1.22 in the prior year period.

EBITDA, which is defined as net earnings (excluding the non-controlling interest and losses from equity method investees) plus income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, was $878.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, and $657.5 million for the comparable prior year quarter. After adjusting for certain items as further detailed in the reconciliation below, adjusted EBITDA was $1.21 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and $827.2 million for the comparable prior year quarter.

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Financial Results

Total Revenues

Total revenues were $11.08 billion in 2016, compared to $9.43 billion in the prior year. Third party net sales for the current year were $10.97 billion compared to $9.36 billion for the prior year, representing an increase of $1.60 billion, or 17%. Other third party revenues for the current year were $109.8 million compared to $66.7 million in the prior year, an increase of $43.1 million which is consistent with the fourth quarter increase. Below is a summary of third party net sales in each of our segments for the year ended December 31, 2016:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

higher sales volumes in Japan, India, Australia and emerging markets positively contributed to the sales growth in this segment. These increases were partially offset by lower pricing throughout the segment, including the ARV franchise. However, sales within our ARV franchise increased progressively throughout 2016. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation on third party net sales was approximately $21 million, or 1%. 

Total Gross Profit

Gross profit was $4.70 billion and $4.22 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross margins were 42% and 45% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross margins were negatively impacted in the current year due to increased amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting related items consistent with the fourth quarter. This negative impact was partially offset by the positive impact of net sales from new products. Adjusted gross profit was $6.21 billion and $5.25 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Adjusted gross margins were 56% in both 2016 and 2015. Adjusted gross margins were positively impacted in the current year as a result of net sales from new products and the net impact of acquisitions. 

Total Profitability

Earnings from operations were $701.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 52% from the comparable prior year. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in litigation settlements, higher amortization expense and operating expenses related to acquisitions completed during 2016.

R&D expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased from the comparable prior year consistent with the fourth quarter drivers.

SG&A expense increased from the comparable prior year period principally due to the additional expense related to the acquisition of Meda and the additional two months of expense from the EPD Business. In addition, we incurred approximately $113.1 million of restructuring charges which were offset by lower acquisition related costs in the current year, including consulting and legal costs.

U.S. GAAP net earnings decreased by $367.6 million to $480.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $847.6 million for the prior year. U.S. GAAP EPS decreased from $1.70 to $0.92 as a result of the reduction of earnings from operations and higher non-operating expenses including higher interest expense as a result of recent acquisition related borrowings and a higher average share count. Partially offsetting these items was the recognition of an income tax benefit of $358.3 million in the current year. Adjusted net earnings increased by $409.9 million to $2.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2.14 billion for the prior year period. Adjusted EPS increased 14% to $4.89 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $4.30 in the prior year period.

EBITDA was $2.21 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $2.39 billion for the comparable prior year period. After adjusting for certain items as further detailed in the reconciliation below, adjusted EBITDA was $3.68 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $3.01 billion for the comparable prior year period.

Cash Flow 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.05 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2.01 billion for the prior year. Capital expenditures were approximately $390.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to approximately $362.9 million for the comparable prior year. Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was $2.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $2.22 billion for the prior year. Adjusted free cash flow, defined as adjusted cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was $2.13 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.85 billion in the prior year.

Guidance

Mylan expects 2017 total revenues in the range of $12.25 billion to $13.75 billion, the midpoint of which represents an increase of 17% versus 2016. As discussed in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section below, Mylan is not otherwise providing forward looking guidance for U.S. GAAP reported financial measures or a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.55, the midpoint of which represents an increase of 9% versus 2016.

The following table provides a summary of Mylan's 2017 full year guidance ranges, along with significant exchange rates used in preparing the guidance.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This press release includes the presentation and discussion of certain financial information that differs from what is reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, adjusted EPS, adjusted total revenues, adjusted third party net sales from Europe, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margins, adjusted net earnings, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash provided by operating activities, adjusted free cash flow, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of adjusted total revenues, adjusted R&D as a percentage of adjusted total revenues and adjusted effective tax rate are presented in order to supplement investors' and other readers' understanding and assessment of the financial performance of Mylan N.V. ("Mylan" or the "Company"). Management uses these measures internally for forecasting, budgeting, measuring its operating performance, and incentive-based awards. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental information for our investors and when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations. The financial performance of the Company is measured by senior management, in part, using the adjusted metrics included herein, along with other performance metrics. Management’s annual incentive compensation is derived, in part, based on the adjusted EPS metric. In addition, primarily due to acquisitions, Mylan believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the Company believes that including EBITDA and supplemental adjustments applied in presenting adjusted EBITDA pursuant to our debt agreements is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate the Company's ability to comply with financial debt covenants (which are calculated using a measure similar to adjusted EBITDA) and assess the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness. We also report sales performance using the non-GAAP financial measure of "constant currency" total revenues and third party net sales. This measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current period. The comparisons presented as constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. We routinely evaluate our third party net sales performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating a period-to-period comparison of our operational activities, and we believe that this presentation also provides useful information to investors for the same reason. The "Summary of Total Revenues by Segment" table below compares third party net sales on an actual and constant currency basis for each reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Also, other than as described, set forth below, Mylan has provided reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures set forth below, and investors and other readers should consider non-GAAP measures only as supplements to, not as substitutes for or as superior measures to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

For additional information regarding the components and uses of Non-GAAP financial measures refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-- Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of Mylan’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. 

Mylan is not providing forward looking guidance for U.S. GAAP reported financial measures or a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable effort. These items include, but are not limited to, acquisition-related expenses including those related to the Meda transaction, restructuring expenses, asset impairments, litigation settlements and other contingencies, including changes to contingent consideration and certain other gains or losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the guidance period. With respect to the target of $6.00 in adjusted EPS in 2018, it does not represent Company guidance and the Company is not providing a U.S. GAAP target or reconciliation because the Company has not quantified all future amounts, including U.S. GAAP amounts, related to this target.

Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EPS
