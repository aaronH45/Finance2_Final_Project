Eversource Energy Reports Full Year 2016 Results 

(HARTFORD, Conn. and BOSTON, Mass. – February 21, 2017) Eversource Energy (NYSE: ES) today reported full-year 2016 earnings of $942.3 million, or $2.96 per share, compared with 2015 earnings of $878.5 million, or $2.76 per share.  

In the fourth quarter of 2016, Eversource Energy earned $229.2 million, or $0.72 per share, compared with earnings of $181.8 million, or $0.57 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2015.  

“2016 was a year of continued strong earnings and dividend growth and the emergence of new opportunities for us to be the catalyst for clean energy development in New England,” said Jim Judge, Eversource Energy president and chief executive officer. “We envision 2017 to be a year during which many opportunities to enhance service and clean energy options for our customers advance, from bringing clean hydroelectric power into the region to enabling solar, energy storage, natural gas expansion, and off-shore wind development.” 

2017 and Long-Term Earnings Per Share (EPS) Guidance 

Also today, Eversource Energy projected 2017 earnings of between $3.05 per share and $3.20 per share and long-term earnings per share growth through 2020 of between 5 percent and 7 percent, using 2016 earnings of $2.96 per share as the base.  

Electric Transmission 

Eversource Energy’s transmission segment earned $370.8 million for the full year of 2016, compared with earnings of $304.5 million for the full year of 2015. The transmission segment earned $104.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with earnings of $79.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Higher full-year earnings were due primarily to an increased level of investment in Eversource Energy transmission facilities and the absence in 2016 of a charge recorded in 2015 related to reviews by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) of the authorized return on equity (ROE) for the owners of New England’s electric transmission system. Results in 2016 also benefited from a settlement related to the recovery of $27.5 million of pre-tax merger-related costs through electric transmission rates over one year beginning June 1, 2016. FERC approved the settlement on January 31, 2017. 

Electric Distribution and Generation 

Eversource Energy’s electric distribution and generation segment earned $462.8 million for the full year of 2016, compared with $507.1 million for the full year of 2015. The benefits of higher revenues were more than offset by the absence in 2016 of the benefits from certain positive regulatory items affecting NSTAR Electric in 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the electric distribution and generation segment earned $81.5 million, compared with earnings of $88.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The fourth quarter decline was also due in part to the absence in 2016 of positive regulatory items recorded in 2015. 

Natural Gas Distribution 

Eversource Energy’s natural gas distribution segment earned $77.7 million for the full year of 2016, compared with earnings of $72.4 million for the full year of 2015. Fourth quarter natural gas segment earnings were $25.8 million in 2016, compared with $14.9 million in 2015. Improved fourth quarter results in 2016 were driven primarily by colder, more seasonable temperatures in 2016, compared with the record warm weather of December 2015. Firm natural gas sales rose 22 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with the same period of 2015. 

Eversource Energy parent and other companies 

Eversource Energy parent and other companies earned $31 million for the full year of 2016, compared with a net loss of $5.5 million for the full year of 2015. Improved results were driven largely by lower costs related to integration and a lower effective tax rate.

1 All per-share amounts in this news release are reported on a diluted basis. The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Eversource Energy. The earnings and EPS of each business do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such business, but rather represent a direct  

interest in Eversource Energy's assets and liabilities, as a whole. EPS by business is a non-GAAP (not determined using generally accepted accounting principles) measure that is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to controlling interests of each business by the weighted average diluted Eversource parent common shares outstanding for the period. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate earnings results, provide details of earnings results by business, and more fully compare and explain our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 and 2015 results. Management believes that this measurement is useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of Eversource Energy’s businesses. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to Eversource Energy’s consolidated net income attributable to controlling interests or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of Eversource Energy’s operating performance.
