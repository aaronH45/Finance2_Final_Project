 Item 8.01 Other Events  

On January 27, 2017, Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (the “Company”) acquired certain assets including the brand, website and certain IP assets and assumed certain contractual obligations of Chef Central, a retailer of kitchenware, cookware and homeware items catering to cooking enthusiasts (the “Acquisition”). The Acquisition was for a cash purchase price of $1,000,000, and incremental earnout payments potentially aggregating up to $1,250,000. The incremental earnout payments are dependent on the opening and continuing in operation, at the Company’s discretion, of up to 50 free-standing stores (or specialty departments within the Company’s stores) operating under the Chef Central or other agreed upon branding.  

Ron Eisenberg, the son of Warren Eisenberg, the Company’s Co-chairman, is the founder and owner of Chef Central, and will join the Company as an employee to build Chef Central branded stores or departments. He brings more than 30 years of specialty retail experience, having opened the first Chef Central store in 1999 and prior to that having served in a number of operational roles with the Company from 1984 - 1997. The Acquisition was approved by the Company’s independent directors, who were advised by independent legal counsel. Warren Eisenberg recused himself from deliberations relating to the Acquisition.  

The Company does not expect the Acquisition to materially impact its results of operations or consolidated financial position.
