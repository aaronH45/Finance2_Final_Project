CEO Comments

Michael Kneeland, chief executive officer of United Rentals, said, "We were very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which benefited from broad-based demand. While rental rates remained a year-on-year headwind, our sequential rate performance was somewhat better than expected, and OEC volumes were robust through the end of the quarter. These factors helped us exceed the upper-band of guidance on total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the full year."

Kneeland continued, "2017 should be a year of notable growth for us on several fronts. We expect to close the NES acquisition early in the second quarter and immediately embark on our integration plan. The transaction should be accretive to earnings, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow this year. Once the acquisition is complete, we will issue new 2017 guidance to reflect the combined operations." 

Kneeland added, “In addition to M&A investment, we expect our performance to be driven by broad-based market opportunities and growing demand. Our confidence in the cycle is supported by internal data, customer sentiment, and the strength of key leading indicators. Longer-term, we expect our 2017 strategic investments in increased capital spending, sales and marketing, digital and Project XL to extend our market position and enhance future profitability."

2017 Outlook

The company provided the following outlook for the full year 2017. The company plans to update its 2017 outlook upon completion of the NES acquisition. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Free Cash Flow and Fleet Size

For the full year 2016 and 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.953 billion and $1.995 billion, respectively. For the full year 2016, free cash flow was $1.182 billion, after total rental and non-rental gross capital expenditures of $1.339 billion. By comparison, free cash flow for the full year 2015 was $919 million after total rental and non-rental gross capital expenditures of $1.636 billion. 

The size of the rental fleet was $8.99 billion of original equipment cost at December 31, 2016, compared with $8.73 billion at December 31, 2015. The age of the rental fleet was 45.2 months on an OEC-weighted basis at December 31, 2016, compared with 43.1 months at December 31, 2015.

Share Repurchase Program

In 2016, the company repurchased $517 million of common stock under its previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program. $373 million remains to be purchased under the program. In October 2016, the company paused repurchases under the program as it evaluated a number of potential acquisition opportunities. Earlier today, the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire NES in an all cash transaction. United Rentals intends to complete the share repurchase program; however, it will re-evaluate its decision to do so as it integrates NES and assesses other potential uses of capital.

Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) 

Return on invested capital was 8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 50 basis points year-over-year. The company’s ROIC metric uses after-tax operating income for the trailing 12 months divided by average stockholders’ equity, debt and deferred taxes, net of average cash. To mitigate the volatility related to fluctuations in the company’s tax rate from period to period, the federal statutory tax rate of 35% is used to calculate after-tax operating income.7 

Conference Call 

United Rentals will hold a conference call tomorrow, Thursday, January 26, 2017, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The conference call number is 844-515-1184 (international: 478-219-0888). The conference call will also be available live by audio webcast at unitedrentals.com, where it will be archived until the next earnings call. The replay number for the call is 404-537-3406, passcode is 47825270.

6.Information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to the comparable GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort, as discussed below[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-GAAP Measures  

Free cash flow, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share (adjusted EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of rental and non-rental equipment plus proceeds from sales of rental and non-rental equipment and excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired RSC fleet. Adjusted EPS represents EPS plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, the impact on interest expense related to the fair value adjustment of acquired RSC indebtedness, the impact on depreciation related to acquired RSC fleet and property and equipment, the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired RSC fleet, merger related intangible asset amortization, asset impairment charge and the loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities and amendment of ABL facility. The company believes that: (i) free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements; (ii) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced; and (iii) adjusted EPS provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, none of these measures should be considered as alternatives to net income, cash flows from operating activities or earnings per share under GAAP as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. 

Information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The company is not able to provide reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the provision for income taxes. Preparation of such reconciliations would require a forward-looking balance sheet, statement of income and statement of cash flow, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such forward-looking financial statements are unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The company provides a range for its adjusted EBITDA forecast that it believes will be achieved, however it cannot accurately predict all the components of the adjusted EBITDA calculation. The company provides an adjusted EBITDA forecast because it believes that adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the company’s results under GAAP, provides useful information for the reasons noted above. However, adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity.

ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GAAP RECONCILIATION

We define “earnings per share – adjusted” as the sum of earnings per share – GAAP, as reported plus the impact of the following special items: merger related costs, merger related intangible asset amortization, impact on rental depreciation related to acquired RSC fleet and property and equipment, impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired RSC fleet, impact on interest expense related to fair value adjustment of acquired RSC indebtedness, restructuring charge, asset impairment charge and loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities and amendment of ABL facility. Management believes that earnings per share - adjusted provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, earnings per share - adjusted is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, earnings per share - adjusted should not be considered an alternative to GAAP earnings per share. The table below provides a reconciliation between earnings per share – GAAP, as reported, and earnings per share – adjusted.

EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA GAAP RECONCILIATION

(In millions)

EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment, and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired RSC fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company’s results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliation, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. The table below provides a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(A) Our EBITDA margin was 47.4% and 47.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 46.3% and 47.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(B) Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 49.2% and 48.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 47.9% and 48.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(In millions)

We define free cash flow as (i) net cash provided by operating activities less (ii) purchases of rental and non-rental equipment plus (iii) proceeds from sales of rental and non-rental equipment, and excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements. However, free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. Accordingly, free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity.
