 Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

Loews Corporation (the “Company”) is furnishing this Current Report on Form 8-K/A as Amendment No. 1 to its Current Report on Form 8-K originally furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 6, 2017. The purpose of this Amendment No. 1 is to announce revised financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.  

On February 13, 2017, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (“Diamond Offshore”), a 53% owned subsidiary of the Company announced it has revised its previously announced preliminary earnings for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. The revision resulted from Diamond Offshore’s discovery during the process of completing its year-end financial reporting process that its liability for uncertain tax positions, in certain foreign jurisdictions, did not appropriately reflect changes in foreign exchange rates. The majority of the impact was related to the devaluation of the Egyptian Pound which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a result of that revision, the Company’s previously reported net income and book value per share have also been revised as follows:
