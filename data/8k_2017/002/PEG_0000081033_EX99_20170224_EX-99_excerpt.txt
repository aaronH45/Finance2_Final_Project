PSEG ANNOUNCES 2016 RESULTS  

NET INCOME OF $1.75 PER SHARE  

Non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $2.90 Per Share  

Common Dividend Increased 4.9%  

Non-GAAP 2017 Operating Earnings Guidance $2.80 - $3.00 Per Share  

(February 24, 2017 – Newark, NJ) Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) reported 2016 Net Income of $887 million, or $1.75 per share as compared to Net Income of $1,679 million, or $3.30 per share for 2015. Non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the year 2016 were $1,475 million or $2.90 per share compared to 2015 non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $1,476 million or $2.91 per share. Net Income for 2016 was largely impacted by expenses associated with the early retirement of coal-gas units at the Hudson and Mercer generating stations and reserves for a leveraged lease impairment. Net Income for 2015 includes insurance proceeds for the recovery of storm costs.  

PSEG also reported a Net Loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $98 million, or $0.19 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2015 Net Income of $309 million, or $0.60 per share. Non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $279 million, or $0.54 per share compared to fourth quarter 2015 non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $255 million, or $0.50 per share. Net Loss in the fourth quarter reflects the impact of incremental depreciation expense and other expenses of $555 million pre-tax associated with the early retirement of the Hudson and Mercer coal/gas-fired generating stations.  

“We delivered strong results in 2016 with full year non-GAAP Operating Earnings solidly within the range of our guidance” said Ralph Izzo, chairman, president and chief executive officer. “Continued growth at our regulated utility and a disciplined approach to expenses across Enterprise supported results. The Board’s recent decision to increase the common dividend by 4.9% to the indicative annual level of $1.72 per share represents confidence in our firm’s investment strategy and an acknowledgment of our strong financial condition.”  

Management uses non-GAAP Operating Earnings in its internal analysis, and in communications with investors and analysts, as a consistent measure for comparing PSEG’s financial performance to previous financial results. Non-GAAP Operating Earnings exclude the impact of returns (losses) associated with the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT), Mark-to-Market (MTM) accounting and material one-time items such as the previously noted Hudson and Mercer retirements and lease impairment.  

The tables below provide a reconciliation of PSEG’s Net Income to non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the full year and fourth quarter. See Attachment 11 for a complete list of items excluded from Net Income in the determination of non-GAAP Operating Earnings. The presentation of non-GAAP Operating Earnings is intended to complement, and should not be considered an alternative to, the presentation of Net Income, which is an indicator of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, non-GAAP Operating Earnings as presented in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Ralph Izzo went on to say, “We continue to pursue opportunities to enhance earnings and reduce financial risk. Actions to transition our business mix in response to changing market conditions have supported earnings. For 2017, we forecast non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $2.80 - $3.00 per share. Based on the growth in our regulated utility’s investment program, PSE&G’s Net Income is forecast to grow 8.5% at the mid-point of 2017’s guidance  

 to represent 66% of our forecast non-GAAP Operating Earnings. Our investment program, coupled with the impact from retirement of Hudson and Mercer (which is excluded from our non-GAAP Operating Earnings) is expected to improve the resiliency of our infrastructure and the economic efficiency of our generating fleet. Our ultimate goal is to provide an attractive earnings and dividend profile as we also deliver value to the customer. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to meet our goals.”  

The following table outlines PSEG’s 2016 non-GAAP Operating Earnings by subsidiary and expectations for 2017.  

2017 Non-GAAP Operating Earnings Guidance and  

2016 Non-GAAP Operating Earnings  

($ millions, except EPS)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Due to the forward looking nature of non-GAAP Operating Earnings guidance, PSEG is unable to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management is unable to project certain reconciling items, in particular MTM and NDT gains (losses), for future periods due to market volatility.  

Non-GAAP Operating Earnings Review and Outlook by Operating Subsidiary  

See Attachments 5 and 6 for detail regarding the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year reconciliations for each of PSEG’s businesses.  

PSE&G  

PSE&G reported Net Income of $193 million ($0.38 per share) for the fourth quarter bringing full year Net Income to $889 million ($1.75 per share). On a comparative basis, PSE&G reported Net Income of $156 million ($0.31 per share) and $787 million ($1.55 per share) for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, respectively.  

PSE&G’s Net Income in the fourth quarter continued to benefit from a return on its expanded investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure.  

Growth in PSE&G’s investment in transmission, and the absence of an adjustment to Net Income for bonus depreciation in the year-ago quarter improved quarter-over-quarter Net Income comparisons by $0.06 per share. More normal weather conditions relative to unseasonably mild weather in the year-ago quarter improved Net Income by $0.01 per share. A decline in O&M of $0.03 per share and other expenses was offset by an increase in depreciation expense and taxes.  

PSE&G implemented a $121 million increase in revenue under the company’s transmission formula rate on January 1, 2017. Transmission revenues are adjusted each year to reflect an update of the company’s investment program. PSE&G’s investment in transmission grew to $6.7 billion of rate base at the end of 2016, or 44% of the company’s consolidated rate base of $15.2 billion at the end of the year.  

Electric sales, on a weather-normalized basis, were flat in the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago period as an increase in demand from the commercial sector offset a decline in sales to residential and industrial customers. For the year, the continued degradation of the industrial sector and increases in efficiency offset the impact of residential customer growth on sales. Weather-normalized firm gas sales declined slightly during the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago quarter and declined 1.9% for the full year.  

PSE&G invested $2.8 billion during 2016 to upgrade and expand its transmission and distribution system. PSE&G upgraded 177 miles of gas pipes in more than 80 towns as it continues work under its three-year $905 million Gas System Modernization Program. Upgrades to the electric distribution system continue under the $1.2 billion Energy Strong infrastructure program.  

For the 15th year in a row, PSE&G’s work to protect and strengthen the system yielded recognition as the most reliable electric utility in the Mid-Atlantic.  

PSE&G’s Net Income for 2017 is forecasted at $945 million - $985 million.  

PSEG Power  

PSEG Power reported a Net Loss of $302 million ($0.59 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus Net Income of $149 million ($0.29 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016, PSEG Power reported Net Income of $18 million ($0.04 per share) versus Net Income for the full year 2015 of $856 million ($1.68 per share).  

PSEG Power reported non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $69 million ($0.13 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2016 and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $155 million bringing full year non-GAAP Operating Earnings to $514 million ($1.01 per share) and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to $1,201 million. On a comparative basis, PSEG Power reported non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $95 million ($0.19 per share) and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $218 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 and non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $653 million ($1.29 per share) and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $1,435 million for the full year 2015.  

Management believes non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. Management also believes that non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure operating performance without regard to items such as income tax expense, interest expense and depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon, among other things, the book value of assets, capital structure and whether assets were constructed or acquired. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA also allows investors and other users to assess the underlying financial performance of our fleet before management’s decision to deploy capital. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our non-GAAP Operating Earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. See Attachment 12 for a complete list of items excluded from Net Income in the determination of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is intended to complement, and should not be considered an alternative to the presentation of Net Income, which is an indicator of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.  

Power’s Net Loss for the fourth quarter reflects the impact of incremental depreciation and other expenses of $555 million pre-tax associated with the decision to retire the Hudson and Mercer coal/gas-fired generating stations on June 1, 2017. The company’s fourth quarter results also reflect the impact of a decline in energy prices on output and margins.  

A decline in the average price received on energy hedges reduced Power’s quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP Operating Earnings by $0.05 per share. A reduction in output was partially offset by an improvement in off-system gas sales resulting in a net reduction of $0.01 per share in quarterly Net Income(Loss) comparisons. An increase in O&M expense of $0.03 per share associated with the cost of a planned refueling at Power’s 100% owned Hope Creek nuclear station was offset by a decline in taxes and other items.  

Output from Power’s generating facilities was 7.6% lower in the fourth quarter compared to year-ago levels. Quarterly comparisons were affected by the refueling outage at Hope Creek, major maintenance on the gas-fired CCGTs during the shoulder period in the market and lower demand. For the year, output was 6.7% lower. The nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 86.9% producing 29.6 TWh of energy (57% of total energy output for 2016). Power’s gas-fired CCGT fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 57.2% for the year producing 16.4 TWh of energy (32% of 2016’s total energy output). The coal-fired fleet (primarily Keystone and Conemaugh) generated 4.8 TWh of energy during the year (9% of 2016’s total energy output) with the remaining output produced from Power’s peaking generating assets.  

Power is forecasting output for 2017 of 49 - 51 TWh – a slight change from 51.5 TWh of energy produced in 2016. Following completion of the Basic Generation Service (BGS) auction in New Jersey in February 2017, Power enters the year with 100% of its 2017  

 baseload generation hedged. Approximately 80% - 85% of anticipated annual production is hedged at an average price of $46 per MWh. Power has hedged approximately 50 - 55% of its forecast generation in 2018 of 55 TWh at an average price of $43 per MWh. For 2019, Power has hedged 15 - 20% of forecast production of 60 TWh at an average price of $43 per MWh. Power assumes BGS volumes will represent approximately 11 TWh in 2017 – consistent with 2016 deliveries of 11.1 TWh under the BGS contract.  

The forecast increase in output for 2018 and 2019 reflects the commercial start-up in mid-2018 of 1,300 MWs of new gas-fired combined cycle capacity at the Keys Energy Center in Maryland and Sewaren in New Jersey, and the mid-2019 commercial start-up of the 485 MW gas-fired combined cycle power plant at Bridgeport Harbor, Connecticut.  

Power’s non-GAAP Operating Earnings for 2017 are forecast at $435 - $510 million. The forecast represents non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 of $1,080 – $1,210 million.  

Due to the forward looking nature of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA guidance, PSEG is unable to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management is unable to project certain reconciling items, in particular MTM and NDT gains (losses), for future periods due to market volatility.  

PSEG Enterprise/Other  

PSEG Enterprise/Other reported Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $11 million ($0.02 per share) compared to Net Income of $4 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year, PSEG Enterprise/Other reported a Net Loss of $20 million, ($0.04 per share) compared to Net Income in 2015 of $36 million ($0.07 per share). Net Income for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 include pre-tax charges of $10 million and $147 million, respectively related to an impairment of leveraged lease residual values and an estimated loss as a result of liquidity issues currently facing NRG REMA.  

Non-GAAP Operating Earnings for PSEG Enterprise/Other in the fourth quarter 2016 were $17 million ($0.03 per share) compared to $4 million in the year-ago quarter. The results for the fourth quarter brought PSEG Enterprise/Other non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the full year to $72 million ($0.14 per share) versus $36 million ($0.07 per share) in 2015.  

The increase in non-GAAP Operating Earnings quarter-over-quarter reflects the absence of certain corporate expenditures as well as certain tax items at PSEG Energy Holdings and contractual payments associated with the operation of PSEG Long Island.  

For 2017, non-GAAP Operating Earnings for PSEG Enterprise/Other are forecast to be $35 million.  

Capital Expenditures  

PSEG currently plans to invest approximately $10.2 billion over 2017 – 2019 primarily in PSE&G (77%) and PSEG Power (23%).  

Pension Expense  

PSEG, at the end of 2016, merged its three qualified defined benefit pension plans and the pension plans’ assets into one plan. As a result, total net periodic benefit costs are expected to decrease by approximately $48 million (net of amounts capitalized) in 2017 from what they would have been without the merger of the plans, and total periodic benefit expense in 2017 is also expected to be $22 million lower than 2016’s level of expense. This is due to a change in the amortization period for gains and losses for the merged plan which resulted in lower amortization than that of the individual plans.
