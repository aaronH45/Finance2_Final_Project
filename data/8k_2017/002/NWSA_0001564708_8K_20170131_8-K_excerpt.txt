 Item 3.01  Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.     

As previously disclosed, Elaine L. Chao notified News Corporation (the "Company") that she will resign from the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") effective if and when she is confirmed as Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation. On January 31, 2017, the Company notified the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") that, as a result of Ms. Chao's resignation, effective on such date, the Company is no longer in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(b)(1), which requires that a majority of the Board be comprised of independent Directors. Also on January 31, 2017, in response to the Company's notice, NASDAQ issued a letter to the Company acknowledging the Company's noncompliance and confirming that, consistent with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(b)(1)(A), the Company can rely on a cure period allowing the Company to regain compliance by the earlier of the Company's next annual meeting of stockholders and January 31, 2018; or, if the Company's next annual meeting of stockholders is held before July 31, 2017, by July 31, 2017.

The Board is currently conducting a search process, which includes engagement of an independent search firm, and intends to appoint an additional independent Director to the Board prior to the end of the cure period.
