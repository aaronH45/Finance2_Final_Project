Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures

As used in this press release the term “reported” refers to measures under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The term “adjusted” refers to non-GAAP measures as follows: (i) for the purpose of income measures the term “adjusted” refers to operating performance measures that exclude special items such as the gain on sale of the Focus Diagnostics products business, gain on the contribution to the clinical trials joint venture, retirement of debt and related refinancing charges, restructuring and integration charges, recognition of certain income tax benefits and other items; (ii) the term “adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization” represents the company's diluted EPS before the impact of special items and amortization; (iii) reference to “revenues on an equivalent basis” when comparing 2016 results to 2015 represents 2015 reported revenues excluding all clinical trials testing and Celera products revenues and Focus Diagnostics products revenues subsequent to April 2015; and (iv) reference to “revenues on an equivalent basis” when comparing full year 2017 estimates to 2016 represents 2016 reported revenues excluding all Focus Diagnostics products revenues.

Non-GAAP “adjusted” measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to GAAP results. Non-GAAP “adjusted” measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under GAAP. Management may use these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts or for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and analysts to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, as well as to analyze the underlying trends in our business and to assess our performance. The additional tables attached below include reconciliations of adjusted measures to GAAP measures.
