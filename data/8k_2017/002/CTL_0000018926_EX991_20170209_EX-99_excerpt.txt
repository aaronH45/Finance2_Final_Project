    The full amount of each of the Term Loan Facilities shall be available to be drawn by the Borrower in U.S. dollars in a single drawing on the Closing Date. 

    Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Facilities that are repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. 

 Final Maturity and Amortization of Term Loan Facilities   The Term Loan A Facility will mature on the date that is five (5) years after the Closing Date and will amortize at a rate of 5% per annum (payable in (4) equal quarterly installments, beginning after the first full quarter ending after the Closing Date), with the balance payable on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date. 

    The Term Loan B Facility will mature on the date that is seven (7) years after the Closing Date and will amortize at a rate of 1% per annum (payable in (4) equal quarterly installments, beginning after the first full quarter ending after the Closing Date), with the balance payable on the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date. 

    The Asset Sale Bridge Facility shall mature on the earlier of (i) the date of consummation of the Data Center Sale following the Closing Date and (ii) the date that is 364 after the Closing Date and will not be subject to scheduled amortization prior to such date. 

    Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Loan Documents shall provide the right for individual Lenders under the Term Loan Facilities to agree to extend the maturity date of the outstanding Term Loans upon the request of the Borrower and without the consent of any other Lender pursuant to customary procedures to be agreed (any such loans that have been so extended, the “Extended Term Loans”); it being understood that each Lender under the applicable tranche or tranches that are being extended shall have the opportunity to participate in such extension on the same terms and conditions as each other Lender in such tranche or tranches; provided, that it is understood that no existing Lender will have any obligation to commit to any such extension. The terms of the Extended Term Loans shall be substantially similar to the Term Loans except for interest rates, fees, amortization (so long as, prior to the final stated maturity of the tranche of Term Loans being extended, the 

4  

    amortization of such Extended Term Loans does not exceed the quarterly rate of amortization applicable to such tranche of Term Loans prior to the extension), final maturity date, provisions requiring optional and mandatory prepayments to be directed on a pro rata basis or less than pro rata basis (but not, prior to the maturity of the tranche so extended, on a greater than pro rata basis) to such Extended Term Loans and certain other provisions to be agreed, provided that the Extended Term Loans shall not benefit from Guarantees or Collateral that do not also benefit the existing Term Loans, and further provided that other terms of the Extended Term Loans may differ from the Term Loans to the extent such differences do not apply until after the final stated maturity of the Term Loans and then outstanding Revolving Credit Facilities. 

    The Senior Administrative Agent and Borrower shall be permitted to effect such amendments to the Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate to give effect to the immediately preceding paragraph, including conforming amendments (which may be in the form of an amendment and restatement), without the consent of any Lender other than the Lenders agreeing to extend such Extended Term Loans. 

 Incremental Credit Facilities   The Borrower shall have the right to increase the size of any of the Term Loan Facilities and/or incur additional tranches of term loans (“Incremental Term Loans”; any incremental term loans with amortization in excess of 1% per year that are marketed principally to commercial banks (as determined by the Senior Administrative Agent) being referred to as “Incremental Term A Loans” and any other Incremental Term Loans being referred to as “Incremental Term B Loans”) and/or increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility (“Incremental Revolving Commitments” and, together with Incremental Term Loans, each an “Incremental Facility”), at any time after the Closing Date from willing Lenders and/or eligible assignees up to an aggregate total principal amount not to exceed the sum of (A) $1,500.0 million plus (B) an additional amount if, after giving effect to the incurrence of such additional amount and the use of proceeds thereof (and, if the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Facility (including any Incremental Revolving Commitments), exceeds $2,000.0 million, assuming that such excess amount of commitments is fully drawn), the ratio (the “Priority Leverage Ratio”) of (x) Consolidated Total Priority Funded Debt (to be defined in the same manner 

5  

    as Consolidated Total Funded Debt (as defined in the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement) but to exclude (i) any unsecured indebtedness of the Borrower that is not guaranteed by any restricted subsidiary of the Borrower (other than any guarantee that is subordinated to such restricted subsidiary’s guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities) and (ii) any indebtedness of any Guarantor that is contractually subordinated to the obligations under the Senior Facilities (“Priority Debt”)) to (y) Consolidated EBITDA (to be defined in a manner consistent with the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement but to include, without duplication (i) to the extent otherwise reducing such Consolidated EBITDA for the relevant period, an addback for up to $580 million of unusual or non-recurring integration expenses in connection with integration of the Acquired Business, (ii) up to $515 million of run-rate cost savings or other synergies expected by the Borrower to be realized prior to the date that is 24 months after the Closing Date (net of amounts already reflected in Consolidated EBITDA) as a result of specifically identified cost savings initiatives or synergies and (iii) other run-rate cost savings or other synergies in connection with acquisitions (including the Acquisition) expected to be realized within 12 months from the date of determination as a result of specifically identified cost savings initiatives or synergies) of the Borrower for the most recent four fiscal quarter period, on a pro forma basis, would not exceed 3.0 to 1.0, subject to the following: 

    (i)   no event of default has occurred and is continuing, or would immediately occur after giving effect to, such Incremental Facilities (except in the case of Incremental Term Loans to be used to provide funding for any permitted acquisition or permitted investment that the Borrower or one or more of its restricted subsidiaries is contractually committed to consummate and whose consummation is not conditioned on the availability of, or on obtaining, third party financing (any such acquisition or investment, a “Limited Condition Transaction”), in each case, the standard will be (i) no event of default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time the definitive agreement in respect thereof is entered into and (ii) no payment or bankruptcy event of default shall exist and be continuing at the time the applicable transaction is consummated);

7  

       Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Commitments (although any representations and warranties which expressly relate to a given date or period shall be required to be true and correct in all material respects (without duplication of any materiality qualifiers set forth therein) as of the respective date or for the respective period, as the case may be); 

    (vi)   the terms of the Incremental Term Loans shall be otherwise reasonably satisfactory in all respects to the Senior Administrative Agent to the extent that such terms, except to the extent set forth above, are not consistent with the applicable Term Loan Facility; 

    (vii)   any Incremental Revolving Commitment will be documented solely as an increase to the commitments with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility, without any change in terms except for such upfront fees as may be agreed between the Lenders providing such Incremental Revolving Commitments and the Borrower; and 

    (viii)   any such Incremental Term Loans shall be entitled to benefit from the same guarantees as, and be secured on a pari passu basis by the same Collateral (as defined below) securing the Senior Credit Facilities. 

    None of the existing Lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities will be required to provide any Incremental Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Commitments, and any decision whether or not to do so by any such Lender shall be made at the sole discretion of such Lender. 

    For purposes of this Term Sheet, unless the context otherwise requires, Incremental Term Loans shall constitute “Term Loans” and shall be subject to the provisions of this Term Sheet (including mandatory prepayment requirements) to the same extent as Term Loans, except as provided otherwise herein. 

 Revolving Credit Facility   A senior secured first lien revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Term Loan Facilities, the “Senior Credit Facilities”) in an aggregate principal amount equal to $2,000.0 million (with the loans thereunder referred to herein as the  

8  

    “Revolving Credit Loans” and, together with the Term Loans, the “Loans”). Amounts repaid under the Revolving Credit Facility may be reborrowed, subject to the limitations set forth herein. 

    The Revolving Credit Facility will be available in U.S. dollars. 

 Maturity of Revolving Credit Facility   The Revolving Credit Facility shall be available to the Borrower on a revolving basis during the period commencing on the Closing Date (subject to the limitations set forth under the caption “Use of Proceeds” set forth below) and ending on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date (the “Revolving Credit Termination Date”); provided that the Loan Documents shall provide the right for individual Lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility to agree to extend the maturity date of the outstanding commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility upon the request of the Borrower and without the consent of any other Lender pursuant to customary procedures to be agreed; provided, that no existing Lender will have any obligation to commit to any such extension. 

 Letters of Credit   A portion of the Revolving Credit Facility not in excess of $400.0 million shall be available for the issuance of standby letters of credit (the “Letters of Credit”) by each of the Senior Arrangers (or an affiliate thereof) and other Lenders designated from time to time by the Borrower (with such Lender’s consent), with such sublimit to be divided among the Senior Arrangers (and their affiliates) based on the amount of their respective commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Closing Date (in such capacity, each, an “Issuing Lender”), which Letters of Credit shall be risk participated to all Lenders with commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility on a pro rata basis, to support obligations of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries. The face amount of any outstanding Letters of Credit will reduce availability under the Revolving Credit Facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis. No Letter of Credit shall have an expiration date after the earlier of (i) one year after the date of issuance, unless otherwise agreed by the Issuing Lender and (ii) five business days prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date; provided that any Letter of Credit may provide for the automatic renewal thereof for additional periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) above, except to the extent cash collateralized or backstopped pursuant to arrangements reasonably acceptable to the relevant Issuing Lender). 

9  

    Drawings under any Letter of Credit shall be reimbursed by the Borrower (whether with the Borrower’s own funds or with the proceeds of Revolving Credit Loans) on the immediately succeeding business day. To the extent that the Borrower does not so reimburse the Issuing Lender, the Lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to reimburse the Issuing Lender on a pro rata basis based on their respective Revolving Credit Facility commitments. 

 Swing Line Loans   A portion of the Revolving Credit Facility not in excess of $100.0 million shall be available on same-day notice for swing line loans (the “Swing Line Loans”) from the Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the “Swing Line Lender”). Except as otherwise provided herein, any such Swing Line Loans will reduce availability under the Revolving Credit Facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Each Lender under the Revolving Credit Facility shall acquire an irrevocable and unconditional pro rata participation in each Swing Line Loan. 

 Use of Proceeds   The proceeds of the Term Loans will be used directly or indirectly to finance, in part, the Acquisition and the Refinancing, and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing. 

    The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Loans will be used (i) on the Closing Date, in an amount up to $1,000.0 million to finance a portion of the Transactions plus additional amounts for ordinary course working capital needs and (ii) after the Closing Date for the working capital and general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its subsidiaries (including permitted acquisitions, capital expenditures and permitted distributions). (It is understood and agreed that Letters of Credit may be issued on the Closing to replace or provide credit support for any existing letters of credit of the Acquired Business (including by “grandfathering” such existing letters of credit into the Revolving Credit Facility). 

    The proceeds of any Incremental Facility will be used by the Borrower for general corporate purposes of Borrower and its subsidiaries (including, without limitation, permitted acquisitions, capital expenditures and permitted distributions) or otherwise as set forth in the definitive documents with respect thereto.

 III. Certain Payment Provisions  

 Fees and Interest Rates   As set forth on Annex I hereto. 

 Optional Prepayments and Commitment Reductions   Optional prepayments of borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities and optional reductions of the unutilized portion of the commitments under the Senior Credit Facilities will be permitted at any time, in minimum principal amounts to be agreed upon, without premium or penalty (subject to (i) reimbursement of the Lenders’ redeployment costs in the case of a prepayment of LIBO Rate Loans other than on the last day of the relevant interest period and (ii) in the case of the Term B Loans, payments of an amount provided below under the caption “Call Protection on Term B Loans”). Voluntary prepayments of the Term Loan Credit Facilities shall be applied to remaining scheduled amortization payments as directed by the Borrower. 

 Mandatory Prepayments and Commitment Reductions   The following amounts will be applied to prepay the Term Loans or, if all Term Loans have then been repaid, to prepay Revolving Credit Loans (or, if none, to cash collateralize Letters of Credit thereunder), without a reduction of the commitments thereunder, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the Senior Credit Facilities Documentation: 

    •   100% of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of indebtedness after the Closing Date (other than indebtedness permitted under the Loan Documents) by the Borrower or any of its restricted subsidiaries; 

    •   100% of the net cash proceeds in excess of a threshold to be mutually and reasonably agreed of any non-ordinary course sale or other disposition of assets by the Borrower or any of its restricted subsidiaries (other than New Lynx Holdco and its subsidiaries) (excluding sales of inventory in the ordinary course and including as a result of casualty or condemnation) (subject to customary exceptions to be agreed, including the right to apply such proceeds to repay any debt secured thereby or, in the case of a sale by a non-Guarantor restricted subsidiary, any other Priority Debt of the subsidiary selling or disposing of such assets, and subject to customary limitations if transferring such proceeds would be prohibited by law or debt agreements of a non-Guarantor restricted subsidiary or would cause 

11  

       materially adverse consequences in connection with repatriation) and subject to the right to reinvest such proceeds within 12 months of receipt (or, if the Borrower or the applicable restricted subsidiary has entered into a binding commitment with respect to such reinvestment within such 12 month period, within 18 months of receipt) in long-term assets used or useful in a permitted business) with an ability to apply a pro rata portion of such proceeds to prepay pari passu secured indebtedness (and, in the case of a prepayment of revolving indebtedness, to permanently reduce commitments in respect thereof); and 

    •   50% of “excess cash flow” of The Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries (to be defined in the Senior Credit Facilities Documentation and to be net the amount of internally generated funds expended during the applicable year in respect of permitted restricted payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions and certain other investments1 and, in any event, giving dollar-for-dollar credit for voluntary prepayments (to the extent not funded with the proceeds of non-revolving indebtedness) to the Term Loan Facilities and the Revolving Credit Facility, to the extent such prepayments of the Revolving Credit Facility are accompanied by a permanent and concurrent commitment reduction thereunder, and to any other Priority Debt (in the case of revolving commitments, to the extent accompanied by a permanent reduction in commitments) for each fiscal year of the Borrower (commencing with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, and pro rated for the number of full months in such fiscal year following the Closing Date)), with step-downs to 25% and 0% of “excess cash flow” based on achieving Total Leverage Ratios as of the last day of the applicable year that are 0.50:1.00 and 1.00:1.00, respectively, less than the Total Leverage Ratio on the Closing Date. 

    Mandatory prepayments of Term Loans shall be applied to each class of Term Loans then outstanding on a pro rata basis and to scheduled amortization thereunder as directed by the Borrower; provided that proceeds from the Data Center Sale shall be applied to prepay Asset Sale Bridge Loans prior to being applied to prepay any other class of Term Loans.  

 1  To include substantially all investments other than intercompany investments, cash equivalents, and investments in exchange for equity.  

12  

    The Revolving Credit Loans will be prepaid and the Letters of Credit will be cash collateralized to the extent such extensions of credit at any time exceed the aggregate commitments in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility. 

 Call Protection on Term B Loans   The Borrower shall pay a “prepayment premium” in connection with any Repricing Event (as defined below) with respect to all or any portion of the Term B Loans that occurs on or before the date occurring six months after the Closing Date (the “Soft Call Date”), in an amount equal to 1.0% of the principal amount of the Term B Loans subject to such Repricing Event. The term “Repricing Event” shall mean (i) any prepayment or repayment of Term B Loans with the proceeds of, or any conversion of such Term B Loans into, any new or replacement tranche of term loans bearing interest at an “effective” interest rate less than the “effective” interest rate applicable to such Term B Loans (as such comparative rates are determined by the Senior Administrative Agent in consultation with the Borrower), and (ii) any amendment to the Term Loan B Facility that, directly or indirectly, reduces the “effective” interest rate applicable to the Term B Loans under the Term Loan B Facility (in each case, with original issue discount and upfront fees, which shall be deemed to constitute like amounts of original issue discount, being equated to interest margins in a manner consistent with generally accepted financial practice based on an assumed four-year life to maturity), including any mandatory assignment in connection therewith with respect to each Lender that refuses to consent to such amendment. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, in no event will any prepayment premium be payable pursuant to this paragraph in connection with the occurrence of a Change of Control (to be defined in the Senior Credit Facilities Documentation). 

    After the Soft Call Date, the Term Loan B Facility may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs).

    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Collateral shall exclude the following: (i) any interest in real property; (ii) motor vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of title (except to the extent perfection can be obtained by filing of financing statements), letter of credit rights (except to the extent perfection can be obtained by filing of financing statements) and commercial tort claims with a value of less than an

    amount to be agreed; (iii) any lease, license or other similar agreement or any property subject to a purchase money security interest or similar arrangement to the extent that a grant of a security interest therein would violate or invalidate such lease, license or other agreement or purchase money arrangement or create a right of termination in favor of any other party thereto (other than a Borrower or a Guarantor) after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of applicable law, other than proceeds and receivables thereof, the assignment of which is expressly deemed effective under applicable law notwithstanding such prohibition; (iv) any intent to use trademark applications, to the extent that the grant of a security interest therein would impair the validity or enforceability of, or render void or voidable or result in the cancellation of the applicable grantor’s right, title or interest therein or in any trademark issued as a result of such application under applicable federal law; (v)(i) any governmental licenses or state or local franchises, licenses, permits, charters and authorizations, to the extent security interests therein are prohibited or restricted thereby and (ii) any equity in a regulated subsidiary or any asset owned by a regulated subsidiary to the extent prohibited by any law, rule or regulation or that would if pledged, in the good faith judgment of the Borrower, result in adverse regulatory consequences or impair the conduct of the business of Cougar such subsidiaries (in the case of this clause (v), subject to a covenant to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary approvals or authorizations); and (vi) any equity interests of unrestricted subsidiaries, and equity interests of any person that is not a wholly-owned restricted subsidiary to the extent the granting of a security interest therein would violate the terms of such person’s organizational documents or any shareholders’ agreement or joint venture agreement relating to such person; vii) any assets of any CFC or FSHCO, other than assets that are treated as “United States Property” pursuant to Section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code; and (viii) other exceptions to be mutually agreed upon (the foregoing described in clauses (i) through (viii) are collectively, the “Excluded Assets”). In addition, in no event shall (1) deposit or security account control agreements or control, lockbox or similar arrangements be required, (2) notices be required to be sent to account debtors or other contractual third parties unless an event of default has occurred and is continuing or (3) foreign-law governed security documents or perfection under foreign law be required. 

15  

    The liens on the Collateral securing the Senior Credit Facilities will rank pari passu with the liens securing the Secured Bridge Facility and/or Secured Notes pursuant to a customary pari passu intercreditor agreement. 

 Guarantees   The Guarantors will unconditionally, and jointly and severally, guarantee the obligations of the Borrower in respect of the Senior Credit Facilities and of the Borrower and any of its restricted subsidiaries in respect of the Permitted Secured Hedging Obligations and the Permitted Cash Management Obligations (the “Guarantees”). Such Guarantees will be set forth in the Senior Credit Facilities Documentation. All Guarantees shall be guarantees of payment and performance, and not of collection. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Credit Party shall be jointly and severally liable or guarantee or provide any collateral as security for any Permitted Secured Hedging Obligations if, and to the extent that such liability or such guaranty of such swap obligation is or becomes illegal under the Commodity Exchange Act (determined after giving effect to any keepwell or other support for the benefit of such Credit Party).
