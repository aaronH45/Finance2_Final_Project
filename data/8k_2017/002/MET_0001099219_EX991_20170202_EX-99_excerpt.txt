[MetLife Executive Vice President & CFO John Hele speaks from a studio at MetLife’s corporate headquarters in New York City]  

Hi, I’m John Hele and I am joining you from MetLife’s global headquarters in New York City to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results.  

2016 was a significant year for MetLife. We announced and made substantial progress on the planned separation of Brighthouse Financial, we launched a new enterprise strategy and brand, and we shed our systemically important financial institution—or SIFI—designation.  

After dropping to record lows in mid-2016, interest rates rose sharply in the fourth quarter, characterized by an 85 basis point increase in the 10-year U.S. treasury yield. For many years, MetLife has purchased derivatives to protect the company against the impact of low interest rates. These derivatives are assets carried at market value, but many of the liabilities they protect are at book value. This creates what is known as asymmetrical and non-economic accounting. [Shows slide 2]  

Due to the strong upward movement in rates, we experienced large derivative losses that impacted our fourth quarter and full year 2016 net income results.  

Economically, rising interest rates are very good for MetLife’s businesses and are a positive development.  

In the fourth quarter of 2016, MetLife reported a net loss of 2.1 billion dollars, compared to net income of 785 million dollars in the prior-year period. As I previously noted, this fourth quarter net loss included post-tax net derivative losses of 3.2 billion dollars, most of which was asymmetrical and non-economic.  

In the fourth quarter of 2016, MetLife reported operating earnings of 1.4 billion dollars, up 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015. On a per share basis, operating earnings were 1 dollar and 28 cents, up 4 percent. [Shows slide 3]  

Overall, MetLife fourth quarter 2016 operating earnings were aided by expense control, higher variable investment income and a lower tax rate, offset in part by weaker underwriting results.  

On a segment basis, the U.S., Asia, and EMEA delivered operating earnings above last year’s fourth quarter. Volume growth was a common theme helping to drive up year-over-year operating earnings for these segments. [Shows slide 4]  

A number of different factors impacted year-over-year operating earnings in Latin America, MetLife Holdings and Brighthouse Financial, resulting in lower operating earnings.  

Details regarding the key factors impacting our business segments’ performance are outlined in our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings news release dated February first.  

Book value per common share was down 3 percent to 49 dollars and 83 cents. [Shows slide 5]  

For the full year 2016, MetLife delivered net income of 697 million dollars. As I mentioned earlier, net derivative losses impacted full year 2016 net income.  

Full year operating earnings were 5.1 billion dollars, down 7 percent over 2015. On a per share basis, 2016 operating earnings were 4 dollars and 59 cents, down 6 percent from 2015.  

As we move forward in 2017, we believe that higher interest rates and a more favorable regulatory environment, combined with our new enterprise strategy, capital management and expense discipline, will position us for value creation.  

Thank you for watching.
