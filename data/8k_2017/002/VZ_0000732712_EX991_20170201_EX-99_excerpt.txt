Exchange Offers  

The first transaction consists of 18 separate private offers to exchange (the “Exchange Offers”) any and all of the outstanding series of notes listed below under the heading Exchange Offers (collectively, the “Old Notes”) in exchange for a combination of newly issued debt securities of Verizon (the “New Notes”) and, for certain specified series, cash, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum dated January 25, 2017 (the “Offering Memorandum” and, together with the accompanying exchange offer notice of guaranteed delivery, the “Exchange Offer Documents”).  

The Exchange Offers expired at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on January 31, 2017 (the “Exchange Offer Expiration Date”). The “Exchange Offer Settlement Date” with respect to the Exchange Offers will be promptly following the Exchange Offer Expiration Date and is expected to be February 3, 2017. In addition to the applicable Total Exchange Price (as  

 defined in the Offering Memorandum), Exchange Offer Eligible Holders (as defined below) whose Old Notes are accepted for exchange will be paid accrued and unpaid interest on such Old Notes to, but not including, the Exchange Offer Settlement Date. Interest will cease to accrue on the Exchange Offer Settlement Date for all Old Notes accepted, including those tendered through the guaranteed delivery procedures.  

On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum, the tables below provide the aggregate principal amount of each series of Old Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Exchange Offer Expiration Date and the aggregate principal amount of each series of Old Notes that Verizon expects to accept in connection with Verizon’s offers to:
