Item 8.01 Other Events

Johnson Controls International plc (the "Company") is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K ("Current Report") to revise certain financial information and related disclosures included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the year ended September 30, 2016 ("Annual Report"), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on November 23, 2016. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company determined that its Automotive Experience business ("Adient") met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation, which required retrospective application to financial information for all periods presented. Also in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company began evaluating the performance of its business segments primarily on segment earnings before interest, taxes and amortization ("EBITA"), which represents income from continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests, excluding general corporate expenses, intangible asset amortization, net financing charges, significant restructuring and impairment costs, and the net mark-to-market adjustments related to pension and postretirement plans. Historical information has been revised to present the comparable periods on a consistent basis. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-03, "Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs," and ASU No. 2015-07, "Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)," and applied the changes retrospectively to all periods. 

This Current Report and Exhibit 99.1 are being filed solely to recast financial information and revise certain related disclosures contained in the Annual Report to reflect Adient as a discontinued operation, the change in segment performance measure implemented during the Company's first quarter of 2017, and the retrospective changes for all periods presented for the adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 and 2015-07. 

Unaffected items and unaffected portions of the Annual Report have not been repeated in, and are not amended or modified by, this Current Report or Exhibit 99.1. The information in this Current Report with respect to the Company should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report and the subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of the Company for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2016, which was filed with the SEC on February 8, 2017. Other than as required to reflect Adient as a discontinued operation, the change in segment performance measure, and the retrospective changes of the adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 and 2015-07, each as described above and set forth in Exhibit 99.1, this Current Report does not reflect events that have occurred subsequent to the original filing date of the Annual Report, and does not modify or update in any way the disclosures made in the Annual Report. For information on events occurring since the filing of the Annual Report, please refer to the Company's subsequent filings with the SEC. The information contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K is not an amendment to, or a restatement of, the Annual Report.
