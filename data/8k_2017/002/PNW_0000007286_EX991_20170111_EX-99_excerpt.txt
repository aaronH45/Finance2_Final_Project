Powering Growth, Delivering Value29 ENVIRONMENTAL PLAN Regional Haze compliance is the biggest driver of environmental spend over the next few years Regional Haze / BART (SCR) Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants (ACI + Baghouse) Coal Combustion Residuals Cooling Water Intake Structures – CWA 316(b) EPA Ruling Announced in 1999, with site-specific requirements announced more recently MATS compliance by April 2015, with potential for one-year extension Announced on December 19, 2014 (Subtitle D) Announced in May 2014 Four Corners Units 4 & 5 Approximately $400M for SCRs in 2016-2018 (does not include CAPEX related to 4CA 7% interest) $0 APS estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the CCR rule for Four Corners is approximately $15 million, and its share of incremental costs for Cholla is in the range of $5 million to $40 million. APS expects to incur certain of these costs during 2016-2018 timeframe. Immaterial $0Cholla Unit 3 On September 11, 2014, APS announced a proposal to close Unit 2 by April 2016 and stop burning coal at the other APS-owned units (1 and 3) by the mid-2020’s. If EPA does not approve the plan, SCR for Unit 3 would cost approximately $100 million. $8M Navajo Plant Units 1-3 Up to ~$200M for SCRs and baghouses On July 28, 2014, EPA issued the final BART rule incorporating the better-than-BART alternative proposed by SRP and others Approximately $1 million Approximately $1 million To be determined Clean Power Plan: On August 3, 2015, the U.S. EPA issued its final rules to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants including those on Tribal lands. APS is reviewing the rules, while working closely with other utilities, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, the ACC, tribal officials and other impacted stakeholders to determine how best to proceed. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the Clean Power Plan pending judicial review, which temporarily delays compliance obligations. Note: Dollars shown at ownership. Estimates as of September 30, 2016. • Cholla: Unit 1 is not BART-eligible; Unit 2 retired on October 1, 2015; Unit 4 is owned by PacifiCorp. • SO2 NAAQS and greenhouse gas-related costs will be determined based upon EPA rule makings, with no spend occurring before 2016. • ACI = Activated Carbon Injection; NAAQS = National Ambient Air Quality Standard; SCR = Selective Catalytic Reduction control technology  

Powering Growth, Delivering Value30 Emissions • 820 MW of coal has been retired including 560 MW at Four Corners Units 1-3 in 2013 and 260 MW at Cholla Unit 2 as of October 1, 2015. • Four Corners: 2013 transaction to purchase Southern California Edison’s ownership in Units 4 and 5 and closure of units 1, 2 & 3 leads to expected reductions of emissions; particulates are expected to decline by 43%, NOx by 36%, CO2 by 30%, mercury by 61% and SO2 by 24%. • Cholla Power Plant: Closure of Unit 2 as of October 1, 2015 will reduce mercury emissions by 51%, particulates by 34%, NOx by 32%, and CO2 and SO2 by 23% each. We also announced plans to work with the U.S. EPA to stop burning coal at our remaining Cholla units by the mid-2020s • Navajo Generating Station: Plan proposed by a group of stakeholders, including SRP, the operating agent, was approved by the EPA in 2014. The plan will achieve even greater NOx emission reductions than the EPA’s proposal • Participated in Carbon Disclosure Project since 2006 COAL FLEET STRATEGY APS’s proactive approach to reducing emissions leads to coal’s expected share of the energy mix being reduced to 14% 13% 14% 11% 18% 26% 18% 27% 14% 23% 36% 2017 2032 P e r c e n t o f P o r t f o l i o M W h Note: RE = Renewable Energy; DE = Distributed Energy; EE = Energy Efficiency Data shown is based on the Updated 2017 Preliminary Integrated Resource Plan filed September 30, 2016.

Mission: To execute a strategic water resource management program that provides APS timely and reliable information to manage our water resources portfolio efficiently and effectively, and helps ensure long-term water supplies and water contingency plans for each of our facilities, even in times of extended drought. • Each APS power plant has a unique water strategy, developed to promote efficient and sustainable use of water. Water Usage and Intensity: Goal is to maximize use of renewable water resources and minimize use of non-renewable resources. Our 2016 initiatives include: • Reducing consumption of non-renewable water resources by 8% over 2014 levels, and • Reducing water intensity company-wide by 20 percent over 2014 levels Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station: The only nuclear plant in the world that does not sit on a large body of water. Instead, it uses treated effluent, or wastewater, from several area municipalities, recycling approximately 20 billion gallons of wastewater each year
