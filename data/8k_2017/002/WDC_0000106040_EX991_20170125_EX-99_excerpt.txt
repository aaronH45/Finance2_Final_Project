The GAAP net income for the period includes charges associated with the company’s recent acquisitions. Excluding these charges and after other non-GAAP adjustments, second quarter non-GAAP operating income was $995 million and non-GAAP net income was $675 million, or $2.30 per share.

The company generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations during the second fiscal quarter of 2017, ending with approximately $5.2 billion of total cash and cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities. On Nov. 3, 2016, the company declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share of its common stock, which was paid to shareholders on Jan.17, 2017.  

“We reported strong financial performance in the December quarter enabled by excellent operational execution by our team in a favorable market environment,” said Steve Milligan, chief executive officer. “We saw healthy demand for capacity enterprise hard drives, all NAND based products and hard drives in client applications. We also achieved targeted cost and efficiency improvements and improved our liquidity position with continued strong cash flow performance.  

“We continue to execute well on key strategic priorities, including the integration of HGST, SanDisk and WD, and the ramp of 3D NAND technology. We are achieving our planned synergy targets and are progressing with our transition to 3D NAND technology with the ramp of our 64 layer architecture.”

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(in millions, except per share amounts; unaudited)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

To supplement the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the table above sets forth non-GAAP cost of revenue; non-GAAP gross profit; non-GAAP operating expenses; non-GAAP operating income; non-GAAP interest and other expense, net; non-GAAP income tax expense; non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share (“Non-GAAP measures”). These Non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from Non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Western Digital Corporation believes the presentation of these Non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors for measuring the Company’s earnings performance and comparing it against prior periods. Specifically, we believe these Non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors as they exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results or because they are consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow us and our peers. As discussed further below, these Non-GAAP measures exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, employee termination, asset impairment and other charges, acquisition-related charges, charges related to arbitration award, charges related to cost saving initiatives, convertible debt activity, debt extinguishment costs, other charges, and income tax adjustments, and we believe these measures along with the related reconciliations to the GAAP measures provide additional detail and comparability for assessing our results. These Non-GAAP measures are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing our performance and planning and forecasting future periods. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.  

As described above, we exclude the following items from our Non-GAAP measures:  

Amortization of acquired intangible assets. We incur expenses from the amortization of acquired intangible assets over their economic lives. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and any related impairment charges.  

Stock-based compensation expense. Because of the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining stock-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside our control, we believe excluding stock-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of our business over time and compare it against our peers, a majority of whom also exclude stock-based compensation expense from their non-GAAP results.  

Employee termination, asset impairment and other charges. From time-to-time, in order to realign our operations with anticipated market demand or to achieve cost synergies from the integration of acquisitions, we may terminate employees and/or restructure our operations. From time-to-time, we may also incur charges from the impairment of intangible assets and other long-lived assets. These charges (including any reversals of charges recorded in prior periods) are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are not indicative of the underlying performance of our business.  

Acquisition-related charges. In connection with our business combinations, we incur expenses which we would not have otherwise incurred as part of our business operations. These expenses include third-party professional service and legal fees, third-party integration services, severance costs, non-cash adjustments to the fair value of acquired inventory, contract termination costs, and retention bonuses. We may also experience other accounting impacts in connection with these transactions. These charges and impacts are related to acquisitions, are inconsistent in amount and frequency, and are not indicative of the underlying performance of our business.  

Charges related to arbitration award. In relation to an arbitration award for claims brought against the Company by Seagate Technology LLC, which was satisfied in October 2014, and the related dispute over the calculation of post-award interest, we have recorded loss contingencies. The resulting expense is inconsistent in amount and frequency.  

Charges related to cost saving initiatives. In connection with the transformation of our business, we have incurred charges related to cost saving initiatives which do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. These charges, which are not indicative of the underlying performance of our business, primarily relate to costs associated with rationalizing our channel partners or vendors, transforming our information systems infrastructure, integrating our product roadmap, and accelerated depreciation on assets.  

Convertible debt activity, net. We exclude non-cash economic interest expense associated with the convertible senior notes, the gains and losses on the conversion of the convertible senior notes and call option, and unrealized gains and losses related to the change in fair value of the exercise option and call option. These charges and gains and losses do not reflect our cash operating results and are not indicative of the underlying performance of our business.   

Debt extinguishment costs. From time-to-time, we replace our existing debt with new financing at more favorable interest rates or utilize available capital to settle debt early, both of which generate interest savings in future periods. We incur debt extinguishment charges consisting of the costs to call the existing debt and/or the write-off of any related unamortized debt issuance costs. These gains and losses related to our debt activity occur infrequently and are not indicative of the underlying performance of our business.  

Other charges. From time-to-time, we sell investments or other assets which are not considered strategic or necessary to our business; are a party to legal or arbitration proceedings, which could result in an expense or benefit due to settlements, final judgments, or accruals for loss contingencies; or incur other charges or gains which are not a part of the ongoing operation of our business. The resulting expense or benefit is inconsistent in amount and frequency.  

Income tax adjustments. Income tax adjustments reflect the difference between income taxes based on a forecasted annual non-GAAP tax rate and a forecasted annual GAAP tax rate as a result of the timing of certain non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments.
