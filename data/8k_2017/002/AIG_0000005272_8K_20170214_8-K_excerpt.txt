(“AIG”), and National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”), entered into an Aggregate Excess of Loss Reinsurance Agreement (the “Reinsurance Agreement”) pursuant to which the AIG Insurers reinsured certain long-tail commercial lines liabilities with NICO.
