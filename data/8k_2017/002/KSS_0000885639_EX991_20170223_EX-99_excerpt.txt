Kevin Mansell, Kohl's chairman, chief executive officer and president, said, “Sales results were weak for the quarter in total, driven by declines in brick and mortar traffic, and offset somewhat by strength in online demand.

We will also extend our efforts on improving our speed to market across all of our proprietary brands into all apparel areas and home.”
