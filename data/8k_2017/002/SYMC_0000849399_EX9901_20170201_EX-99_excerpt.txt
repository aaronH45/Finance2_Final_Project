USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION: Our results of operations have undergone significant change due to the impact of purchase accounting on revenue and cost of revenue on Blue Coat products, certain acquisition and integration costs, discontinued operations, stock-based compensation, restructuring, transition and separation matters, charges related to the amortization of intangible assets, and certain other income and expense items that management considers unrelated to the Company’s core operations. To help our readers understand our past financial performance and our future results, we supplement the financial results that we provide in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures including constant currency information. The method we use to produce non-GAAP results is not computed according to GAAP and may differ from the methods used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Symantec’s operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results, which is attached to our quarterly earnings release and which can be found, along with other financial information, on the investor relations page of our website at: http://www.symantec.com/invest.

SYMANTEC CORPORATION

 Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures

 Appendix A 

Objective of non-GAAP measures: We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operating performance for the reasons discussed below. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of our performance to prior periods and to our peers and that investors benefit from an understanding of the non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. 

Discontinued operations: In August 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the assets of our information management business (“Veritas”) to Carlyle. In January 2016, we and Carlyle amended the terms of the purchase agreement for Carlyle's acquisition of Veritas. The transaction closed on January 29, 2016. The results of Veritas are presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and thus have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all reported periods. Furthermore, Veritas' assets and liabilities were removed from our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of April 1, 2016, and have been classified as discontinued operations on our Consolidated Balance Sheet for all prior periods. 

Deferred revenue fair value adjustment: We define non-GAAP net revenues as net revenues excluding the impact of purchase accounting. We regularly monitor these measures to assess its operating performance. On August 1, 2016, in connection with the Symantec acquisition of Blue Coat, Inc. (“Blue Coat”), and on May 22, 2015, as part of the Bain Capital Investors, LLC (“Bain”) acquisition of Blue Coat, the deferred revenue balances from Blue Coat products were required to be written down due to purchase accounting in accordance with GAAP. The impact on revenues related to purchase accounting as a result of these transactions, particularly as a result of the Symantec acquisition of Blue Coat, limits the comparability of revenues between periods. While the deferred revenue written down in connection with the acquisitions will never be recognized as revenues under GAAP, we do not expect the Symantec or Bain acquisition of Blue Coat to have an impact on future renewal rates of the contracts included within the deferred revenue write-down, nor do we expect revenues generated from new service and subscription contracts to be similarly impacted by purchase accounting adjustments. Accordingly, we believe presenting non-GAAP net revenues to exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, including the deferred revenue write-down, aids in the comparability between periods and in assessing our overall operating performance. Without these adjustments, it would be difficult for investors to assess our financial performance and trends. Non-GAAP net revenues has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net revenues. Other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently, which may limit its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

Inventory fair value adjustment: Purchase accounting requires us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. The fair value of inventory reflects the acquired company’s cost of manufacturing plus a portion of the expected profit margin. The non-GAAP adjustments to our cost of revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 exclude the expected profit margin component that is recorded under purchase accounting associated with our acquisition of Blue Coat. We believe the adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect cost of revenues and gross margin trends of our business. 

Stock-based compensation: This consists of expenses for employee stock options, restricted stock units, performance based awards and our employee stock purchase plan determined in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock-based compensation. When evaluating the performance of our individual business units and developing short- and long-term strategic plans, we do not consider stock-based compensation charges. Our management team is held accountable for cash-based compensation, but not for stock-based compensation expenses as we believe that management is limited in its ability to project the impact of stock-based compensation would have on our operating results. In addition, for comparability purposes, we believe it is useful to provide a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate the comparison of our results to the results of our peer companies. The following table sets forth our stock-based compensation expenses for the reported periods: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Amortization of intangible assets: When conducting internal development of intangible assets, accounting rules require that we expense the costs as incurred. In the case of acquired businesses, however, we are required to allocate a portion of the purchase price to the accounting value assigned to intangible assets acquired and amortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets. The acquired company, in most cases, has itself previously expensed the costs incurred to develop the acquired intangible assets, and the purchase price allocated to these assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost we would incur in developing the intangible asset. We eliminate these amortization charges from our non-GAAP operating results to provide better comparability of pre- and post-acquisition operating results and comparability to results of businesses utilizing internally developed intangible assets. 

Acquisition and integration costs: These represent the transaction and integration costs associated with the Blue Coat acquisition and transaction costs from the expected LifeLock, Inc. acquisition. These costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect these business combinations. Acquisition costs include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Integration costs include expenses incurred following acquisitions that are directly related to integration of business and facility operations, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs. We exclude the transaction and integration expenses as they are related to acquisitions and thus have no direct correlation to the operation of our business, and because we believe that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding these costs provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and liquidity. In addition, excluding these costs from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to peer company operating results.

 Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures

 Appendix A (continued) 

Restructuring, separation, transition and other: We have engaged in various restructuring, separation, transition, and other activities over the past several years that have resulted in costs associated with severance, facilities, transition, and other related costs. Separation and associated costs consist of consulting and disentanglement costs incurred to separate our security and information management businesses into standalone companies, as well as costs to prune selected product lines that do not fit either our growth or margin objectives. Transition and associated costs primarily consist of consulting charges associated with the implementation of new enterprise resource planning systems and costs to automate business processes. Additionally, other costs primarily consist of asset write-offs and advisory fees incurred in connection with restructuring events. Each restructuring, separation, transition, and other activity has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. We do not engage in restructuring, separation, transition, or other activities in the ordinary course of business. While our operations previously benefited from the employees and facilities covered by our various restructuring and separation charges, these employees and facilities have benefited different parts of our business in different ways, and the amount of these charges has varied significantly from period to period. We believe that it is important to understand these charges and that investors benefit from the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures excluding these charges to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. 

Non-cash interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs: In accordance with GAAP, we separately account for the value of the conversion feature on our convertible notes as a debt discount, which is amortized in a manner that reflects our debt borrowing rates. Additionally, we amortize debt issuance costs over the term of the related debt. We exclude the difference between the imputed interest expense, which includes the amortization of the conversion feature and of the issuance costs, and the coupon interest expense, because we believe that excluding these costs provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity, along with enhancing investors’ ability to view the Company’s results from management’s perspective. In addition, we believe excluding these costs from the non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to peer company operating results. 

Income tax effects and adjustments: Our non-GAAP tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was 29%. We use a projected long-term non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim financial reporting periods by eliminating the effects of stock based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and restructuring, separation and transition and other related charges. The long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate also reflects the elimination of the effects of certain discontinued operations accounting policy elections and unique GAAP reporting requirements under discontinued operations as a result of the sale of Veritas. This long-term tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, such as significant changes in the geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activities or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where we operate. We will evaluate and assess the appropriateness of this rate annually, giving due consideration to the impacts of significant events and structural changes in the Company. 

Diluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding: Diluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding are the same except in periods that there is a GAAP loss from continuing operations. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, we do not present dilution for GAAP in periods in which there is a loss from continuing operations. However, if there is non-GAAP net income, we present dilution for non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding in an amount equal to the dilution that would have been presented had there been GAAP income from continuing operations for the period.
