Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to 2015 

Net income attributable to Loews Corporation for the three months ended December 31, 2016 improved compared to the prior year period primarily due to the impact of the reserve charge at CNA and the asset impairment charge at Diamond Offshore in 2015. Absent these charges, net income increased $110 million due to higher earnings at CNA and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP and improved results from the parent company investment portfolio. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings at Diamond Offshore. 

Excluding the reserve charge of $177 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to the long term care business in the fourth quarter of 2015, CNA’s earnings increased due to higher net investment income driven by limited partnership investments and realized investment gains in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to losses in the prior year period. 

Excluding Diamond Offshore’s asset impairment charge of $182 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) in the fourth quarter of 2015, earnings decreased due to a substantial reduction in the number of rigs operating as compared to the year ago period, partially offset by lower depreciation expense resulting mainly from the asset impairment charges incurred in prior periods. 

Boardwalk Pipeline’s earnings were higher due to revenues from new growth projects recently placed in service. 

Income generated by the parent company investment portfolio increased due to higher income from limited partnership investments. 

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to 2015 

Net income attributable to Loews Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased compared to the prior year period primarily due to the impact of the reserve charge at CNA in 2015 and the asset impairment charges at Diamond Offshore, which were lower in 2016 compared to 2015. Absent these charges, net income increased $121 million due to higher earnings at CNA and Boardwalk Pipeline and improved results from the parent company investment portfolio. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings at Diamond Offshore. 

Excluding the reserve charge in 2015, CNA’s earnings increased due to higher net investment income driven by limited partnership investments, higher favorable net prior year reserve development and realized investment gains in 2016 compared to losses in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the current accident year loss ratio and higher underwriting expenses. 

Excluding asset impairment charges in 2015 and 2016, Diamond Offshore’s year-over-year earnings decreased as a result of a substantial reduction in the number of operating rigs, partially offset by revenue earned by newbuild drillships and lower depreciation expense as a result of the asset impairment charges. 

Boardwalk Pipeline’s earnings increased due to growth projects recently placed in service, new rates in effect following the Gulf South rate case, higher parking and lending and storage revenues and the return to service of the Evangeline pipeline. 

Income generated by the parent company investment portfolio improved due to higher income from fixed income and equity securities.
