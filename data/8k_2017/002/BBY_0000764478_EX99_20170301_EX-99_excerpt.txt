“In the fourth quarter, we delivered Enterprise revenue of $13.5 billion, near the midpoint of our guidance range, improved our operating income rate by 80 basis points and delivered significantly higher-than-expected EPS growth. On a full year basis, we delivered the topline performance we outlined at the beginning of the year -- with materially better earnings than originally expected,” said Hubert Joly, Best Buy chairman and CEO.

Joly continued, “Our strong bottom-line performance in the fourth quarter was driven by a disciplined promotional strategy, continued optimization of merchandise margins and strong expense management. Domestically, we continued to gain share across the majority of categories and we believe, in aggregate. This was due to the quality of our assortment, a strong advertising and promotional cadence, and a superior customer experience across channels. At the same time, our revenue was hindered by unprecedented product availability constraints across multiple vendors and categories, only some of which were anticipated. Additionally, there was considerably weaker-than-expected demand in the gaming category. I am proud of what we were able to achieve this quarter and want to thank all of our associates for their hard work, dedication and customer focus.”

Joly continued, “Since the introduction of Renew Blue in November 2012, we have improved the operating performance of the business dramatically. We now feel it is time to call Renew Blue officially over and launch our strategy for the next phase of our journey: Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue.

“In this next phase, we go from turning the company around to shaping our future and creating a company customers and employees love that continues to generate a superior return for our shareholders. We are driven by our purpose to help customers pursue their passions and enrich their lives with the help of technology. Our growth strategy is centered around three pillars, which are to (1) maximize the multi-channel retail business; (2) provide services and solutions that solve real customer needs; and (3) accelerate growth in Canada and Mexico. Fiscal 2018 is our first step in Building the New Blue and we are executing against four priorities: (1) explore and pursue growth opportunities around the pillars; (2) improve execution in key areas; (3) continue to reduce cost and drive efficiencies throughout the business; and (4) build the capabilities necessary to deliver on the first three priorities, which will involve making investments in people and systems,” Joly concluded. 

Best Buy CFO Corie Barry commented, “For fiscal 2018, which is a 53-week year, we are expecting Enterprise revenue growth of approximately 1.5% and an operating income growth rate in the low single digits. On a 52-week basis, we are targeting approximately flat revenue and operating income. 

“Our annual outlook is influenced by a number of factors, including expected share gains and the positive impact from our new initiatives, offset by our assumption that the industry growth will remain negative, similar to the last two years, and product availability issues will continue, particularly in the first half of the year. We are also expecting our investments and ongoing pressures in the business, including approximately $60 million of lower profit share revenue, to be offset by a combination of returns from new initiatives and ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and return excess cash to shareholders. Today we announced a 21% increase in our dividend and a share repurchase plan that accelerates from $1 billion over two years to $3 billion over two years.” 

Barry concluded, “Of course, our quarterly performance can fluctuate based on a number of factors including product cycles, inventory availability and industry dynamics. Our Q1 FY18 guidance reflects the softness we have seen reported so far this quarter in the NPD-tracked categories and continued softness in the mobile phone category due both to last year’s product recall and the assumption that new phone launches will occur later in the quarter than they did last year.”

Domestic Segment Fourth Quarter Results

Domestic Revenue

Domestic revenue of $12.3 billion decreased 1.4% versus last year driven by a comparable sales decline of 0.9% and the loss of revenue from 11 large format and 31 Best Buy Mobile store closures. Industry revenue in the NPD-tracked categories declined 2.8%.2 

From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in connected home, computing, headphones and home theater was more than offset by declines in gaming, tablets, health & wearables and mobile phones.

Domestic online revenue of $2.3 billion increased 17.5% on a comparable basis primarily due to increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 300 basis points to 18.6% versus 15.6% last year.

Domestic Gross Profit Rate

Domestic GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit rate was 22.3% versus 21.6% last year. The 70-basis point increase was primarily due to improved margin rates in the computing and home theater categories and the positive impact of decreased sales in the lower-margin categories of gaming and wearables. These rate increases were partially offset by margin pressure in the mobile category and approximately $30 million, or 20 basis points, of net negative impact due to lapping the periodic profit sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio.3 

Domestic Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”)

Domestic SG&A expenses were $1.94 billion, or 15.7% of revenue, versus $1.98 billion, or 15.8% of revenue, last year. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses were $1.93 billion, or 15.6% of revenue, versus $1.95 billion, or 15.6% of revenue, last year. For both GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A, the decrease was primarily driven by lower variable costs as a result of decreased year-over-year revenue.

International Segment Fourth Quarter Results

International Revenue 

International revenue of $1.14 billion increased 2.5% driven primarily by (1) comparable sales growth of 0.9% primarily from our business in Mexico; (2) an approximately 90-basis point periodic profit sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio;3 and (3) approximately 70 basis points of positive foreign currency impact. 

International Gross Profit Rate

International gross profit rate was 24.6% versus 22.1% last year. On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit rate was 24.6% versus 21.8% last year. For both the GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit rate, the increase was primarily driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to (1) improved margin rates in the computing and home theater categories; (2) an approximately $10 million, or 65-basis point, periodic profit sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio;3 and (3) decreased sales in the lower-margin gaming category. 

International SG&A

International GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $200 million, or 17.5% of revenue, versus $192 million, or 17.2% of revenue, last year. For both GAAP and non-GAAP SG&A, the increase was primarily driven by slightly higher payroll and benefits and advertising costs.

Share Repurchases and Dividends

During Q4 FY17, the company returned a total of $314 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. On a year-to-date basis, the company has returned a total of $1.25 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 

On February 25, 2016, the company announced the intent to repurchase $1 billion of its shares over a two-year period. In Q4 FY17, the company repurchased 5.3 million shares for a total of $226 million. For fiscal 2017, the company repurchased 21.0 million shares for a total of $743 million. The company’s cumulative share repurchases, net of dilution from equity based awards, positively benefitted GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.14 in Q4 FY17.

On December 29, 2016, the company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per common share outstanding, or $88 million. For fiscal 2017, the company paid $502 million in regular and special dividends.

Conference Call

Best Buy is scheduled to conduct an earnings conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time (7:00 a.m. Central Time) on March 1, 2017. A webcast of the call is expected to be available at www.investors.bestbuy.com both live and after the call.

(1) On March 28, 2015, the company consolidated the Future Shop and Best Buy stores and websites in Canada under the Best Buy brand. This resulted in the permanent closure of 66 Future Shop stores, the conversion of 65 Future Shop stores to Best Buy stores and the elimination of the Future Shop website. The Canadian brand consolidation had a material impact on a year-over-year basis on the Canadian retail stores and the website and as such, all store and website revenue was removed from the comparable sales base and International (comprised of Canada and Mexico) no longer had a comparable metric through Q3 FY17. From Q1 FY16 through Q3 FY17 Enterprise comparable sales were equal to Domestic comparable sales. 

Beginning in Q4 FY17, the company resumed reporting International comparable sales as revenue in the International segment was once again deemed to be comparable and, as such, Enterprise comparable sales are once again equal to the aggregation of Domestic and International comparable sales. However, the company is not providing International comparable sales for the full year FY17 as the calculation would only include comparable revenue from Q4 FY17 and may be misleading in future periods when used for comparison purposes. 

Additionally, the company is no longer reporting comparable sales excluding the impact of installment billing as the mix of installment billing plans is comparable on a year-over-year basis. 

(2) According to The NPD Group’s Weekly Retail Tracking Service as published February 6, 2017, revenue for the CE (Consumer Electronics) industry declined 2.8% during the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2017 compared to the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2016. The categories tracked by The NPD Group include TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets, digital imaging and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of Domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, appliances, services, gaming, Apple Watch, movies, music or Amazon-branded products. 

(3) In Q4 FY17, the Domestic business recorded a periodic profit sharing benefit from its services plan portfolio of $74 million in revenue and gross profit versus a Q4 FY16 benefit of $106 million. The International business recorded a Q4 FY17 benefit to revenue and gross profit of $10 million versus no benefit in Q4 FY16.

(4) A reconciliation of the projected non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS, which are forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, is not provided because the company is unable to provide such reconciliation without unreasonable effort. The inability to provide a reconciliation is due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty predicting the occurrence, the financial impact and the periods in which the non-GAAP adjustments may be recognized. These GAAP measures may include the impact of such items as restructuring charges; litigation settlements; asset impairments, gains and losses; and the tax effect of all such items. Historically, the company has excluded these items from non-GAAP financial measures. The company currently expects to continue to exclude these items in future disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures and may also exclude other items that may arise (collectively, “non-GAAP adjustments”). The decisions and events that typically lead to the recognition of non-GAAP adjustments, such as a decision to exit part of the business, the early retirement of an asset or reaching settlement of a legal dispute, are inherently unpredictable as to if or when they may occur. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

CONTINUING OPERATIONS

($ in millions, except per share amounts)

(Unaudited and subject to reclassification)

The following information provides reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures from continuing operations calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) to presented non-GAAP financial measures. The company believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance. For these reasons, internal management reporting also includes non-GAAP measures. Generally, presented non-GAAP measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill impairments, non-restructuring asset impairments and gains or losses on investments. In addition, certain other items may be excluded from non-GAAP financial measures when the company believes this provides greater clarity to management and investors. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release and the company’s financial statements and other publicly filed reports. Non-GAAP measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 

The following tables reconcile gross profit, SG&A, operating income, effective tax rate, net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the periods presented for continuing operations (GAAP financial measures) to non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP SG&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for continuing operations (non-GAAP financial measures) for the periods presented.

(1) Represents cathode ray tube ("CRT") and LCD litigation settlements reached, net of related legal fees and costs. Settlements relate to products purchased and sold in prior fiscal years. Refer to Note 12, Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016, for additional information.

(2) Income tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments is the summation of the calculated income tax charge related to each non-GAAP non-income tax adjustment. The non-GAAP adjustments relate primarily to adjustments in the United States and Canada. As such, the income tax charge is calculated using the statutory tax rates of 38.0% for the United States and 26.4% for Canada, applied to the non-GAAP adjustments of each country, which are detailed in the Domestic and International segment reconciliations above, respectively. 

(3) Represents charges related to the Canadian brand consolidation initiated in Q1 FY16, primarily due to retention bonuses and other store-related costs that were a direct result of the consolidation but did not qualify as restructuring charges.

Return on Assets and Non-GAAP Return on Invested Capital

The following table includes a reconciliation to the calculation of return on total assets ("ROA") (GAAP financial measure), along with the calculation of non-GAAP return on invested capital (“ROIC”) for total operations, which includes both continuing and discontinued operations (non-GAAP financial measure) for the periods presented.

The company defines non-GAAP ROIC as non-GAAP net operating profit after tax divided by average invested capital using the trailing four-quarter average. The company believes non-GAAP ROIC is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the use of capital and believes non-GAAP ROIC is an important component of shareholders' return over the long term. This method of determining non-GAAP ROIC may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Income statement accounts represent the activity for the trailing 12-months ended as of each of the balance sheet dates. Balance sheet accounts represent the average account balances for the four quarters ended as of each of the balance sheet dates.

(2) Operating lease interest represents the add-back to operating income to properly reflect the total interest expense that the company would incur, if its operating leases were capitalized or owned. The add-back is calculated by multiplying the trailing 12-month total rent expense by 30%. This multiple is used for the retail sector by one of the nationally recognized credit rating agencies that rates the company's credit worthiness, and the company considers it to be an appropriate multiple for its lease portfolio. Historically, the company has used an add-back multiple of 50%; however, due to changes in the average remaining lease life of the company's operating leases, the company has lowered its multiple. The prior period calculations have been updated to reflect the updated multiple.

(3) Includes continuing operations adjustments for net CRT/LCD settlements, restructuring charges, other Canada brand consolidation charges in SG&A and non-restructuring asset impairments in SG&A and a discontinued operations adjustment for a gain on a property sale. Additional details regarding the non-GAAP operating income from continuing operations adjustments are included in the "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" schedule. For additional details on the operating income from discontinued operations adjustment, refer to Note 2, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the company’s Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended October 29, 2016. 

(4)Income taxes are calculated using a blended statutory rate at the Enterprise level based on statutory rates from the countries in which the company does business, which is primarily made up of a 38.0% rate in the United States and a 26.4% rate in Canada.

(5) Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are capped at the greater of 1% of revenue or actual amounts on hand. The cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in excess of the cap are subtracted from the company’s calculation of average invested capital to show their exclusion from total assets.

(6) Capitalized operating lease obligations represent the estimated assets that the company would record, if the company's operating leases were capitalized or owned. The obligation is calculated by multiplying the trailing 12-month total rent expense by the multiple of five. This multiple is used for the retail sector by one of the nationally recognized credit rating agencies that rates the company's credit worthiness, and the company considers it to be an appropriate multiple for its lease portfolio. Historically, the company has used a capitalized lease obligation multiple of eight; however, due to changes in the average remaining lease life of the company's operating leases, the company has lowered its multiples. The prior period calculations have been updated to reflect the updated multiple.

(7)Debt includes short-term debt, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt and is added back to the company’s calculation of average invested capital to show its exclusion from total liabilities.
