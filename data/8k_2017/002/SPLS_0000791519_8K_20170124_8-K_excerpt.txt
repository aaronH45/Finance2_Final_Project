Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or By-laws; Change in Fiscal Year.

On January 24, 2017, the Board of Directors of Staples, Inc. (the “Company”) amended and restated the Company’s by-laws to reduce the percentage of outstanding stock required for stockholders to call a special meeting from 25% to 15%. Article I, Section 2.2 of the amended and restated by-laws permits eligible holders (as defined therein) of at least 15% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the corporation at the time of the request, to call a special meeting of stockholders, subject to the requirements set forth in the amended and restated by-laws. The Board of Directors has adopted these amendments in response to a shareholder proposal that received majority support at the June 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and after carefully considering the perspectives conveyed directly by shareholders as part of ongoing engagement. 

Along with the amendments described above, the Board has also amended Article III, Sections 8.1 and 8.2 to clarify that the Chairperson of the Board position is separate from the position of chief executive officer of the Company, in accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines which generally provide that the Board intends to elect a Chairperson who is an Independent Director whenever possible. The amended and restated by-laws, which were also revised to be gender neutral, are effective immediately. 

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amended and restated by-laws, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

On January 24, 2017, the Company issued a press release announcing the by-law amendments described above. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
