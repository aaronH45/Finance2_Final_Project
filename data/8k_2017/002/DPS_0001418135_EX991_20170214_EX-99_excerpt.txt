Plano, TX, February 14, 2017 - Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (NYSE: DPS) reported fourth quarter 2016 EPS of $0.90, which included an $0.11 per diluted share loss on the early extinguishment of certain debt. Reported EPS were $0.97 in the prior year period. Core EPS were $1.04, up 4%, compared to $1.00 in the prior year period. For the year, the company reported earnings of $4.54 per diluted share compared to $3.97 per diluted share in the prior year. Core EPS were $4.39, up 9%, compared to $4.02 in the prior year.

DPS President and CEO Larry Young said, “I’m proud of our teams and the strong performance they delivered in 2016. In a continuously competitive environment, we remained focused on our integrated communication and execution strategies and unlocked growth across our priority brands. We recently completed our acquisition of Bai, which will strengthen our priority brand portfolio and bring exciting innovation opportunities to the company. We also remained relentlessly focused on driving growth and productivity across our business with Rapid Continuous Improvement.” 

For the quarter, reported net sales increased 2% on favorable product and package mix, a 1% increase in sales volumes and higher pricing. Net sales was partially offset by 1 percentage point of unfavorable foreign currency translation and unfavorable segment mix. Reported segment operating profit (SOP) increased 2% as net sales growth, lower logistics costs and ongoing productivity improvements were partially offset by increases in certain operating costs and an $8 million increase in planned marketing investments. Currency neutral segment operating profit was further reduced by 2 percentage points of foreign currency transaction. 

Reported income from operations for the quarter was $335 million, which included $11 million in unrealized commodity mark-to-market gains and $3 million in expenses related to our acquisition of Bai. Reported income from operations was $322 million in the prior year period, which included a $7 million impairment charge on the Garden Cocktail brand.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Beverage Concentrates

Net sales increased 4% in the quarter driven by concentrate price increases taken earlier in the year, favorable product mix, lower discounts and a 1% increase in concentrate shipments. SOP increased 7%, as the increase in net sales was partially offset by a $1 million increase in planned marketing investments.

Packaged Beverages

Net sales increased 3% for the quarter on favorable product and package mix and price increases. SOP decreased 3% as net sales growth, favorable logistics costs and ongoing productivity improvements were more than offset by increases in certain operating expenses, including $4 million of health and welfare and insurance costs and additional frontline labor costs focused on driving better execution. SOP was further reduced by an $8 million increase in planned marketing investments, which reduced SOP by 4 percentage points. 

Latin America Beverages

Net sales increased 6% in the quarter driven by a 5% increase in sales volumes, favorable product and package mix and higher net pricing. SOP was flat, as the segment incurred $8 million of higher U.S. dollar denominated input costs which caused a 40% decline in SOP. The aforementioned foreign currency transaction cost taken together with increases in certain other operating expenses collectively offset net sales growth and ongoing productivity improvements.

Corporate and Other Items

For the quarter, corporate costs totaled $73 million, which included $11 million in unrealized commodity mark-to-market gains, $3 million in acquisition costs related to Bai and an increase in American Beverage Association expenses due to timing. Corporate costs in the prior year period were $75 million.

Other expense decreased $4 million in the quarter on the favorable comparison of a prior year impairment charge of $7 million on the Garden Cocktail brand.

4

Net interest expense increased $14 million in the quarter driven by $12 million of mark-to-market activity related to certain interest rate swaps and amortization expense associated with a bridge facility related to our acquisition of Bai.

For the quarter, the reported effective tax rate was 35.4%. The effective tax rate in the prior year period was 36.4%.

Cash Flow

For the year, the company generated $939 million of cash from operating activities compared to $991 million in the prior year. Capital spending totaled $180 million compared to $179 million in the prior year period. The company returned $905 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases ($519 million) and dividends ($386 million).

2017 Full Year Guidance includes the following items:

•Organic volume growth of approximately 1%; total volume growth of close to 2%, inclusive of the Bai acquisition, which closed on January 31, 2017. 

•Net sales growth of about 4.5%, including over 1 percentage point of negative foreign currency translation impact and also includes the Bai acquisition, which is expected to add approximately 3 percentage points to growth.

•Expected net sales and operating profit associated with the Bai acquisition are now expected to be better than previously communicated in November of 2016, however non-cash purchase price accounting adjustments are expected make the acquisition $0.10 dilutive to Core EPS for the year. 

•Collectively, foreign currency translation and transaction are expected to reduce Core EPS by $0.11, primarily driven by the Mexican peso, which we believe may deteriorate an additional 14% from the 2016 year-ended level.  

•Recent events affecting Mexico have created an uncertain economic and consumer environment leading us to reduce our 2017 Core EPS expectation by $0.04. 

•Excluding the Bai acquisition, packaging and ingredient costs are expected to be inflationary by approximately 0.5% on a constant volume/mix basis. 

•The company expects its core tax rate to be approximately 34.5%, inclusive of a favorable accounting change associated with stock compensation expense that is expected to increase Core EPS by about $0.07.

•The company expects strong free cash flow, capable of funding both a 9.4% dividend increase and repurchases of its common stock of $450 million to $500 million. 

•The company expects capital spending to be approximately 3 percent of net sales. 

•Taking the above items into consideration, the company expects 2017 Core EPS in the $4.44 to $4.54 range.
