 Ingersoll Rand Reports Fourth-Quarter and Record Annual 2016 Results

Highlights (versus prior year, unless otherwise noted):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Swords, Ireland, February 1, 2017 - Ingersoll-Rand plc (NYSE:IR), a world leader in creating comfortable, sustainable and efficient environments, today reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $0.76 for the fourth quarter of 2016. The company reported net earnings of $198.8 million, or EPS of $0.75, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding tax adjusted restructuring costs and a legal settlement related to a contract that predates the acquisition of Trane, adjusted continuing EPS was $0.84. 

“Fourth-quarter business segment operating performance was strong and the core business remains very healthy,” said Michael W. Lamach, chairman and chief executive officer. “Organic bookings were up more than 7 percent and organic revenues were up 2 percent with excellent full-year free cash flow of 121 percent of adjusted net income. Our Climate segment met our already high internal expectations with fourth-quarter bookings up 9 percent and revenues up 3 percent, while operating margins expanded 70 basis points. Our Industrial segment continued to make solid, steady progress, with fourth-quarter performance above our initial expectations. We fell short of our guidance range due to a number of negative items in the fourth quarter that, together, drove our results below our guidance. These items included higher-than-expected corporate costs, and a higher-than-forecast tax rate in the quarter.”

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The Industrial Segment executed ahead of expectations in Q4, meeting FY reported and organic revenue and margin guidance.

•The company continues to maintain focus on cost reductions and new products, while driving mix to services as seen from the continued Y-O-Y growth in aftermarket throughout 2016. 

•Regionally, organic revenues declined by low-single digits in North America and low-teens in EMEA. This was partially offset by growth in Asia and Latin America.

•Compression Technologies organic revenues were down low-single digits. Equipment was down mid-single digits, with aftermarket organic revenues up low-single digits. Organic bookings were down low-single digits. Organic equipment bookings were down high-single digits. However, aftermarket organic bookings were up mid-single digits partly offsetting the decline in equipment. 

•Industrial Products organic revenues were down high-single digits, driven by a continued sharp decline in material handling. Organic bookings were down low-single digits, with positive growth in the short cycle Power Tools and Fluid Management businesses.

•Small electric vehicle (Club Car) organic revenues were up slightly, with organic bookings up low-single digits year-over-year.

*Non-GAAP measures definitions

Organic revenue is defined as GAAP net revenues adjusted for the impact of currency and acquisitions. Organic bookings is defined as reported orders closed/completed in the current period adjusted for the impact of currency and acquisitions. 

•Currency impacts on net revenues and bookings are measured by applying the prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates to the current period’s net revenues and bookings reported in local currency. This measure allows for a direct comparison of operating results excluding the year-over-year impact of foreign currency translation.

•Acquisition growth rate impacts from 2015 versus 2014 for both net revenues and orders are calculated by excluding the net revenues and orders from companies acquired in 2015. We are adjusting the 2015 to 2014 growth rate comparisons for the Engineered Centrifugal Compression business acquired in January 2015 and reported in our Industrial segment, and the Frigoblock acquisition completed in March 2015 and reported in our Climate segment, to allow for a direct comparison of operating results to prior periods.

Adjusted operating margin is defined as the ratio of adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.

•Adjusted operating income is defined as GAAP operating income plus restructuring expenses in 2016. In 2015 acquisition-related inventory step-up costs were also excluded from this measure. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures on tables 3 and 4 of the news release.

In 2016 Adjusted EPS is defined as GAAP EPS plus restructuring expenses and a legal settlement, less the gain recognized on the sale of the Hussmann equity interest in Q2 2016, net of tax impacts. In 2015 Adjusted EPS was defined as GAAP EPS plus restructuring expenses, acquisition-related inventory step-up costs, Venezuela re-measurement of monetary assets and the IRS agreement, net of tax impacts. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures on tables 3 and 4 of the news release.

•Legal Settlement of a lawsuit originally filed by a customer in 2012. The lawsuit related to a commercial HVAC contract entered into in 2001, prior to our acquisition of Trane U.S. Inc. and the charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 represents the settlement and related legal costs.

Free cash flow in 2016 and 2015 is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus cash payments for restructuring. In 2015 this definition also excluded the cash impact of the IRS agreement which occurred in the third and fourth quarters. Please refer to the free cash flow reconciliation on table 8 of the news release. 

Cash flow return on invested capital is defined as annual free cash flow divided by the sum of gross fixed assets, receivables and inventory less accounts payables. 

Working Capital measures a firm’s operating liquidity position and its overall effectiveness in managing the enterprises’ current accounts. 

•Working capital is calculated by adding net accounts and notes receivables and inventories and subtracting total current liabilities that exclude short term debt, dividend payables and income tax payables. 

•Working capital as a percent of revenue is calculated by dividing the working capital balance (e.g. as of December 31) by the annualized revenue for the period (e.g. reported revenues for the three months ended December 31) multiplied by 4 to annualize for a full year).

Adjusted effective tax rate for Q4 2016 is defined as the ratio of income tax expense, plus or minus the tax effect of adjustments for restructuring costs and a legal settlement, divided by earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus restructuring expenses and legal settlement. Q4 2015 adjustments were comprised of restructuring costs and acquisition-related inventory step-up charges. This measure allows for a direct comparison of the effective tax rate between periods excluding adjustments.

Adjusted OI and D&A (on tables 5 and 6 in news release) is defined as adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization expense. 

Operating leverage is defined as the ratio of the change in adjusted operating income for the current period (e.g. Q4 2016) less the prior period (e.g. Q4 2015), divided by the change in net revenues for the current period less the prior period.
