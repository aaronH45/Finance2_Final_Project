Ameren Announces 2016 Results 

and Issues 2017 Earnings Guidance

•2016 GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share were $2.68, Compared to $2.59 in 2015

•2016 Core (Non-GAAP) Diluted EPS were $2.68, Compared to $2.56 in 2015

•2017 Diluted EPS Guidance Range Established at $2.65 to $2.85

ST. LOUIS (Feb. 16, 2017) — Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced 2016 net income attributable to common shareholders in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $653 million, or $2.68 per diluted share, compared to $630 million, or $2.59 per diluted share, for 2015. The 2015 GAAP earnings included results from discontinued operations and a loss provision for discontinuing the pursuit of a construction and operating license (COL) for a second nuclear unit at Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center. Excluding these two items, Ameren recorded 2015 core earnings of $622 million, or $2.56 per diluted share.

The year-over-year increase in 2016 earnings reflected increased 2016 electric transmission and distribution infrastructure investments made by Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois (ATXI) and Ameren Illinois under modern, constructive regulatory frameworks. Earnings in 2016 also benefited from higher summer 2016 electric sales to residential and commercial customers driven by warmer temperatures, as well as higher Illinois natural gas distribution rates and 2016 tax impacts associated with share-based compensation. These positive factors were partially offset by lower electric sales to the New Madrid aluminum smelter, the unfavorable comparative impact of the 2015 Missouri energy efficiency plan and 2016 nuclear refueling and maintenance outage expenses at the Callaway Energy Center compared to no such outage in 2015. 

"In 2016, we again delivered solid earnings growth," said Warner L. Baxter, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. “Our team continued to successfully execute all elements of our strategy, including allocating capital to jurisdictions with modern, constructive regulatory frameworks, enhancing existing regulatory frameworks in Illinois and managing costs in a disciplined manner."

Ameren recorded GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2016, of $32 million, or 13 cents per diluted share, compared to $29 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, for the same period in 2015. The GAAP results for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2015, included a $1 million loss from

discontinued operations. The year-over-year increase in fourth quarter 2016 earnings reflected higher retail electric and gas sales to residential and commercial customers due to near-normal winter temperatures compared to mild temperatures in the fourth quarter of 2015. Earnings in 2016 also reflected increased electric transmission infrastructure investments made by ATXI and Ameren Illinois, as well as a lower effective income tax rate. These factors were partially offset by the unfavorable comparative impact of the 2015 Missouri energy efficiency plan and lower electric sales to the New Madrid smelter. 

As reflected in the table below, the following items were excluded from core earnings for the year ended Dec. 31, 2015:

•Results from discontinued operations, which increased 2015 GAAP net income by $51 million, primarily due to recognition of a tax benefit related to the resolution of an uncertain tax position. 

•A provision for discontinuing pursuit of a COL for a second nuclear unit at Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center, which decreased 2015 net income from continuing operations by $43 million.

A reconciliation of full-year GAAP to core earnings in millions of dollars and per share, is as follows:

Earnings Guidance

Ameren expects 2017 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.65 to $2.85 and continues to expect diluted earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, driven by projected rate base growth and based on the adjusted 2016 earnings per share guidance midpoint of $2.63 provided in February 2016. Ameren also expects projected rate base growth of 6% compounded annually from 2016 through 2021. 

"Looking ahead, we plan to continue to deliver solid long-term earnings per share growth compared to our peers reflecting a robust pipeline of investments in critical energy infrastructure that will deliver long-term benefits to our customers and the communities we serve," Baxter said. "In addition, we will maintain our strong financial discipline by allocating more capital to those jurisdictions with modern, constructive frameworks and will continue to actively engage with policymakers and key stakeholders to implement energy and economic policies that will deliver long-term benefits to our customers and shareholders."

Earnings guidance for 2017 assumes normal temperatures and, along with Ameren's growth expectations, is subject to the effects of, among other things: 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields; regulatory, judicial and legislative actions; energy center and energy distribution operations; energy, economic, capital and credit market conditions; severe storms; unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses; and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release.

Ameren Reportable Segments

Effective with the fourth quarter of 2016, Ameren now has four reportable segments: Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas and Ameren Transmission. The Ameren Missouri segment includes all of the operations of Ameren Missouri. The Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution segment consists of the electric distribution business of Ameren Illinois. The Ameren Illinois Natural Gas segment consists of the natural gas distribution business of Ameren Illinois. The Ameren Transmission segment is composed of the electric transmission businesses of Ameren Illinois and ATXI. The Other category includes all activities not included in the four reportable segments.

Ameren Missouri Segment Results

Ameren Missouri segment 2016 GAAP and core earnings were $357 million, compared to 2015 GAAP and core earnings of $352 million and $395 million, respectively. GAAP earnings in 2015 included the provision for the Callaway COL, but this item was excluded from core earnings. The decrease in year-over-year core earnings reflected lower electric sales to the New Madrid smelter, the unfavorable comparative impact of the 2015 energy efficiency plan, 2016 nuclear refueling and maintenance outage expenses at the Callaway Energy Center compared to no such outage in 2015, as well as higher depreciation expense. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by higher 2016 electric sales to residential and commercial customers primarily driven by warmer summer temperatures, as well as lower other operations and maintenance and financing expenses. 

Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution Segment Results

Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution segment 2016 earnings were $126 million, compared to 2015 earnings of $123 million. The year-over-year earnings improvement reflected increased infrastructure investments, as well as higher electric sales driven by warmer summer temperatures. These positive factors were partially offset by a reduced allowed return on equity due to lower 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields and by the absence in 2016 of an Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) order approving recovery of cumulative power usage costs in 2015. 

Ameren Illinois Natural Gas Segment Results

Ameren Illinois Natural Gas segment 2016 earnings were $59 million, compared to 2015 earnings of $37 million. The year-over-year earnings improvement reflected higher natural gas distribution rates authorized in a December 2015 ICC order, which incorporated 2016 energy infrastructure investments and a higher allowed return on equity.

Ameren Transmission Segment Results

Ameren Transmission segment 2016 earnings were $117 million, compared to 2015 earnings of $83 million. The year-over-year earnings improvement reflected increased infrastructure investments and a higher average allowed return on equity. 

Other Results from Continuing Operations

Results for the Other category for 2016 were a loss of $6 million, compared to a loss of $16 million for 2015. This reduced year-over-year loss reflected a decrease in the effective income tax rate, which was primarily due to the recognition of 2016 tax benefits of $21 million associated with share-based compensation. This positive factor was partially offset by increased parent company interest charges resulting from the November 2015 issuance of $700 million of senior notes that replaced lower-cost, short-term debt.

Ameren will conduct a conference call for financial analysts at 9 a.m. Central Time on Thursday, Feb. 16, to discuss 2016 earnings, earnings guidance and growth expectations, and regulatory and other matters. Investors, the news media and the public may listen to a live Internet broadcast of the call at Amereninvestors.com by clicking on the Q4 2016 "Webcast," where an accompanying slide presentation will also be available.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In this release, Ameren has presented core earnings, which is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results has been included in this release. Generally, core earnings or losses include earnings or losses attributable to Ameren common shareholders and exclude income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as the Callaway COL provision. Ameren uses core earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core earnings as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the company believes that core earnings allow the company to more accurately compare its ongoing performance across periods. In providing core earnings guidance, there could be differences between core earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP as a result of our treatment of certain items, such as those described above. Ameren is unable to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of such items.
