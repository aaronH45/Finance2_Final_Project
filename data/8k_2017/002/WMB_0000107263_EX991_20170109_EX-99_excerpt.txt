   ○    Williams Partners’ quarterly distribution for the quarter ending March 31, 2017 expected to be reduced to $0.60 per unit ($2.40 per unit on an annualized basis), representing a 29% reduction to the current payout, and targeting 5-7% annual growth over the next several years, with expected cash distribution coverage ratio of 1.2x or more in 2017, and maintenance of strong coverage in excess of 1.1x thereafter  

   ○    Williams’ quarterly dividend to be paid in March 2017 expected to be increased to $0.30 per share ($1.20 on an annualized basis), representing a 50% increase to the current payout, and targeting 10-15% annual growth over the next several years, with expected dividend coverage ratio of 1.3x in 2017 and coverage in excess of 1.1x thereafter; excess coverage will be used to reduce holding company debt over time

   ○    In addition to the previously announced Geismar monetization process, we have identified other select assets that do not support the company’s clear strategy, ensuring focus on those assets that are core to Williams’ operations and growth  

   •   For WPZ, this series of transactions will improve its cost of capital, remove its need to access the public equity markets for the next several years, enhance growth, and provide for immediate deleveraging  

   •   This series of transactions solidifies WPZ as an attractive financing vehicle, facilitates a reduction of Williams’ consolidated debt using excess coverage and provides for dividend growth flexibility, while retaining the strategic and financing flexibility afforded by a dual-C-corp/MLP business model  

   •   Williams plans to host an investor conference call today at 3:10PM CT (4:10PM ET)

TULSA, Okla. January 9, 2017 – Williams (NYSE: WMB, “Williams”) and Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE: WPZ, “Williams Partners”) today announced an agreement to permanently waive payment obligations under the incentive distribution rights held by Williams and convert Williams’ economic general partner interest into a non-economic interest for 289 million newly issued Williams Partners common units (collectively, the “IDR Waiver”). The estimated transaction value is approximately $11.4 billion. Following the IDR Waiver, Williams will hold approximately 660 million Williams Partners common units, representing approximately 72% of the common units outstanding.  

Williams also announced that it expects to purchase newly issued common units of Williams Partners at a price of $36.08586 per unit (the “Unit Private Placement”, and together with the funding with Williams equity and the IDR Waiver, the “Transactions”). Williams expects to fund the unit purchase with equity. With respect to units issued to Williams in the private placement, Williams Partners will not be required to pay distributions for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 and the prorated portion of the first quarter of 2017 up to closing of the private placement. Williams expects to discontinue participation in Williams Partners’ DRIP program, upon successful completion of the Transactions and asset monetizations.  

Alan Armstrong, Williams’ president and chief executive officer, made the following statements regarding the Transactions:  

“Today we announced a comprehensive series of measures to strengthen Williams’ role as North America’s premier natural gas infrastructure company. These actions will deliver immediate and ongoing benefits and position Williams and Williams Partners for long-term, sustainable growth. The improvement of Williams Partners’ cost of capital and simplified organizational structure will better align GP and LP interests as well as solidify Williams Partners’ investment-grade credit ratings. This strong financial position combined with Williams Partners’ high quality, low risk growth portfolio makes Williams a leader amongst peers.”  

Effective with the quarterly distribution for the quarter ending March 31, 2017, Williams Partners expects to pay a quarterly distribution of $0.60 ($2.40 per unit on an annualized basis), a reduction of approximately 29% from Williams Partners’ expected fourth quarter 2016 distribution of $0.85 per common unit ($3.40 per unit on an annualized basis). Williams Partners expects distribution growth of 5-7% annually over the next several years. Future quarterly distributions are subject to quarterly approval by Williams Partners’ board of directors.  

Williams announced that effective with the quarterly dividend to be paid in March 2017, Williams expects to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share ($1.20 per share on an annualized basis), an increase of 50% above Williams’ dividend paid in December 2016 of $0.20 per share ($0.80 per share on an annualized basis). Williams expects dividend per share growth of 10-15% annually over the next several years. Future quarterly dividend payments are subject to quarterly approval by Williams’ board of directors.  

As a result of the measures announced today, Williams expects that Williams Partners will not be required to access the public equity markets for the next several years. In addition, the Transactions result in debt reduction at Williams Partners and a meaningful increase in its cash coverage ratio to approximately 1.2x in 2017 and maintenance of strong coverage in excess of 1.1x thereafter.  

Dividend coverage ratio at Williams will be approximately 1.3x in 2017, with continued coverage in excess of 1.1x thereafter. Excess cash at Williams after dividend payments will be used to reduce leverage over time.  

Strengthening Williams Partners’ coverage and credit profile through the Transactions will benefit stakeholders in Williams Partners, including Williams. In addition, maintaining Williams Partners as a strong, separate entity provides on-going strategic and financial flexibility to Williams, enabling it to capitalize on future opportunities to grow both organically and inorganically.  

As part of Williams’ ongoing commitment to maximize returns on capital deployed, Williams today announced that, in addition to the previously announced Geismar monetization process, Williams has identified other select assets that do not support the company’s clear strategy, ensuring focus on those assets and regions that are core to Williams’ operations and growth. Williams expects to raise more than $2.0 billion in after-tax proceeds, inclusive of the ongoing Geismar monetization process.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures  

This news release may include certain financial measures – adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, adjusted income (“earnings”), adjusted earnings per share, cash available for dividends, dividend coverage ratio and cash distribution coverage ratio – that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

Our segment performance measure, modified EBITDA, is defined as net income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of modified EBITDA of equity-method investments.  

Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and may include assumed business interruption insurance related to the Geismar plant. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into results from ongoing operations.  

Cash available for dividends and other uses is defined as cash received from our ownership in MLPs, cash received (used) by the Williams NGL & Petchem Services segment (other than cash for capital expenditures) less interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated with Williams and not the underlying MLPs. We also calculate the ratio of cash available for dividends to the total cash dividends paid (dividend coverage ratio). This measure reflects our cash available for dividends relative to actual cash dividends paid.  

We define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures, cash portion of interest expense, income attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ restricted stock unit non-cash compensation expense and certain other adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these items of our equity-method investments.  

We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. We have also provided this ratio using the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss).  

This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Company’s assets and the cash that the business is generating.  

Neither adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, or cash available for dividends and other uses are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
