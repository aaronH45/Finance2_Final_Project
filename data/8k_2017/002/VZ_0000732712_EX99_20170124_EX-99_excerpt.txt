Verizon grows its strong customer base profitably in 4Q  

4Q 2016 highlights  

 •    Consolidated: $1.10 in earnings per share (EPS); adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) of 86 cents, excluding non-operational items related to mark-to-market pension and benefits adjustments and severance-related costs.  

 •    Wireless: 591,000 retail postpaid net additions, including 552,000 new 4G LTE smartphones; retail postpaid churn at 1.10 percent, with strong customer loyalty demonstrated by retail postpaid phone churn of less than 0.90 percent for the seventh consecutive quarter.  

 •    Wireline: 68,000 Fios Internet net additions, 21,000 Fios Video net additions; Fios total revenue growth of 4.4 percent.  

NEW YORK – As Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) continues to transform its business and enter new markets, the company today reported another strong quarter of wireless profitability and customer loyalty, and customer and revenue growth for Fios fiber-optic services.  

Verizon reported fourth-quarter 2016 EPS of $1.10, and full-year EPS of $3.21. Adjusted fourth-quarter 2016 EPS (non-GAAP) of 86 cents excluded 24 cents in net gains related to mark-to-market pension and OPEB (other post-employment benefits) adjustments and severance-related costs. This compares with adjusted fourth-quarter 2015 earnings of 89 cents per share, which primarily excluded pension and OPEB adjustments and severance-related costs.  

“We are positioning Verizon for future growth and continued sustainable shareholder value,” said Chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam. “In the fourth quarter we expanded our customer base in highly  

 competitive wireless and broadband markets. This capped a year in which we delivered solid results and returned value to shareholders, including $9.3 billion in dividends. We enter 2017 with confidence, based on our investments in next-generation networks and the new capabilities we have acquired. Our goal is to continue to earn our customers’ loyalty every day in a rapidly expanding mobile-first digital world.”  

Consolidated results  

Total consolidated operating revenues in fourth-quarter 2016 were $32.3 billion, a 5.6 percent decrease compared with fourth-quarter 2015. Full-year 2016 revenues were nearly $126.0 billion, a 4.3 percent decline. Excluding revenues from since-divested local landline businesses and AOL, adjusted full-year total operating revenues on a comparable basis (non-GAAP) would have declined approximately 2.4 percent.  

Net income was $4.6 billion in fourth-quarter 2016, and net income margin was 14.2 percent. EBITDA (non-GAAP, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) totaled $12.0 billion, and the consolidated EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) was 37.1 percent in fourth-quarter 2016.  

During 2016, Verizon invested in its networks with $17.1 billion in capital expenditures, completed wireline divestitures of three markets, negotiated new labor contracts, executed successful technical trials of 5G wireless service and expanded its new growth businesses.  

In these new markets the digital media business, led by AOL, generated $532 million in revenues net of traffic acquisition costs (non-GAAP) in fourth-quarter 2016. This declined about 5 percent year-over-year due to a revenue lift in fourth-quarter 2015 related to AOL’s Microsoft deal, but increased around 10 percent compared with third-quarter 2016.  

IoT (Internet of Things) revenues, led by telematics, increased 21 percent on a comparable basis to fourth-quarter 2015, to $243 million. Verizon expects to sustain this trend in strong IoT revenue growth. Including acquisitions, IoT revenues increased more than 60 percent in fourth-quarter 2016.  

Verizon Wireless highlights  

   •    Verizon reported 591,000 retail postpaid net additions in fourth-quarter 2016. These net additions exclude wholesale device and wholesale IoT connections. At year-end 2016, Verizon had 114.2 million retail connections, a 1.9 percent year-over-year increase. Verizon’s industry-leading retail postpaid connections base grew 2.1 percent to 108.8 million, and retail prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million. Full-year postpaid net additions of 2.3 million included 1.8 million 4G smartphones and 1.4 million 4G tablets, offset primarily by declines in basic phones and 3G smartphones.

At year-end, approximately 46 percent of postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan.  

   •    The 591,000 retail postpaid net additions in fourth-quarter 2016 included 552,000 4G LTE smartphones.

In fourth-quarter 2016, Verizon Wireless generated $8.6 billion in segment EBITDA (non-GAAP), a year-over-year decrease of 5.2 percent. Segment EBITDA margin on total revenues (non-GAAP) was 36.9 percent, compared with 38.4 percent in fourth-quarter 2015.  

   •    In fourth-quarter 2016, overall traffic on LTE increased by approximately 49 percent compared with fourth-quarter 2015, while Verizon extended its lead in the industry’s third-party network performance studies across the country.

   •    In fourth-quarter 2016, Verizon added a net of 68,000 Fios Internet connections and 21,000 Fios Video connections. Customer demand for Custom TV continues to remain strong. At year-end, Verizon had 5.7 million Fios Internet connections and 4.7 million Fios Video connections.

   •    Minimum pension funding requirements of approximately $600 million in 2017;  

   •    The 2017 effective tax rate to be in the range of 34 percent to 36 percent, excluding impacts from potential tax reform;  

   •    On track for a return by the 2018-2019 timeframe to the company’s credit-rating profile prior to the acquisition of Vodafone’s indirect 45 percent interest in Verizon Wireless in early 2014.
