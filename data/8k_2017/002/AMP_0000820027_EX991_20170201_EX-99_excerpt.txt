GAAP Results — Fourth Quarter 

Net revenues of $3.1 billion decreased 1 percent or $41 million from last year. The decrease in revenue related to the deconsolidation of certain collateralized loan obligations and property funds was offset by the increase in the market impact of hedges on investments. Operating net revenue decreased $41 million or 1 percent versus last year as described below. 

Expenses of $2.6 billion decreased 2 percent as a result of lower general and administrative expenses and the deconsolidation of certain investment entities. 

Operating Results — Fourth Quarter 

Operating net revenues of $2.9 billion decreased 1 percent or $41 million versus last year. Strong net revenue growth in Advice & Wealth Management from growth in client assets was offset by lower Asset Management revenues relating to outflows, foreign exchange translation and elevated performance fees a year ago. 

Operating expenses of $2.4 billion decreased 1 percent. General and administrative expense declined 4 percent, equally driven by continued focus on managing underlying operating expenses and lower foreign exchange rates. 

The company continued to deliver a strong return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends of $523 million in the quarter and $2.2 billion for the year.

“Ameriprise had a strong fourth quarter and a good year in light of the operating environment,” said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. “Our fee-based businesses continued to generate strong profitability. Advice & Wealth Management in particular led the way with a record high for retail client assets, strong net inflows into investment advisory accounts, as well as very good advisor productivity.” 

“Our capital management actions continue to reflect the strength of our financial foundation and significant free cash flow generation, as well as our consistent investment in the business and approach to capital return. We delivered a differentiated operating return on equity of 22.2 percent at year end, or 24.6 percent when excluding annual unlocking. I am pleased to add that 2016 was the sixth consecutive year where we returned more than 100 percent of our operating earnings to shareholders while consistently investing in the business.”

NM Not Meaningful — variance equal to or greater than 100% 

Asset Management reported solid pretax operating earnings of $169 million. Results included a benefit from market appreciation that was more than offset by the cumulative impact of net outflows, as well as lower performance fees and CLO liquidation benefits than a year ago. Fourth quarter margin reflected effective expense management—pretax operating margin was 22.2 percent compared to 23.2 percent a year ago. Adjusted net pretax operating margin remains competitive at 36.5 percent compared to 36.3 percent a year ago. 

Adjusting for $18 billion of unfavorable foreign exchange translation, AUM was unchanged year-over-year at $454 billion. 

Operating net revenues declined to $761 million compared to a year ago, reflecting the impact of lower asset levels and higher performance fees and CLO liquidation benefits in the prior year period. 

Operating expenses of $592 million declined 8 percent due to well managed general and administrative expenses, lower distribution expenses and the impact of foreign exchange rates. 

Net outflows were $2.1 billion in the quarter. Retail net inflows, excluding former parent flows, were $500 million. Global retail net flows included $4.4 billion of reinvested dividends, elevated outflows in North America consistent with industry outflows for active strategies and lower retail activity among UK and European investors post the Brexit vote. Global institutional outflows, excluding former parent, were $700 million reflecting a slowdown in funding of global institutional mandates in the quarter, which is expected to improve in the first half of 2017. Former parent company related outflows were $1.9 billion in the quarter.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

NM Not Meaningful — variance equal to or greater than 100%

Variable annuity cash sales declined to $1.1 billion in the quarter, reflecting recent industry trends. Account balances increased 1 percent from market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. 

Fixed annuity operating earnings decreased to $20 million from $23 million reflecting fixed annuity spread compression from continued low interest rates and lower account balances. Account balances declined 6 percent from limited new product sales and lapses of older policies.
