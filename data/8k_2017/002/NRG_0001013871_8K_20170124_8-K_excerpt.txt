Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement. 

On January 24, 2017, NRG Energy, Inc. (“NRG”), as borrower, completed an amendment to its senior secured credit facility (the “Senior Credit Facilities”) pursuant to the terms of the First Amendment Agreement, dated as of January 24, 2017 (the “Amendment Agreement”), to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2016 (the “Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), to reduce the margin on certain borrowings under its Senior Credit Facilities. 

Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities are determined at NRG’s election, at LIBOR or at base rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin. The Amendment Agreement decreases the applicable margins for borrowings under (i) ABR Term Loans from 1.75% to 1.25% and (ii) Eurodollar Term Loans from 2.75% to 2.25%, as such terms are defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The decreases to the applicable margins became effective upon execution of the Amendment Agreement. 

The foregoing description of the Amendment Agreement is a summary and is therefore qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the Amendment Agreement, filed as exhibit 10.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
