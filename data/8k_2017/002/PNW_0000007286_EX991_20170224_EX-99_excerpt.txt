PINNACLE WEST REPORTS 2016 FULL-YEAR AND FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS

•Full-year results benefit from strong operational performance and cost management

•Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station continues record-breaking performance

•Company makes progress on key regulatory initiatives

PHOENIX - Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $442.0 million, or $3.95 per diluted share, for full-year 2016. This result compares with net income of $437.3 million, or $3.92 per share, in 2015.

“Reflecting steady improvement in Arizona’s economic conditions and our employees’ continued focus on sustainable cost management, our year-end results were in line with our expectations,” said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Don Brandt. “In addition, our employees contributed to strong operational performance, including a record-setting performance at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station.”

Palo Verde achieved its 25th consecutive year as the nation’s largest power producer - producing 32.3 million megawatt-hours of carbon-free electricity. The plant’s three units achieved a capacity factor of 93.2 percent, and Unit 3’s fall 2016 refueling and maintenance outage was the shortest in plant history at 28 days, 17 hours. By comparison, the average length of a refueling and maintenance outage at all U.S. reactors in 2015 was 36.3 days, according to most recent industry data.

Brandt cited additional examples of the Company’s 2016 achievements:

•For the fifth straight year, Pinnacle West increased its common dividend, raising it by 4.8 percent.

•On October 1, the company commenced participation in the western regional Energy Imbalance Market (EIM), resulting in trading efficiencies and customer savings of about $6 million during the 2016 fourth quarter. 

•Arizona Public Service (APS) launched a suite of new tools that provides customers with an improved and more customized service experience, including a mobile app, an online outage map and a new automated phone system.

•APS continued investing in an advanced energy grid, including new technologies that enable customers to have greater choice and control over their energy use, while increasing reliability. These technologies included two separate “next generation” microgrids installed in Phoenix and at the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, Ariz.

•The Red Rock Solar Plant - APS’s largest self-owned grid-scale solar power plant at 40 megawatts - also was completed, helping the company reach one gigawatt of solar on its system and becoming the only utility outside California to achieve this milestone. To date, the company’s total investment in solar energy is about $2 billion.

•APS’s power reliability for 2016 remained among the strongest in the industry and received a top-quartile score from JD Power for “Power Quality & Reliability” among residential customers. 

Looking forward, Brandt said the company remains committed to investing in infrastructure that creates value for customers and shareholders alike, while also building on the positive regulatory outcome in Arizona’s value and cost of distributed generation docket, which was decided in late 2016.

“We will continue to work collaboratively with regulators and other stakeholders on key issues important to Arizona’s energy future, including achieving a constructive regulatory outcome in our current rate review,” he said. “In many respects, this case serves as a transition from the challenges of the present to the opportunities of the future. “

The 2016 full-year financial results comparison was positively impacted by the following major factors:

•Higher lost fixed cost recovery revenue, an increase in transmission proceeds and revenue from the Company’s AZ Sun program improved earnings by $0.18 per share compared to 2015.

•Retail electricity sales improved earnings $0.05 per share due to changes in customer usage patterns and related pricing. Compared to a year ago, total customer growth improved 1.4 percent.

•The effects of weather variations improved the Company’s earnings by $0.02 per share, although weather was still unfavorable compared to normal. For the year, the company had a 6 percent decrease in cooling degree-days and a 5 percent decrease in heating degree-days (measures of the effects of weather) versus 2015. Compared to 10-year historical averages, cooling and heating degree days were down 2.7 percent and 18.7 percent, respectively.

•Lower interest expense, net of AFUDC, contributed $0.02 per share.

•The net effect of miscellaneous items increased earnings $0.06 per share, including the second-quarter sale of a 50 percent ownership stake in an existing transmission line, which resulted in a $0.03 contribution to the Company’s bottom line in the second quarter.

The above positive factors were largely offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses, which reduced annual earnings by $0.30 per share. These expenses were largely associated with major planned outages at the company’s Four Corners Power Plant in the first half of the year; 

higher transmission, distribution and customer service costs associated with implementation of new systems; and higher employee benefit costs, among other items. 

For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, Pinnacle West reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $53.2 million, or $0.47 per diluted share. This result compares with net income of $41.1 million, or $0.37 per share, for the same period a year ago.

The 2016 fourth-quarter results comparison versus the same 2015 period was positively impacted by lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower retail electricity sales. While October 2016 proved to be hotter than average, sales decreased in the last two months of the year, with December turning out to be the third mildest December since 1970 - a span of 46 years.
