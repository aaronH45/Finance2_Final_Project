Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition

This Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends the Current Report on Form 8-K (the “Form 8-K”) of Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (the “Company”), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2017. 

On February 9, 2017, the Company issued a press release announcing its financial results for the period ended December 31, 2016 (the “Earnings Release”). The full text of the Earnings Release was furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K.

The Company is filing this Form 8-K/A to reflect certain reclassifications in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the period ended December 31, 2016 included in the Earnings Release. The Earnings Release announced that Net Cash from Operating Activities for 2016 was $967 million and Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP measure, for 2016 was $745 million. As a result of the reclassifications described below, these two amounts changes to $920 million and $702 million, respectively. 

These reclassifications to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the period ended December 31, 2016 included (i) a $49 million reduction to “Other assets” in Cash Flows from Operating Activities; and (ii) an increase of $49 million in “Proceeds from issuance of shares and excess tax benefit” in Cash Flows (used in)/from Financing Activities. 

In addition, $4 million reported as a use of cash in “Additions to fixed assets and software for internal use” in Cash Flows (used in)/from Investing Activities was reclassified to a use of cash in “Acquisition of and dividends paid to noncontrolling interests” in Cash Flows (used in)/from Financing Activities. 

Finally, a $206 million cash source originally included in “Other assets” in Cash Flows from Operating Activities was reclassified as “Other liabilities”. This adjustment had no overall effect on Net cash from Operating Activities. All other reclassifications were inconsequential and had no meaningful effect on the amounts presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

In aggregate, these reclassification reduced Net Cash from Operations by $47 million and increased Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities and Net Cash used in Financing Activities by $7 million and $40 million, respectively. 

The revised Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K/A and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Free Cash Flow represents the cash that WTW generates through operations after considering required capital expenditures. This non-GAAP measure is not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the information contained within the Company’s financial statements.

A revised reconciliation of Net Cash from Operating Activities and Free Cash Flow for 2016 is reflected in the table below:
