[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

FINANCIAL SUMMARY

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Primarily attributable to noncontrolling interests related to consolidated investment management funds.

(b)Operating leverage is the rate of increase (decrease) in total revenue less the rate of increase (decrease) in total noninterest expense. See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 24 for the components of this measure.

(c)Non-GAAP information for all periods presented excludes the net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests related to consolidated investment management funds, amortization of intangible assets and M&I, litigation and restructuring charges.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Foreign exchange and other trading revenue totaled $161 million in 4Q16 compared with $173 million in 4Q15 and $183 million in 3Q16. In 4Q16, foreign exchange revenue totaled $175 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher volatility. 

Other trading losses were $14 million in 4Q16, compared with other trading revenue of $8 million in both 4Q15 and 3Q16. Both decreases primarily reflect the impact of interest rate hedging activities, which are offset in net interest revenue.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Investment and other income was $70 million in 4Q16, compared with $93 million in 4Q15 and $92 million in 3Q16. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower other income related to termination fees in our clearing business recorded in 4Q15, partially offset by higher income from corporate/bank-owned life insurance. The year-over-year and sequential decreases in other income also reflect the impact of increased investments in renewable energy, which generate losses in other revenue that are more than offset by tax benefits recorded to the provision for income taxes.

NET INTEREST REVENUE

FTE – fully taxable equivalent.

KEY POINTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Effective Oct. 1, 2016, we changed our accounting method for the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on certain mortgage-backed securities from the prepayment method (also referred to as the retrospective method) to the contractual method. Net interest revenue for 4Q16 was positively adjusted approximately $15 million as a result of this change. Prior periods were not adjusted as the impacts were not material. Net interest revenue for 4Q16 would have been higher had we continued to use the prepayment method.

•The $25 million impact of interest rate hedging activities and the $15 million premium amortization adjustment positively impacted the 4Q16 net interest margin by 5 basis points.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

N/M – Not meaningful.

KEY POINTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower staff expense and M&I, litigation and restructuring charges, partially offset by higher other and software and equipment expenses. The decrease in staff expense year-over-year was primarily driven by the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, lower employee benefits and severance expense. The increase in other expense primarily reflects a downward adjustment in bank assessment charges recorded in 4Q15. 

•The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower staff expense and M&I, litigation and restructuring charges, partially offset by higher professional, legal and other purchased services, software and equipment and business development expenses. The decrease in staff expense was primarily due to lower incentives and severance expenses. The increase in professional, legal and other purchased services primarily reflects higher regulatory compliance costs.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO

At Dec. 31, 2016, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio totaled $114.3 billion. The net unrealized pre-tax loss on our total securities portfolio was $221 million at Dec. 31, 2016 compared with a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $1.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2016. The decrease in the net unrealized pre-tax gain was primarily driven by an increase in market interest rates. At Dec. 31, 2016, the fair value of the held-to-maturity securities totaled $40.7 billion and represented 36% of the fair value of the total investment securities portfolio.

The following table shows the distribution of our investment securities portfolio.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Amortized cost before impairments.

(b)These RMBS were included in the former Grantor Trust and were marked-to-market in 2009. We believe these RMBS would receive higher credit ratings if these ratings incorporated, as additional credit enhancements, the difference between the written-down amortized cost and the current face amount of each of these securities.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NONPERFORMING ASSETS 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Nonperforming assets were $107 million at Dec. 31, 2016, a decrease of $2 million compared with Sept. 30, 2016, and a decrease of $185 million compared with Dec. 31, 2015. The decrease compared with Dec. 31, 2015 primarily reflects the receipt of trust assets from the bankruptcy proceeding of Sentinel.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PROVISION AND NET CHARGE-OFFS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The allowance for credit losses was $281 million at Dec. 31, 2016, an increase of $7 million compared with $274 million at Sept. 30, 2016.

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Regulatory capital ratios for Dec. 31, 2016 are preliminary. For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under the U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches.

(b)The leverage capital ratio is based on Tier 1 capital, as phased-in and quarterly average total assets. 

(c)See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 24 for a reconciliation of these ratios.

(d)Estimated.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Primarily related to stock awards, the exercise of stock options and stock issued for employee benefit plans.

(b) Reflects transitional adjustments to CET1 required under the U.S. capital rules.

(c) Estimated.

BNY Mellon 4Q16 Earnings Release

The table presented below compares the fully phased-in Basel III capital components and risk-based ratios to those capital components and ratios determined on a transitional basis.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Preliminary.

(b) Reflects transitional adjustments to CET1, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital required under the U.S. capital rules. 

(c) Estimated.

BNY Mellon has presented its estimated fully phased-in CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios and the fully phased-in SLR based on its interpretation of the U.S. capital rules, which are being gradually phased-in over a multi-year period, and on the application of such rules to BNY Mellon’s businesses as currently conducted. Management views the estimated fully phased-in CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios and fully phased-in SLR as key measures in monitoring BNY Mellon’s capital position and progress against future regulatory capital standards. Additionally, the presentation of the estimated fully phased-in CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios 

Page - 14

BNY Mellon 4Q16 Earnings Release

and fully phased-in SLR are intended to allow investors to compare these ratios with estimates presented by other companies. 

Our capital and liquidity ratios are necessarily subject to, among other things, BNY Mellon’s further review of applicable rules, anticipated compliance with all necessary enhancements to model calibration, approval by regulators of certain models used as part of RWA calculations, other refinements, further implementation guidance from regulators, market practices and standards and any changes BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. Consequently, our capital and liquidity ratios remain subject to ongoing review and revision and may change based on these factors.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio (“SLR”)

The following table presents the SLR on both the transitional and fully phased-in Basel III basis for BNY Mellon and our largest bank subsidiary, The Bank of New York Mellon.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Dec. 31, 2016 information is preliminary. 

(b)Estimated.

(c)The estimated fully phased-in SLR (Non-GAAP) is based on our interpretation of the U.S. capital rules. When the SLR is fully phased-in in 2018 as a required minimum ratio, we expect to maintain an SLR of over 5%. The minimum required SLR is 3% and there is a 2% buffer, in addition to the minimum, that is applicable to U.S. G-SIBs. The insured depository institution subsidiaries of the U.S. G-SIBs, including those of BNY Mellon, must maintain a 6% SLR to be considered “well capitalized.” 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”)

The U.S. LCR rules became effective Jan. 1, 2015 and require BNY Mellon to meet an LCR of 100% when fully phased-in on Jan. 1, 2017. Our estimated LCR on a consolidated basis is compliant with the fully phased-in requirements of the U.S. LCR as of Dec. 31, 2016. Our consolidated HQLA before haircuts totaled $156 billion at Dec. 31, 2016, compared with $195 billion at Sept. 30, 2016 and $218 billion at Dec. 31, 2015.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION – EXPLANATION OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

BNY Mellon has included in this Earnings Release certain Non-GAAP financial measures based on fully phased-in CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios, the fully phased-in SLR and tangible common shareholders’ equity. BNY Mellon believes that the CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis, the SLR on a fully phased-in basis and the ratio of tangible common shareholders’ equity to tangible assets of operations are measures of capital strength that provide additional useful information to investors, supplementing the capital ratios which are, or were, required by regulatory authorities. The tangible common shareholders’ equity ratio, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, includes changes in investment securities valuations which are reflected in total shareholders’ equity. In addition, this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual book value of assets, as opposed to a percentage of a risk-based reduced value established in accordance with regulatory requirements, although BNY Mellon in its reconciliation has excluded certain assets which are given a zero percent risk-weighting for regulatory purposes and the assets of consolidated investment management funds to which BNY Mellon has limited economic exposure. Further, BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, is a useful additional measure for investors because it presents a measure of those assets that can generate income. BNY Mellon has provided a measure of tangible book value per common share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of tangible assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding.

BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures, which exclude the effect of noncontrolling interests related to consolidated investment management funds, and expense measures, which exclude M&I, litigation and restructuring charges and amortization of intangible assets. Earnings per share, return on equity, operating leverage and operating margin measures, which exclude some or all of these items, as well as the (recovery) impairment charge related to Sentinel, are also presented. Operating margin measures may also exclude the provision for credit losses and distribution and servicing expense. BNY Mellon believes that these measures are useful to investors because they permit a focus on period-to-period comparisons, which relate to the ability of BNY Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where such matters are within BNY Mellon’s control. M&I expenses primarily relate to acquisitions and generally continue for approximately three years after the transaction. Litigation charges represent accruals for loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable, but exclude standard business-related legal fees. Restructuring charges relate to our streamlining actions, Operational Excellence Initiatives and migrating positions to Global Delivery Centers. Excluding these charges mentioned above permits investors to view expenses on a basis consistent with how management views the business. 

The presentation of income (loss) from consolidated investment management funds, net of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests related to the consolidation of certain investment management funds permits investors to view revenue on a basis consistent with how management views the business. BNY Mellon believes that these presentations, as a supplement to GAAP information, give investors a clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses. 

Each of these measures as described above is used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a company-wide and on a business-level basis.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Non-GAAP information for all periods presented excludes net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated investment management funds, amortization of intangible assets and M&I, litigation and restructuring charges.

(b)Income before taxes divided by total revenue. 

(c)Our GAAP earnings include tax-advantaged investments such as low income housing, renewable energy, bank-owned life insurance and tax-exempt securities. The benefits of these investments are primarily reflected in tax expense.
