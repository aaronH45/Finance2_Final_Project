CINCINNATI, January 20, 2017 - The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) reported second quarter fiscal year 2017 net sales of $16.9 billion, unchanged versus the prior year. Organic sales increased two percent. Organic sales and organic volume increased in all five business segments. Diluted net earnings per share were $2.88, an increase of 157% versus the prior year, including a gain of $1.95 per share from the Beauty Brands divestiture to Coty. Core earnings per share were $1.08, an increase of four percent versus the prior year. Currency-neutral core EPS increased nine percent versus the prior year. 

Operating cash flow was $3.0 billion for the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 82%. The Company returned $1.8 billion of cash to shareholders as dividends, repurchased $1.5 billion of common stock and exchanged shares with a value of $9.4 billion in the Beauty Brands transaction. 

“We delivered good results in the second quarter in a difficult operating environment,” said Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer David Taylor. “Stronger top-line performance in the first half of the fiscal year is enabling us to increase our organic sales growth outlook for the full year - another step towards the levels of balanced top-line, bottom-line, and cash flow growth that will consistently put P&G shareholder value creation among the best in our industry.”  

October - December Quarter Discussion

Net sales in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 were $16.9 billion, unchanged versus prior year, including a negative two percent impact from foreign exchange. Organic sales increased two percent driven by a two percent increase in organic shipment volume. Pricing and mix had no net impact on sales for the quarter. All-in volume increased one percent including the impacts of minor brand divestitures and lost sales to Venezuelan subsidiaries.

* Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. 

** Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions/divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. 

•Beauty segment organic sales increased three percent versus year ago behind growth in both Hair Care and Skin & Personal Care. Organic sales increased in Skin & Personal Care due to the continued growth of the super-premium SK-II skin care brand. Organic sales increased in Hair Care due to innovation and marketing support on the Pantene and Head & Shoulders brands.  

•Grooming segment organic sales increased one percent due to innovation-driven volume growth in both Shave Care and Appliances. Organic sales increased low single digits globally in Shave Care as higher volume outside the U.S. from innovation and increased marketing support more than offset negative competitive impacts in the U.S. Organic sales were up low single digits in Appliances driven by the continued success of premium innovation across the top markets.  

•Health Care segment organic sales increased seven percent behind higher organic volume in both Oral Care and Personal Health Care. Product innovation drove a high single digit increase in organic sales in Oral Care, while Personal Health Care organic sales increased low single digits primarily due to market growth.  

•Fabric and Home Care segment organic sales increased one percent versus year ago driven by higher volume from innovation and marketing investments in Fabric Care along with increased pricing in Home Care. Fabric Care and Home Care organic sales both increased low single digits.  

•Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales increased one percent driven by organic volume growth in all three businesses. Baby care volume increased behind product innovation, increased marketing support and market growth. Feminine Care and Family Care organic volume growth was driven by product innovation. Organic sales increased low single digits in Feminine Care and mid-single digits in Family Care while decreasing low single digits in Baby Care due to increased promotional investments.  

Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.93, a decrease of eight percent versus the base period. Diluted net earnings per share were $2.88, an increase of 157% versus the prior year. Current year results included a $1.95 per share gain from discontinued operations from the Beauty Brands divestiture to Coty, which closed on October 1, 2016, non-core restructuring charges of $0.03 per share and a non-core charge for early debt retirement of $0.13 per share. Core earnings per share, which exclude non-core restructuring charges, early debt retirement fees and the results of discontinued operations, were $1.08, an increase of four percent versus the prior year. Currency-neutral core earnings per share increased nine percent for the quarter. 

Reported gross margin increased 80 basis points, including a 10 basis point benefit from lower non-core restructuring charges. Core gross margin improved 70 basis points, including 50 basis points of negative foreign exchange impacts. On a currency-neutral basis, core gross margin increased 120 basis points, driven by 210 basis points of productivity cost savings partially offset by headwinds from unfavorable mix and commodity cost increases.

Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percent of sales increased 60 basis points on a reported basis versus the prior year, including a 10 basis point net benefit from a year-on-year decline in non-core restructuring charges. Core SG&A as a percentage of sales increased 70 basis points, including 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. On a currency-neutral basis, core SG&A was up 60 basis points versus the prior year as increased investments in marketing activities were partially offset by productivity savings.

Reported operating profit margin increased 20 basis points. Core operating profit margin was in-line with the prior year, including 60 basis points of foreign exchange impacts. On a currency-neutral basis, core operating profit margin increased 60 basis points driven by productivity cost savings of 230 basis points for the quarter.

Fiscal Year 2017 Guidance

P&G said it is raising its guidance for organic sales growth from approximately two percent to a range of two to three percent for fiscal 2017. The Company now expects the combined headwinds of foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures to reduce sales growth by two to three percentage points. As a result, P&G estimates all-in sales to be in line with the prior fiscal year.

The Company maintained its expectation for core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits versus fiscal 2016 core EPS of $3.67. All-in GAAP earnings per share are expected to increase 48% to 50% versus fiscal year 2016 GAAP EPS of $3.69. The fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS estimate includes approximately $0.12 per share of non-core restructuring costs and $0.13 per share of charges related to early debt retirement that was executed in the second fiscal quarter. Also included in GAAP EPS is the $1.95 gain from the divestiture of 41 Beauty Brands to Coty in a transaction that was completed on October 1, 2016.

Exhibit 1: Non-GAAP Measures

In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used in Procter & Gamble's January 20, 2017 earnings release and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e. trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by Management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.

The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:

Incremental restructuring: The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. Beginning in 2012 Procter & Gamble began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. 

Early debt extinguishment charges: During the three months ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a charge of $345 million after tax due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. This charge represents the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished. Management does not view this charge as indicative of the Company’s operating performance or underlying business results. 

We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. Both of these items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. 

Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Management believes this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis.

Core operating profit margin: Core operating profit margin is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time.

Core gross margin: Core gross margin is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides a supplemental perspective to the Company’s operating efficiency over time.

Core EPS and currency-neutral Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Currency-neutral Core EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Management views these non-GAAP measures as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time.

Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding tax payments related to the Beauty Brands divestiture, which are non-recurring and not considered indicative of underlying cash flow performance. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment.

Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the loss on early debt extinguishment and gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands, which are non-recurring and not considered indicative of underlying earnings performance. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent.
