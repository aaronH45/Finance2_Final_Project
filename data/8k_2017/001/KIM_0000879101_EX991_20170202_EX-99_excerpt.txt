 NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 2, 2017--Kimco Realty Corp. (NYSE: KIM) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.  

 Highlights - Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016:   

 Increased pro-rata occupancy by 30 basis points over the prior quarter to 95.4%;  

 Achieved small shop occupancy of 89.9%, representing an increase of 120 basis points year-over-year and the highest small shop occupancy level since 2010;  

 Generated new leasing spreads of 36.5% in the fourth quarter with overall rent spreads expanding 14.8% during the same period;  

 As previously announced, issued a new $400 million, seven-year unsecured bond with a coupon of 2.70% and a new $350 million, 30-year unsecured bond with a coupon of 4.125% in the fourth quarter 2016;  

 As previously announced, completed $1.3 billion of transaction volume in the U.S. during 2016 through the acquisition of 20 high-quality core market properties and land parcels totaling $746.1 million, as well as the sale of 40 non-core assets for $528.2 million; and  

 Essentially completed the exit from Canada through the sale of 34 Canadian shopping centers for a gross price of USD $894.7 million during 2016.   

 Financial Results  

 Net income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $66.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to $360.0 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2015. The decrease was primarily due to $345.5 million* of lower gains on sales of operating properties and $15.6 million* of higher impairments attributable to the sale or pending disposition of operating properties in 2016. Both gains on sales and operating property impairments are excluded from the calculation of Funds From Operations available to common shareholders (NAREIT FFO).  

 For the full year 2016, net income available to common shareholders was $332.6 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared to $831.2 million, or $2.00 per diluted share, for the full year 2015. The change was attributable to $379.0 million* of lower gains on sales of operating properties and $49.9 million* of higher impairments attributable to the sale or pending disposition of operating properties in 2016.  

 NAREIT FFO, a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance, was $163.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2016 compared to $143.2 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2015. NAREIT FFO for the fourth quarter of 2016 included $2.6 million of transactional income (net of transactional charges). This compares to ($9.9) million of transactional charges (net of transactional income) in the fourth quarter of 2015.  

 For the full year 2016, NAREIT FFO was $555.7 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, compared to $643.2 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, for the full year 2015. NAREIT FFO for 2016 included ($73.7) million of transactional charges (net of transactional income) primarily attributable to charges incurred for the prepayment of debt and the merging of the company’s taxable REIT subsidiary, Kimco Realty Services, Inc., into Kimco (TRS Merger) which totaled $109.2 million. This compares to $39.8 million of transactional income (net of transactional charges) recognized in 2015 NAREIT FFO.  

 *Amounts shown before any impact from taxes and non-controlling interests  

 FFO as adjusted, which excludes the effects of non-operating impairments as well as transactional income and charges, was $160.4 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2016 compared to $153.1 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2015.  

 For the full year 2016, FFO as adjusted was $629.4 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, compared to $603.4 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, for the full year 2015.  

 A reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to NAREIT FFO and FFO as adjusted is provided in the tables accompanying this press release.  

 Operating Results   

 Pro-rata occupancy ended the quarter at 95.4%, representing an increase of 30 basis points sequentially and a decrease of 40 basis points from the fourth quarter 2015;  

 Small shop (under 10,000 square feet) pro-rata occupancy ended the quarter at 89.9%, an increase of 70 basis points sequentially and 120 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2015.

 Pro-rata rental-rate leasing spreads increased 14.8% during the fourth quarter 2016, with rental rates for new leases up 36.5% and renewals/options increasing 7.1%. For the full year 2016, pro-rata rental-rate leasing spreads increased 12.0% with rental rates for new leases up 29.3% and renewals/options increasing 7.5%;  

 Income from continuing operations was $69.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2016, representing a $269.3 million decrease compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to lower gains on sales and higher impairments of operating properties. For the full year 2016, income from continuing operations totaled $299.4 million compared to $774.4 million for 2015. The decrease was attributable to $109.2 million of charges related to the early extinguishment of debt and the TRS merger as well as $329.0 million from lower gains on sales and higher impairments of operating properties; and  

 U.S. same-property NOI increased 2.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Full year 2016 same-property NOI increased 2.8% compared to full year 2015.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

 NAREIT FFO: A supplemental non-GAAP measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds from operations (“NAREIT FFO”) as net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), excluding (i) gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and change in control of interests, plus (ii) depreciation and amortization of operating properties and (iii) impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments and (iv) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect NAREIT FFO on the same basis.  

 The company considers NAREIT FFO an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present NAREIT FFO when reporting results. Comparison of our presentation of NAREIT FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.  

 FFO as Adjusted: A supplemental non-GAAP measure that the company believes is more reflective of its core operating performance and provides investors and analysts an additional measure to compare the company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. FFO as adjusted is generally calculated by the Company as NAREIT FFO excluding certain transactional income and expenses and non-operating impairments which management believes are not reflective of the results within the company’s operating real estate portfolio.  

 U.S. Same-Property NOI: A supplemental non-GAAP measure of real estate companies’ operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The company considers U.S. same-property NOI as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of U.S. properties that have been owned by the company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods including those properties under redevelopment. It excludes properties under development and pending stabilization; properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a projects inclusion in operating real estate. U.S. same-property NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the Company's properties.  

 U.S. same-property NOI is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees, amortization of above/below market rents and includes charges for bad debt) less operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company’s proportionate share of U.S. same-property NOI from U.S. unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. The company’s method of calculating U.S. same-property NOI may differ from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.

  (2)     Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. The impact of the conversion would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income and therefore have not been included.   

  (3)     Adjusted for earnings attributable from participating securities of ($524) and ($1,950) for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and ($2,018) and ($4,134) for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Funds from operations would be increased by $229 and $217 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and $881 and $781 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively   

  (2) Related to gains, impairments and depreciation on operating properties, where applicable.   

  Funds from operations is a supplemental non-GAAP measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds from operations as net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), excluding (i) gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and change in control of interests, plus (ii) depreciation and amortization of operating properties and (iii) impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments and (iv) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis.   

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  U.S. Same Property NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. U.S. Same Property NOI is considered by management to be important performance measure of Kimco's operations, and management believes that this measure is frequently used by securities analysts and investors as a measure of Kimco's operating performance as this measure includes only the net operating income of properties that have been owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods including those properties under redevelopment and exclude properties under development and pending stabilization. As such, U.S. Same Property NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular periods presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the operating performance of Kimco's properties.   

  U.S. Same Property NOI is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees and above/below market rents and includes charges for bad debt) less operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense, plus Kimco's proportionate share of U.S. Same Property NOI from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. U.S. Same Property NOI includes all properties that are owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods and excludes properties under development and properties pending stabilization. Properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following their inclusion in operating real estate. Kimco’s method of calculating U.S. Same Property NOI may differ from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.   

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Projections involve numerous assumptions such as rental income (including assumptions on percentage rent), interest rates, tenant defaults, occupancy rates, foreign currency exchange rates (such as the US-Canadian rate), selling prices of properties held for disposition, expenses (including salaries and employee costs), insurance costs and numerous other factors. Not all of these factors are determinable at this time and actual results may vary from the projected results, and may be above or below the range indicated. The above range represents management’s estimate of results based upon these assumptions as of the date of this press release.
