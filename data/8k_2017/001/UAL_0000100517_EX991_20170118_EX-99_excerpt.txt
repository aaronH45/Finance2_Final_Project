Appendix A: reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures  

UAL evaluates its financial performance utilizing various accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and Non-GAAP financial measures, including: income (loss) before taxes excluding special items, pre-tax margin excluding special items, net income (loss) excluding special items and CASM, as adjusted, among others. UAL believes that adjusting for special items is useful to investors because special items are non-recurring charges not indicative of UAL’s ongoing performance. For additional information related to special items, see the press release issued by UAL dated January 17, 2017, filed on that date with the SEC as an exhibit to UAL’s Form 8-K.

UAL also presented diluted earnings per share excluding special items for the periods presented in 2015 adjusted for the impact of tax expense using the effective tax rate from the respective period in 2016 in order to make the financial measures more comparable. UAL had minimal income tax expense in the second half of 2015 that was offset by the release of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in a net income tax benefit.

Appendix A: reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures (continued)  

CASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline’s cost structure and efficiency. UAL reports CASM excluding profit sharing, third-party business expenses, fuel, and special charges. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges is useful to investors because special charges are non-recurring charges not indicative of UAL’s ongoing performance. UAL believes that excluding third-party business expenses, such as maintenance, ground handling and catering services for third parties, fuel sales and non-air mileage redemptions, provides more meaningful disclosure because these expenses are not directly related to UAL’s core business. UAL also believes that excluding fuel costs from certain measures is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management’s performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item over which management has limited influence. UAL excludes profit sharing and the impact from new labor agreements, as these exclusions allow investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provide a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry.
