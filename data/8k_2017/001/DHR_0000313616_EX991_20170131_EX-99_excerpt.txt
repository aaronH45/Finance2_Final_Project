Forecasted Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations

1 The forward-looking estimates set forth above do not reflect future gains and charges that are inherently difficult to predict and estimate due to their unknown timing, effect and/or significance, such as certain future gains or losses on the sale of investments, acquisition or divestiture-related gains or charges and discrete tax items.

Core Revenue Growth

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2 We use the term “core revenue” to refer to GAAP revenue from continuing operations excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to divested businesses or product lines not considered discontinued operations (“acquisition sales”) and (2) the impact of currency translation. The portion of GAAP revenue from continuing operations attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. We use the term “core revenue growth” to refer to the measure of comparing current period core revenue with the corresponding period of the prior year.

DANAHER CORPORATION

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

(continued)

A Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in the following historical and forecasted periods ($ in millions) (only the pretax amounts set forth below are reflected in the amortization line item above):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

B Charge for early extinguishment of borrowings ($179 million pretax as presented in this line item, $112 million after-tax) incurred in the third quarter of 2016. The Company did not incur any charges related to the early extinguishment of borrowings in any other quarter of 2016 or in 2015, and therefore no such elimination item is reflected in the calculation of Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share From Continuing Operations for any other period presented.

C Gains on resolution of acquisition-related matters ($18 million pretax is presented in this line item, $14 million after-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2016.

D Gain on sales of investments in the year ended December 31, 2015 ($12 million pretax as presented in this line item, $8 million after-tax).

E Gain on sales of investments in the year ended December 31, 2016 ($223 million pretax as presented in this line item, $140 million after-tax).

F Fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue, net of the impact of freezing pension benefits, in each case related to the acquisition of Pall Corporation and incurred in the three month period ended December 31, 2015 ($60 million pretax as presented in this line item, $48 million after-tax); acquisition-related transaction costs deemed significant ($21 million pretax as presented in this line item, $16 million after-tax), change in control payments, and fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue, net of the impact of freezing pension benefits, in each case related primarily to the acquisition of Pall Corporation and incurred in the year ended December 31, 2015 ($127 million pretax as presented in this line item, $99 million after-tax). The Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company's larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for the Company in a given period.

G Acquisition-related transaction costs deemed significant ($12 million pretax as presented in this line item, $9 million after-tax), change in control payments and restructuring costs ($49 million pretax as presented in this line item, $30 million after-tax), and fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue ($23 million pretax as presented in this line item, $14 million after-tax), in each case related primarily to the acquisition of Cepheid and incurred in the three months and year ended December 31, 2016. 

H This line item reflects the aggregate tax effect of all nontax adjustments reflected in the table above. In addition, the footnotes above indicate the after-tax amount of each individual adjustment item. Danaher estimates the tax effect of the adjustment items identified in the reconciliation schedule above by applying Danaher's overall estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount, unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment, in which case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment.

I Discrete income tax gains net of discrete income tax charges incurred in the three months ($41 million) and the year ($58 million) ended December 31, 2015.

J Discrete income tax gains net of discrete income tax charges incurred in the three months ended December 31, 2016 ($190 million). Discrete income tax gains net of discrete income tax charges and Fortive Corporation separation-related tax costs related to repatriation of earnings and legal entity realignments incurred in the year ended December 31, 2016 ($91 million).

Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures

Each of the non-GAAP measures set forth above should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing Danaher Corporation's ("Danaher" or the "Company") results that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, help our investors to:

• (with respect to the non-GAAP profitability measures) understand the long-term profitability trends of our business and compare our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers; and 

• (with respect to the non-GAAP revenue measures) identify underlying growth trends in our business and compare our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers.

The items excluded from the non-GAAP profitability and revenue measures set forth above have been excluded for the following reasons: 

• (with respect to the non-GAAP profitability measures) we exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe however that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation and that intangible asset amortization related to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. With respect to the other items excluded from the non-GAAP profitability measures, we exclude these items because they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency, occur for reasons that may be unrelated to Danaher's commercial performance during the period and/or we believe are not indicative of Danaher's ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period. With respect to each of the items excluded from the non-GAAP profitability measures, we believe that such items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. 

• (with respect to the non-GAAP revenue measures) (1) we exclude the impact of currency translation because it is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and (2) we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divested product lines because the nature, size and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
