CBS Radio Now Presented in Discontinued Operations

NEW YORK, February 15, 2017 - CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS.A and CBS) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016. 

“2016 was a phenomenal year for the CBS Corporation, with all-time highs in revenue, operating income, and EPS that came in above $4 for the first time in our Company’s history; and as we begin 2017, I couldn’t be more excited about our growth prospects in the years ahead,” said Leslie Moonves, Chairman and CEO, CBS Corporation. “We are already exceeding our projections to generate billions of dollars in incremental revenue, thanks to our new, fast-growing revenue sources and the strength of our base business. At the CBS Television Network, we are on track to be #1 for the ninth year in a row and 14 out of the past 15 years. And with ownership in more than 80% of our primetime lineup, the opportunities to monetize our hit shows across platforms and around the world have never been better. Meanwhile, annual revenue from retransmission consent and reverse compensation has already exceeded $1 billion, a full year ahead of schedule, and continues to grow rapidly. We are also taking advantage of the emergence of digital MVPDs through recent deals with Hulu and others at improved economic terms. Plus, our over-the-top subscription streaming services are contributing more meaningfully to our results all the time, and we have yet to launch The Good Fight and Star Trek: Discovery on CBS All Access and Twin Peaks on Showtime OTT here in 2017. In addition, we recently announced a deal to split-off our radio business in the best possible way through a tax-free transaction with Entercom. When completed, this transaction will allow us to focus even more on our core content strength and enable our faster-growing revenue to drive our results like never before. Across the board, our strategy of creating the best content, and distributing it in all the ways consumers want it, continues to position CBS to succeed no matter how the world changes.” 

Fourth Quarter 2016 Results

Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $3.52 billion compared with $3.59 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, which included a significant international licensing agreement for Showtime content as well as three additional Thursday Night Football games. Affiliate and subscription fee revenues increased 13%, led by growth in retransmission revenues, fees from CBS Television Network affiliated stations, and digital distribution services. Advertising revenues decreased 3% and were affected by having three fewer Thursday Night Football games than the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as lower ratings from the broadcast of NFL games in the fourth quarter of 2016. At the same time, advertising also benefited during the quarter from political spending at our local television stations. 

Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $484 million compared with $770 million for the same prior-year period. Comparability was affected by a one-time pension settlement charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a gain from the sale of an internet business in China in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating income of $733 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 grew 10% from $664 million for the same prior-year period, primarily reflecting growth from high-margin revenues, including political advertising, retransmission revenues, and fees from CBS Television Network affiliated stations. 

Net earnings from continuing operations were $271 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with $507 million for the same quarter last year, which included the previously mentioned discrete items. The Company reported a net loss of $113 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with net earnings of $261 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Both periods included impairment charges at CBS Radio, which has been presented in discontinued operations. Adjusted net earnings increased 9% to $476 million from $436 million for the same prior-year period, driven by the higher adjusted operating income. 

Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $.63 compared with $1.07 for the same quarter in 2015. EPS was a loss of $.26 for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with EPS of $.55 for the fourth quarter of 2015, which for both periods included the above-mentioned discrete items. Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2016 grew 21% to $1.11 from $.92 for the same prior-year period, driven by the higher adjusted net earnings and lower weighted average shares outstanding. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 25.4 million of its shares for $1.5 billion.

Details of the discrete items excluded from adjusted results, along with reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to reported results, are included at the end of this earnings release.

Pension Settlement 

In September 2016, the Company offered eligible former employees the option to make a one-time election to receive the present value of their pension benefits as a lump-sum distribution. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a one-time settlement charge of $211 million, reflecting the accelerated recognition of unamortized losses in the pension plan in proportion to the obligation that was settled.

CBS Radio Separation

On February 2, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to merge CBS Radio with a subsidiary of Entercom Communications Corp. In connection with the transaction, which is expected to be tax-free to CBS Corporation and its stockholders, the Company intends to split-off CBS Radio through an exchange offer immediately prior to the merger. The merger will create a well-capitalized company with a market cap in excess of $2 billion, a strong balance sheet, significant free cash flow, and the ability to pay an attractive dividend. The combined company is expected to generate meaningful cost synergies within 12-18 months after the merger. The Company expects to complete the transaction in the second half of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions. CBS Radio has been presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. 

Free Cash Flow

For the fourth quarter of 2016, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $337 million compared with $671 million for the same prior-year period, and for the 2016 full year, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $1.45 billion compared with $1.19 billion for 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2016, free cash flow was $252 million compared with $588 million for the same prior-year period, and for the 2016 full year, free cash flow was $1.26 billion compared with $1.02 billion in 2015. The increases for the full year were driven by growth in affiliate and subscription fees and higher advertising revenues, including from the broadcast of Super Bowl 50 on CBS, and were partially offset by increased investment in content.

Full Year 2016 Results

Full year 2016 revenues were $13.17 billion, up 4% from $12.67 billion in 2015. The growth was driven by an 8% increase in advertising revenues, led by the broadcast of Super Bowl 50 on CBS and record political advertising in 2016. Affiliate and subscription fees were up 9%, reflecting higher retransmission revenues and fees from CBS Television Network affiliated stations, which together were up 35%, as well as growth in digital distribution services. These increases were partially offset by the benefit to 2015 from Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Mayweather/Pacquiao boxing event. Content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 6%, reflecting a difficult comparison with the prior year, which included significant licensing sales of NCIS and Elementary.

Operating income was $2.62 billion for 2016 compared with $2.66 billion for 2015. Operating income for 2016 included a pension settlement charge, and for 2015, operating income included gains on the sales of internet businesses in China. Adjusted operating income of $2.86 billion in 2016 increased 12% from $2.56 billion in 2015, mainly reflecting the revenue growth. 

Net earnings from continuing operations were $1.55 billion for both 2016 and 2015, which included the previously mentioned discrete items. Net earnings were $1.26 billion for 2016 compared with $1.41 billion for 2015. Net earnings for both periods included impairment charges at CBS Radio, which has been presented in discontinued operations. Adjusted net earnings grew 14% to $1.84 billion for 2016 from $1.62 billion for 2015, principally because of the growth in adjusted operating income. 

EPS from continuing operations for 2016 was $3.46 compared with $3.18 for 2015. EPS was $2.81 for 2016 compared with $2.89 for 2015, which for both periods included the above-mentioned discrete items. Adjusted EPS for 2016 was $4.11, up 24% from $3.31 for 2015, driven by the higher adjusted net earnings and lower weighted average shares outstanding. During 2016, the Company repurchased 54.3 million of its shares for $3.0 billion.

Details of the discrete items excluded from adjusted results, along with reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to reported results, are included at the end of this earnings release.

Entertainment (CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International, CBS Television Distribution, CBS Interactive, and CBS Films) 

Entertainment revenues of $2.39 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016 decreased 3% from $2.46 billion for the same prior-year period. Entertainment advertising revenues decreased 8%, primarily because of having three fewer Thursday Night Football games than the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as lower ratings from the broadcast of NFL games in the fourth quarter of 2016. Affiliate and subscription fees were up 28% for the quarter, led by higher station affiliation fees and subscription growth at CBS All Access.

Entertainment operating income of $371 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 7% from $347 million for the same prior-year period, primarily reflecting growth from high-margin revenues, including station affiliation fees, as well as lower sports programming costs from the broadcast of fewer Thursday Night Football games.

Cable Networks (Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network, and Smithsonian Networks)

Cable Networks revenues were $501 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with $562 million for the same quarter in 2015, which included a multiyear international licensing agreement in Europe and the domestic sale of House of Lies. Growth from the Showtime digital streaming subscription offering partially offset this decline. 

Cable Networks operating income was $219 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with $228 million for the same prior-year period, primarily reflecting the lower revenues, which was offset by lower programming costs.

Publishing (Simon & Schuster)

Publishing operating income of $36 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 6% from $34 million for the same prior-year period, as lower production costs offset the decline in revenues. 

Local Media (CBS Television Stations)

Local Media revenues rose 16% to $526 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 from $454 million for the same prior-year period. The growth was led by record political advertising sales from federal and state elections and 9% growth in retransmission and subscription revenues. 

Local Media operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $216 million grew 45% from $149 million for the same prior-year period, primarily reflecting the higher revenues. 

Corporate

Adjusted Operating Income and Segment Operating Income

The following tables set forth the Company’s Adjusted Operating Income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company defines “Adjusted Operating Income” as operating income excluding a pension settlement charge, restructuring and merger and acquisition-related costs, and other operating items, net, each where applicable. For each individual reportable segment Adjusted Operating Income is also known as “Segment Operating Income.” The Company presents Segment Operating Income as the primary measure of profit and loss for its reportable segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance for segment reporting. 

The Company uses Adjusted Operating Income (or Segment Operating Income for each segment), as well as Adjusted Operating Income Margin, to, among other things, evaluate the Company’s operating performance, to value prospective acquisitions and as one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. These measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of the Company’s operational strength and business performance. The Company believes these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management, help improve investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating performance, and make it easier for investors to compare the Company’s results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. In addition, these are among the primary measures used externally by the Company’s investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and for the comparison of the Company’s operating performance to other companies in its industry, and to compare the Company’s year-over-year results.

Because Adjusted Operating Income is a measure of performance not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income or net earnings as an indicator of operating performance. Adjusted Operating Income, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, this measure does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company’s ability to fund its cash needs. As Adjusted Operating Income excludes certain financial information that is included in operating income and net earnings, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are excluded. The Company provides the following reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Income to operating income and net earnings.

Free Cash Flow

The Company defines free cash flow as its net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations and less capital expenditures. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company’s operations. The Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company’s ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company’s underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by the Company’s investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of the Company’s operating performance to other companies in its industry.

As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use, and is not necessarily a measure of the Company’s ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected in free cash flow.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow:

2016 and 2015 Adjusted Results

The following tables reconcile adjusted financial results to the reported results included in this earnings release. The Company believes that adjusting its financial results for the impact of these items is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management; provides a clearer perspective on the underlying performance of the Company; makes it easier for investors, analysts, and peers to compare the Company’s operating performance to other companies in its industry; and adjusting each period’s results on the same basis makes it easier to compare the Company’s year-over-year results.
