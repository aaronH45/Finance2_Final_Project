For the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, net income was $612.6 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, versus $749.9 million, or $2.13 per diluted share, for the comparable 2015 period.

“We finished the year strong and delivered fourth-quarter and full-year results that exceeded the upper-end of our guidance,” said Donald W.

You should read the following information in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 (when filed). All amounts below are in millions and as a percentage of our revenue, except per share data.

REVENUE

The following table reflects our total revenue by line of business for the three months and years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following table reflects changes in components of our revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, for the three months and years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average yield is defined as revenue growth from the change in average price per unit of service, expressed as a percentage. Core price is defined as price increases to our customers and fees, excluding fuel recovery, net of price decreases to retain customers. We also measure changes in average yield and core price as a percentage of related-business revenue, defined as total revenue excluding recycled commodities and fuel recovery fees, to determine the effectiveness of our pricing strategies. Average yield as a percentage of related-business revenue was 2.4% and 2.3% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively, and 2.4% and

2.6% for the same periods in 2015, respectively. Core price as a percentage of related-business revenue was 3.7% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, and 3.7% and 4.0% for the same periods in 2015, respectively. 

COST OF OPERATIONS

The following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the three months and years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

RECONCILIATION OF CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURES

EBITDA

The following table calculates EBITDA, which is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), for the three months and years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We believe that presenting EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides important information concerning our operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash and other costs. EBITDA demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy, which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends, repurchasing our common stock, and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization. This measure has limitations. Although depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs generally associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years. Our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Adjusted Earnings

Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.55 and $1.78 for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 versus $0.49 and $2.13 for the comparable 2015 periods. During the three months and years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a number of charges, other expenses and benefits that impacted our EBITDA, pre-tax income, net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. (net income – Republic) and diluted earnings per share. These items primarily consist of the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Line items in this column do not total to $0.57 per share due to rounding.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We believe that presenting adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income - Republic, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. We have incurred comparable charges and costs and have recorded similar recoveries in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. In the case of the Bridgeton insurance recovery, we are adjusting such amounts due to their significant effect on our operating results; however, in the ordinary course of our business, we often incur remediation charges and recoveries that we do not adjust from our operating results. Our definition of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income - Republic, and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 

Adjusted Free Cash Flow

The following table calculates our adjusted free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We believe that presenting adjusted free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after certain payments. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy and is a key metric we use to determine compensation. The presentation of adjusted free cash flow has material limitations. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or to which we have committed, such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the adjusted free cash flow presented above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected

on our consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period follows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, accounts receivable were $994.8 million and $962.9 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $44.0 million and $46.7 million, respectively, resulting in days sales outstanding of 38, or 26 days net of deferred revenue, for 2016 and 2015.

CASH DIVIDENDS

In October 2016, we paid a cash dividend of $109.0 million to shareholders of record as of October 3, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we recorded a dividend payable of $108.6 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 3, 2017, which was paid on January 16, 2017. 

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

During the three months ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our stock for $88.1 million at a weighted average cost per share of $51.08. 

As of December 31, 2016, we had 339.4 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share

The following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ending December 31, 2017 compared to the actual adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes restructuring charges and withdrawal costs - multiemployer pension funds, provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use this measure, and believe investors will find it helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. We have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow

Our anticipated adjusted free cash flow for the year ending December 31, 2017, and our actual adjusted free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2016, which are not measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are calculated as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period is as follows:

We believe that presenting adjusted free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after certain expenditures.

14
