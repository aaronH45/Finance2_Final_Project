Item 1.01.  

Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.    

On February 1, 2017, Kimco Realty Corporation (the “Company”) amended and restated its unsecured revolving credit facility and upsized the facility to $2,250,000,000 by entering into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), among the Company, the subsidiaries of the Company from time to time parties thereto, the several banks, financial institutions and other entities from time to time party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other parties thereto. 

Interest on borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrues at a spread (currently 0.875%) to LIBOR or, at the Company’s option, a spread (currently 0.0%) to the base rate defined in the Credit Agreement, that in each case fluctuates in accordance with changes in the Company’s senior debt ratings. As part of this credit facility, the Company has a competitive bid option whereby the Company may auction requested borrowings to the bank group. In addition, a portion of the facility is available for borrowings in alternative currencies such as Canadian Dollars, Euros, Sterling or Japanese Yen. 

The credit facility is scheduled to expire on March 17, 2021, with two six-month extension options. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is subject to covenants requiring, among other things, the maintenance of (i) maximum indebtedness ratios and (ii) minimum interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. Currently, one wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company is a borrower under the Credit Agreement and is therefore permitted to borrow loans thereunder.  

The Company had $420 million drawn under the Credit Agreement as of February 1, 2017, including approximately $675,000 of outstanding letters of credit. 

The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1.02. 

Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.   

On January 30, 2017, the Company repaid the $250 million in term loans that were outstanding under the credit agreement, dated as of January 30, 2015, among the Company, the several banks, financial institutions and other entities from time to time party thereto, and PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders party thereto, and terminated the agreement. 

Item 2.03. 

Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.   

The information in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated into this Item 2.03 by reference.
