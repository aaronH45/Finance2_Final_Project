Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

We used certain non-GAAP financial measures in describing our performance above. We use EBITA (defined as earnings before interest, taxes and amortization of intangibles) and EBITA margin (defined as EBITA divided by revenue) as additional operating performance measures, which excludes the non-cash amortization expense of intangible assets (primarily consisting of amortization arising from acquisitions), because we believe it is a useful measure for investors to evaluate the performance of our businesses. The financial tables at the end of this document reconcile EBITA to the GAAP financial measure of net income for the periods presented. 

Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.
