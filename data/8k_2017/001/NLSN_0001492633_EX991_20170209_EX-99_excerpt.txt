NIELSEN REPORTS 4th QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2016 RESULTS 

New York, USA – February 9, 2017 – Nielsen Holdings plc (NYSE: NLSN) today announced fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. Revenues were $1,656 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, up 2.0%, or 3.4% on a constant currency basis, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenues were $6,309 million for the full year of 2016, up 2.2%, or 4.1% on a constant currency basis, compared to 2015. 

“While 2016 was a challenging year, our results reflect the resiliency of our business. We remain focused on our key strategic initiatives and we continue to drive productivity and efficiency in our operations,” said Mitch Barns, Chief Executive Officer of Nielsen. 

He continued, “In our Watch segment, our Total Audience Measurement initiative continued to excel, and we saw significant growth in adoption of its many components by both media buyers and sellers. With the approach of the 2017 Upfronts, our Total Audience system is ready to play a key role for our clients.” 

“In our Buy segment, emerging markets continued to deliver solid growth. In developed markets, especially the U.S., trends in the fast moving consumer goods industry put pressure on our business. In response, we’ve accelerated investment in our Connected System initiative, designed to drive speed and efficiency for our clients. We expect this to lead to a stronger, higher margin business for Nielsen over time,” Barns concluded. 

Fourth Quarter 2016 Operating Results 

Revenues within the Buy segment for the fourth quarter of 2016 decreased 1.3% to $868 million, but increased 0.9% on a constant currency basis. Buy revenues in developed markets decreased 1.4%, but increased 0.4% on a constant currency basis, reflecting modest strength in Western Europe, partially offset by softness in our U.S. market. Buy emerging markets revenues increased 4.0%, or 7.2% on a constant currency basis, as our global footprint, coverage expansion, and broad product offerings continue to position us well with both local and multinational clients.  

Revenues within the Watch segment for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 5.8%, or 6.2% on a constant currency basis, to $788 million. Audience Measurement of Video and Text revenues increased 8.4%, or 9.0% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to our ongoing investments and continued client adoption of our Total Audience Measurement system. Audio revenues decreased 1.6% on a reported and constant currency basis. Marketing Effectiveness revenues increased by 6.4%, or 9.2% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued investments in our product portfolio.  

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 decreased 36.7% on a reported and constant currency basis to $159 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, due to gains of $206 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily associated with an increased stake in Nielsen Catalina Solutions that did not recur in 2016. Net income per share on a diluted basis decreased to $0.44 compared to $0.68 for the fourth quarter of 2015.  

Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 3.2%, or 3.8% on a constant currency basis, to $548 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins grew 39 basis points, or 13 basis points on a constant currency basis, to 33.1%, due to the benefit of our ongoing productivity initiatives and the operating leverage of the business.

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Operating Results 

Revenues for the full year increased 2.2%, or 4.1% on a constant currency basis, to $6,309 million, compared to 2015.  

Revenues within the Buy segment decreased 0.7% to $3,322 million, but increased 2.3% on a constant currency basis. Buy revenues in developed markets decreased 0.7%, but increased 0.9% on a constant currency basis reflecting modest strength in Western Europe, partially offset by softness in our U.S. market. Buy emerging markets revenues increased 1.8%, or 8.6% on a constant currency basis, driven by our continued commitment to invest in coverage, which resulted in broad based demand for our services with both our multinational and local clients.  

Revenues within the Watch segment increased 5.7%, or 6.3% on a constant currency basis, to $2,987 million. Audience Measurement of Video and Text revenues increased 7.5%, or 8.3% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to our ongoing investments and continued client adoption of our Total Audience Measurement system. Audio revenues decreased 0.8%, or 0.6% on a constant currency basis. Marketing Effectiveness revenues increased 14.3%, or 16.2% on a constant currency basis, due to our continued investments in our product portfolio and clients’ growing demand for our advertising ROI and precision targeting tools.  

Net income for the year decreased 11.9%, or 11.2% on a constant currency basis, to $502 million, compared to 2015, as gains of $206 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015 did not recur in 2016, and higher restructuring charges were partially offset by solid operating earnings. Net income per share on a diluted basis was $1.39, compared to $1.54 in 2015.  

Adjusted EBITDA for the year increased 4.3%, or 5.2% on a constant currency basis, to $1,938 million, compared to 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins grew 62 basis points, or 31 basis points on a constant currency basis, to 30.7%, due to the benefit of our ongoing productivity initiatives and the operating leverage of the business.  

Financial Position 

As of December 31, 2016, Nielsen’s cash and cash equivalents were $754 million and gross debt was $7,926 million. Net debt (gross debt less cash and cash equivalents) was $7,172 million and our net debt leverage ratio was 3.70x at the end of 2016. Net capital expenditures were $391 million for the full year of 2016, compared to $401 million for the full year of 2015. Cash taxes were $157 million for the full year of 2016, compared to $159 million for the full year of 2015. 

Cash flow from operations increased to $1,296 million for the full year of 2016 from $1,209 million in 2015. Free cash flow for the full year of 2016 increased to $941 million, compared to $808 million in 2015. Cash flow performance was driven by our continued focus on working capital, and lower net capital expenditures.  

In January 2017, Nielsen completed the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% Senior Notes due 2025. The company intends to apply the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital and redemption or repayment of debt, and to fund a portion of the purchase price for its previously announced acquisition of Gracenote from Tribune Media Company, which closed on February 1, 2017.  

Capital Allocation 

The company repurchased $418 million of shares of its common stock during the full year of 2016. The company has a total of $438 million remaining for repurchase under the existing share repurchase program.

Results of Operations—(Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015)  

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amounts included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)Depreciation and amortization associated with tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations were $52 million and $210 million, respectively, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and $53 million and $205 million, respectively, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015.  

Certain Non-GAAP Measures  

We use the non-GAAP financial measures discussed below to evaluate our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and indebtedness. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations, cash flows and indebtedness and that when this non-GAAP financial information is viewed with our GAAP financial information, investors are provided with valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and is consistent with how management evaluates the company’s operating performance and liquidity. In addition, these non-GAAP measures address questions the Company routinely receives from analysts and investors and, in order to assure that all investors have access to similar data the Company has determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. None of the non-GAAP measures presented should be considered as an alternative to net income or loss, operating income or loss, cash flows from operating activities, total indebtedness or any other measures of operating performance and financial condition, liquidity or indebtedness derived in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our use of these terms may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by others in our industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation.

Exhibit 99.1 

Constant Currency Presentation  

We evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and is consistent with how management evaluates the company’s performance. We calculate constant currency percentages by converting our prior-period local currency financial results using the current period exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current period reported results. No adjustment has been made to foreign currency exchange transaction gains or losses in the calculation of constant currency net income. 

The below table presents a reconciliation from revenue on a reported basis to revenue on a constant currency basis for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Adjusted EBITDA 

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss from our consolidated statements of operations before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, stock-based compensation expense and other non-operating items from our consolidated statements of operations as well as certain other items that arise outside the ordinary course of our continuing operations specifically described below.

Exhibit 99.1 

Restructuring charges: We exclude restructuring expenses, which primarily include employee severance, office consolidation and contract termination charges, from our Adjusted EBITDA to allow more accurate comparisons of the financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. By excluding these expenses from our non-GAAP measures, management is better able to evaluate our ability to utilize our existing assets and estimate the long-term value these assets will generate for us. Furthermore, we believe that the adjustments of these items more closely correlate with the sustainability of our operating performance. 

Stock-based compensation: We exclude the impact of costs relating to stock-based compensation. Due to the subjective assumptions and a variety of award types, we believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense, which is typically non-cash, allows for more meaningful comparisons of operating results to peer companies. Stock-based compensation expense can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted. 

Other non-operating expenses, net: We exclude foreign currency exchange transaction gains and losses primarily related to intercompany financing arrangements as well as other non-operating income and expense items, such as, gains and losses recorded on business combinations or dispositions, sales of investments and early redemption payments made in connection with debt refinancing. We believe that the adjustments of these items more closely correlate with the sustainability of our operating performance. 

Other items: To measure operating performance, we exclude certain expenses that arise outside the ordinary course of our continuing operations. Such costs primarily include legal settlements, acquisition related expenses, business optimization costs and other transaction costs. We believe the exclusion of such amounts allows management and the users of the financial statements to better understand our financial results. 

Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our use of the term Adjusted EBITDA may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by others in our industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation.  

We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our performance from period to period both at the consolidated level as well as within our operating segments, to evaluate and fund incentive compensation programs and to compare our results to those of our competitors. In addition to Adjusted EBITDA being a significant measure of performance for management purposes, we also believe that this presentation provides useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations and that when non-GAAP financial information is viewed with GAAP financial information, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance.  

Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or cash flows as measures of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. 

The below table presents reconciliations from net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

Exhibit 99.1 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, other items primarily consist of business optimization costs. 

Free Cash Flow  

We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, plus contributions to the Nielsen Foundation, less capital expenditures, net. We believe providing free cash flow information provides valuable supplemental liquidity information regarding the cash flow that may be available for discretionary use by us in areas such as the distributions of dividends, repurchase of common stock, voluntary repayment of debt obligations or to fund our strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, if any. However, free cash flow does not represent residual cash flows entirely available for discretionary purposes; for example, the repayment of principal amounts borrowed is not deducted from free cash flow. Key limitations of the free cash flow measure include the assumptions that we will be able to refinance our existing debt when it matures and meet other cash flow obligations from financing activities, such as principal payments on debt. Free cash flow is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:

Exhibit 99.1 

Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage Ratio  

The net debt leverage ratio is defined as net debt (gross debt less cash and cash equivalents) as of the balance sheet date divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months then ended. Net debt and the net debt leverage ratio are commonly used metrics to evaluate and compare leverage between companies and are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP. The calculation of net debt and the net debt leverage ratio as of December 31, 2016 is as follows:
