On January 31, 2017, Nasdaq, Inc. (“Nasdaq”) issued a press release providing financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of 2016. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.  

 Item 2.06. Material Impairments.  

On January 30, 2017, Nasdaq’s board of directors approved a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $578 million for the write-off of the eSpeed trade name following the rebranding of the U.S. Treasury business in conjunction with new leadership and an evolution of the strategy to better respond to continued business challenges. The charge did not impact the company’s consolidated cash flows, liquidity or capital resources. Nasdaq does not expect that this charge will result in material future cash expenditures.
