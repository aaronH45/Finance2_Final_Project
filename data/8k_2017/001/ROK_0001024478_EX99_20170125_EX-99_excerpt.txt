 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Diluted EPS of $1.65; Adjusted EPS of $1.75

•Increasing fiscal 2017 EPS guidance: Diluted EPS $5.56 - $5.96; Adjusted EPS $5.95 - $6.35

MILWAUKEE (January 25, 2017) — Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK) today reported fiscal 2017 first quarter sales of $1,490.3 million, up 4.5 percent from $1,426.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Organic sales grew 3.8 percent. Currency translation reduced sales by 1.1 percentage points, and acquisitions contributed 1.8 percentage points to sales growth.

Fiscal 2017 first quarter net income was $214.7 million or $1.65 per share, compared to $185.5 million or $1.40 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2017 first quarter Adjusted EPS was $1.75, up 17 percent compared to $1.49 in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The increases in EPS and Adjusted EPS were primarily due to higher sales, strong margin performance and lower tax rates. 

Pre-tax margin increased to 17.3 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 16.6 percent in the same period last year. Total segment operating earnings were $316.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, up 7 percent from $295.9 million in the same period of fiscal 2016. Total segment operating margin was 21.2 percent compared to 20.7 percent a year ago. The increases in pre-tax margin and total segment operating margin were primarily due to higher sales and productivity, partially offset by higher incentive compensation.

Commenting on the results, Blake D. Moret, president and chief executive officer, said, “Four percent organic growth in the quarter is a great start to the fiscal year, better than we expected. We returned to organic growth in our largest market, the U.S., and we saw double-digit growth in emerging markets. I am also pleased with the contribution from recent acquisitions, along with our strong margin performance."

Outlook

Commenting on the outlook, Moret added, "The macro environment remains consistent with our assumptions earlier in the fiscal year. Oil and commodity prices have been stable or have inched up, and our business in these markets has been relatively flat now for a few quarters. Recent projections continue to call for improving GDP and Industrial Production growth rates, as well as a higher level of capital expenditures. We therefore expect continued growth in the consumer and transportation verticals, and expect heavy industry end markets to be about flat year over year.

"Taking the macro outlook and our strong first quarter into consideration, we are increasing full-year organic sales guidance by one point across the range, and increasing EPS guidance by ten cents across the range."

The following table provides updated guidance as it relates to sales growth and earnings per share for fiscal 2017:

Moret continued, “Strong underlying demand for our products enables us to accelerate investments this year in core technologies and domain expertise, and to expand the new value we are providing in Information Solutions and Connected Services. Together, these will further enhance our ability to bring The Connected Enterprise to life and profitably grow share at customers globally.

“I would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued dedication in serving our customers.”

Fiscal 2017 first quarter general corporate-net expense was $14.9 million compared to $18.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.

The Adjusted Effective Tax Rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was 18.1 percent compared to 22.8 percent a year ago. The decreases in the effective tax rate and the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate were primarily due to larger favorable discrete tax items in the current quarter compared to the prior year.

SALES AND EARNINGS INFORMATION

(in millions, except per share amounts and percentages)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1Total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures. We exclude purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, general corporate – net, non-operating pension costs, interest expense and income tax provision because we do not consider these costs to be directly related to the operating performance of our segments. We believe that these measures are useful to investors as measures of operating performance. We use these measures to monitor and evaluate the profitability of our Company. Our measures of total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin may be different from those used by other companies.

2Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP earnings measure that excludes the non-operating pension costs and their related income tax effects. See "Other Supplemental Information - Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate" section for more information regarding non-operating pension costs and a reconciliation to GAAP measures.

Organic Sales

Our press release contains information regarding organic sales, which we define as sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and/or acquisitions. We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. Sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.

The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to sales for the three months ended December 31, 2015:

Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate

Our press release contains financial information and earnings guidance regarding Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, which are non-GAAP earnings measures that exclude non-operating pension costs and their related income tax effects. We define non-operating pension costs as defined benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impact of any plan curtailments or settlements. These components of net periodic benefit cost primarily relate to changes in pension assets and liabilities that are a result of market performance; we consider these costs to be unrelated to the operating performance of our business. We believe that Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period. Adjusted EPS is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation. Our measures of Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate may be different from measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for income from continuing operations, diluted EPS and effective tax rate.

The following are the components of operating and non-operating pension costs for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

Free Cash Flow

Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we adopted a new share-based compensation accounting standard that requires the excess income tax benefit from share-based compensation to be classified as an operating, rather than as a financing, cash flow. In previous periods, we added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, no adjustment is necessary as this benefit is already included in operating cash flows. 

In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance, including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies.

The following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:

Return On Invested Capital

Our press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in our operations. We use ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance, including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation. Our measure of ROIC may be different from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:

(a) Income from continuing operations, before interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, for the most recent twelve months; divided by

(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners’ equity, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments; multiplied by

(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the twelve-month period.

ROIC is calculated and reconciled to GAAP measures as follows:
