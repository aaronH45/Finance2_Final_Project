   •   Full year 2016 pre-tax profit of $4.3 billion, or $5.1 billion excluding net special charges, and net profit of $2.7 billion, or $3.2 billion excluding net special charges

   •   Returned $606 million to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends in the fourth quarter, for a total of $4.6 billion in 2016. Announced a new $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization  

The Company reported a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net profit of $289 million, or $0.56 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2016. The Company’s fourth quarter 2016 results include a $211 million provision for income taxes, of which $207 million is non-cash due to net operating loss utilization. This compares to a GAAP net profit of $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter 2015, or $5.09 per diluted share, which included a non-cash $3.0 billion net special income tax benefit resulting from the reversal of the Company’s valuation allowance.  

The Company reported a full year 2016 GAAP net profit of $2.7 billion, or $4.81 per diluted share, including a non-cash income tax provision of $1.6 billion. This compares to a GAAP net profit of $7.6 billion in 2015, or $11.07 per diluted share, which included the $3.0 billion non-cash income tax benefit.  

The impact of the year-over-year change in non-cash income tax expense is removed by comparing pre-tax income. The Company reported a fourth quarter 2016 GAAP pre-tax income of $500 million, and pre-tax income excluding net special charges of $773 million. This compares to a fourth quarter 2015 GAAP pre-tax income of $244 million, and pre-tax income excluding net special charges of $1.3 billion. For the full year, the Company reported a 2016 GAAP pre-tax income of $4.3 billion, and pre-tax income excluding net special charges of $5.1 billion, which compares to a 2015 GAAP pre-tax income of $4.6 billion, and pre-tax income excluding net special charges of $6.3 billion.

Air Transport World named American as its 2017 Airline of the Year, citing our team’s integration work, operational and customer service improvements, and the significant investments we are making in our product. This recognition is entirely due to the great work of our 120,000 team members,” said Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO.  

“As we enter 2017, we will continue to make upgrades to American through new product initiatives. These include Basic Economy which will further our goal to offer the right fares and features for every customer, and, on international flights, our Premium Economy product. And no matter which product our customers choose, they’ll be transported on the youngest fleet among our large U.S. competitors.  

“Our product investments are showing up in our unit revenue performance. We had the largest improvement in unit revenue among our competitors and as we look forward, we continue to see strong demand for air service, and improving yields.”

Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Information to Non-GAAP Financial Information  

American Airlines Group Inc. (the “Company”) is providing the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors the ability to measure financial performance excluding special items, which is more indicative of the Company’s ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. The Company believes that the presentation of mainline and regional CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors because both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond the Company’s control. Management uses mainline and regional CASM excluding special items and fuel to evaluate the Company’s operating performance.

FOOTNOTES:  

 (1)  

The 2016 fourth quarter mainline operating special items totaled a net charge of $259 million, which principally included $119 million of merger integration expenses, $104 million of fleet restructuring expenses and a $47 million net charge consisting of fair value adjustments for bankruptcy obligations. The 2016 twelve month period mainline operating special items totaled a net charge of $709 million, which principally included $514 million of merger integration expenses, $177 million of fleet restructuring expenses and a $25 million net charge consisting of fair value adjustments for bankruptcy obligations. For 2016, merger integration expenses included costs related to information technology, re-branding of aircraft, airport facilities and uniforms, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, relocation, training and severance. Fleet restructuring expenses included the acceleration of aircraft depreciation, impairments, remaining lease payments and lease return costs for aircraft grounded earlier than planned.  

The 2015 fourth quarter mainline operating special items totaled a net charge of $441 million, which principally included $203 million of merger integration expenses, $92 million of fleet restructuring expenses and a $22 million net charge consisting of fair value adjustments for bankruptcy obligations. The 2015 twelve month period mainline operating special items totaled a net charge of $1.1 billion, which principally consisted of $826 million of merger integration expenses, $210 million of fleet restructuring expenses and a $53 million net credit consisting of fair value adjustments for bankruptcy obligations. For 2015, merger integration expenses included costs related to information technology, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance, relocation and training, re-branding of aircraft, airport facilities and uniforms, as well as share-based compensation. Fleet restructuring expenses included the acceleration of aircraft depreciation, impairments, remaining lease payments and lease return costs for aircraft grounded earlier than planned.  

 (2)  

The 2016 fourth quarter nonoperating special charges primarily consisted of debt issuance costs associated with a term loan refinancing. In addition to these term loan refinancing costs, the 2016 twelve month period nonoperating special charges included non-cash write offs of unamortized discounts and issuances costs, as well as payments of redemption premiums and fees, associated with a bond refinancing.  

The 2015 fourth quarter and twelve month period nonoperating special items totaled a net charge of $592 million and $594 million, respectively, and primarily consisted of a write off of all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by the Company due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela.  

 (3)  

In 2015, income tax special items totaled a net credit of $3.0 billion. In connection with the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for the fourth quarter of 2015, management determined that it was more likely than not that substantially all of its deferred tax assets, which include the Company’s net operating losses (NOLs), would be realized. Accordingly, the Company reversed $3.0 billion of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015, which resulted in a special $3.0 billion non-cash tax benefit recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for 2015.  

 (4)  

In 2015, there was no net tax effect associated with special items. During 2015, the Company’s net deferred tax asset, which includes its NOLs, was subject to a full valuation allowance. Accordingly, the Company’s NOLs offset its taxable income and resulted in the release of a corresponding portion of valuation allowance, which offset the tax provision dollar for dollar.  

 (5)  

As a result of the Company’s profitability and the reversal of the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets at December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a $211 million and $1.62 billion provision for income taxes in the 2016 fourth quarter and twelve month period, respectively. Of these amounts, $207 million and $1.61 billion in the 2016 fourth quarter and twelve month period, respectively, were non-cash due to the utilization of NOLs. For periods prior to 2016, the Company recognized a nominal tax provision for certain states and international jurisdictions where NOLs were limited or not available to be used. In addition, the Company recorded a $3.0 billion non-cash tax benefit in connection with the reversal of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015, as described above. Accordingly, amounts reported in the 2016 fourth quarter and twelve month period for income tax provision and net income are not comparable to the respective 2015 periods. The Company is presenting net income and earnings per share excluding special items and the non-cash income tax provision in order to provide more meaningful period-over-period comparisons.
