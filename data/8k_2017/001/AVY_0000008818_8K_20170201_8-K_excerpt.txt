“Safe Harbor” Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 

Certain statements contained in this report on Form 8-K and in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 are forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements, and financial or other business targets, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results and trends may differ materially from historical or anticipated results depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to risks and uncertainties relating to the following: fluctuations in demand affecting sales to customers; worldwide and local economic conditions; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and other risks associated with foreign operations, including in emerging markets; the financial condition and inventory strategies of customers; changes in customer preferences; fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials; the Company’s ability to generate sustained productivity improvement; the Company’s ability to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions; the impact of competitive products and pricing; loss of significant contracts or customers; collection of receivables from customers; selling prices; business mix shift; timely development and market acceptance of new products, including sustainable or sustainably-sourced products; investment in development activities and new production facilities; integration of acquisitions and completion of potential dispositions; amounts of future dividends and share repurchases; customer and supplier concentrations; successful implementation of new manufacturing technologies and installation of manufacturing equipment; disruptions in information technology systems, including cyber-attacks or other intrusions to network security; successful installation of new or upgraded information technology systems; data security breaches; volatility of financial markets; impairment of capitalized assets, including goodwill and other intangibles; credit risks; the Company’s ability to obtain adequate financing arrangements and maintain access to capital; fluctuations in interest and tax rates; changes in tax laws and regulations, and uncertainties associated with interpretations of such laws and regulations; outcome of tax audits; fluctuations in pension, insurance, and employee benefit costs; the impact of legal and regulatory proceedings, including with respect to environmental, health and safety; changes in governmental laws and regulations; protection and 

infringement of intellectual property; changes in political conditions; the impact of epidemiological events on the economy and the Company’s customers and suppliers; acts of war, terrorism, and natural disasters; and other factors. 

The Company believes that the most significant risk factors that could affect its financial performance in the near-term include: (1) the impacts of global economic conditions and political uncertainty on underlying demand for the Company’s products and foreign currency fluctuations; (2) competitors’ actions, including pricing, expansion in key markets, and product offerings; and (3) the degree to which higher costs can be offset with productivity measures and/or passed on to customers through selling price increases, without a significant loss of volume. 

For a more detailed discussion of these and other factors, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” in the Company’s 2015 Form 10-K, filed on February 24, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this Form 8-K are made only as of the date of this Form 8-K, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, other than as may be required by law.
