 Arconic Aerospace Cowen and Company 38th Annual Aerospace/Defense & Industrials Conference February 8th, 2017 Exhibit 99.1 

 Important Information Forward–Looking Statements This presentation contains statements that relate to future events and expectations and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include those containing such words as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “guidance,” “goal,” “intends,” “may,” “outlook,” “plans,” “projects,” “seeks,” “sees,” “should,” “targets,” “will,” “would,” or other words of similar meaning. All statements that reflect Arconic’s expectations, assumptions or projections about the future, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements and guidance regarding future financial results or operating performance; statements about Arconic’s strategies, outlook, business and financial prospects; and forecasts and expectations relating to end markets. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Although Arconic believes that the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that these expectations will be attained and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (a) deterioration in global economic and financial market conditions generally; (b) unfavorable changes in the markets served by Arconic; (c) the inability to achieve the level of revenue growth, cash generation, cost savings, improvement in profitability and margins, fiscal discipline, or strengthening of competitiveness and operations anticipated from restructuring programs and productivity improvement, cash sustainability, technology advancements, and other initiatives; (d) changes in discount rates or investment returns on pension assets; (e) Arconic’s inability to realize expected benefits, in each case as planned and by targeted completion dates, from acquisitions, divestitures, facility closures, curtailments, expansions, or joint ventures; (f) the impact of cyber attacks and potential information technology or data security breaches; (g) political, economic, and regulatory risks in the countries in which Arconic operates or sells products; (h) the impact of the separation on the businesses of Arconic; (i) material adverse changes in aluminum industry conditions, including fluctuations in London Metal Exchange-based aluminum prices; (j) the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on costs and results; (k) the outcome of contingencies, including legal proceedings, government or regulatory investigations, and environmental remediation; and (l) the other risk factors discussed in Arconic’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Arconic disclaims any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Market projections are subject to the risks discussed above and other risks in the market. 

 Important Information (continued) Non-GAAP Financial Measures Some of the information included in this presentation is derived from Arconic’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in Arconic’s financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. These non-GAAP financial measures supplement our GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to the GAAP measure. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and management’s rationale for the use of the non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Appendix to this presentation. Arconic has not provided a reconciliation of any forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because Arconic is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, and Arconic believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. In particular, reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, Return on Net Assets, adjusted net income, and Free Cash Flow to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges and other components excluded from these non-GAAP measures, such as the effects of foreign currency movements, equity income, gains or losses on sales of assets, taxes and any future restructuring or impairment charges. These reconciling items are in addition to the inherent variability already included in the GAAP measures, which includes, but is not limited to, price/mix and volume. Any reference to historical EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA, for which we have provided calculations and reconciliations in the Appendix. Background and Other Information On November 1, 2016, Alcoa Inc. separated into two standalone companies – Arconic Inc. (the new name for Alcoa Inc.) and Alcoa Corporation. The pre-separation historical results for the businesses that now comprise Alcoa Corporation – the former Alcoa Inc. Alumina and Primary Metals segments along with the rolling mill operations in Warrick, Indiana and Saudi Arabia, which were previously part of the Global Rolled Products (GRP) segment – are presented as discontinued operations in Arconic’s financial results for all periods. References in this presentation to “combined segments” reflect the combined performance of Arconic’s three segments – Engineered Products and Solutions (EPS), GRP (which does not include the Warrick, IN and Saudi Arabia rolling mill operations, as noted above), and Transportation and Construction Solutions (TCS). Tennessee Packaging (or “Tenn pkg”) ramp down – Arconic expects to fully exit the North America packaging business at its Tennessee operations following the expiration of the toll processing and services agreement with Alcoa Corporation on December 31, 2018, unless sooner terminated by the parties.

 Reconciliation of Adjusted Income S101 (in millions, except per-share amounts) Income Diluted EPS(6) Year ended Year ended December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2015 2016 2015 2016 Net loss attributable to Arconic $(322) $(931) $(0.93) $(2.28) Discontinued operations(1) 165 (121) Special items(2): Restructuring and other charges 214 155 Discrete tax items(3) 216 1,280 Other special items(4) 39 196 Tax impact(5) (14) (74) Noncontrolling interests impact(5) - - Net income attributable to Arconic – as adjusted $298 $505 $0.54 $0.98 Net loss attributable to Arconic – as adjusted is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of Arconic excluding the impacts of restructuring and other charges, discrete tax items, and other special items (collectively, “special items”). There can be no assurances that additional special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both Net loss attributable to Arconic determined under GAAP as well as Net income attributable to Arconic – as adjusted. (1)On November 1, 2016, the former Alcoa Inc. was separated into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, by means of a pro rata distribution of 80.1 percent of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation to Alcoa Inc. shareholders. Accordingly, the results of operations of Alcoa Corporation have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  

 Reconciliation of Adjusted Income, continued S101 (2) In the second quarter of 2016, management changed the manner in which special items are presented in Arconic’s reconciliation of Adjusted Income. This change resulted in special items being presented on a pretax basis and the related tax and noncontrolling interest’s impacts on special items being aggregated into separate respective line items. The special items for the year ended December 31, 2015 was updated to conform to the current period presentation. (3)Discrete tax items include the following: for the year ended December 31, 2015, a charge for valuation allowances related to certain deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Iceland ($190), a net charge for other valuation allowances and for a number of small items ($26); and for the year ended December 31, 2016, a charge for valuation allowances related to the November 1, 2016 separation (see Note 1 above)($1,267), a net charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets due to tax rate and tax law changes ($51), a net benefit for certain valuation allowances not associated with the separation ($18), and a net benefit for a number of small items ($20). (4)Other special items include the following: for the year ended December 31, 2015, costs associated with the acquisitions of RTI International Metals and Tital ($28), an impairment of goodwill related to the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil ($25) costs associated with the planned separation of Alcoa ($24), a gain on the sale of land ($19), and a gain on the sale of an equity investment in a China rolling mill ($19); and for the year ended December 31, 2016, costs associated with the planned separation of Alcoa ($205), unfavorable tax costs associated with the redemption of Company-owned life insurance policies ($100), a favorable adjustment to the contingent earn-out liability and a post-closing adjustment which both related to the November 2014 acquisition of Firth Rixson ($76), a favorable tax benefit related to the currency impacts of a distribution of previously taxed income ($49), and unfavorable tax costs associated with the sale of a U.S. subsidiary with book goodwill ($16). (5)The tax impact on special items is based on the applicable statutory rates whereby the difference between such rates and Arconic’s consolidated estimated annual effective tax rate is itself a special item (see footnote 2 above). The noncontrolling interests impact on special items represents Arconic’s partners’ share of certain special items. (6)At a special meeting of Arconic common shareholders held on October 5, 2016, shareholders approved a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of Arconic’s outstanding and authorized shares of common stock which became effective on October 6, 2016. All share and per share data for all periods presented have been updated to reflect the reverse stock split. The average number of shares applicable to diluted EPS for Net income attributable to Arconic common shareholders excludes certain share equivalents as their effect was anti-dilutive. However, certain of these share equivalents may become dilutive in the EPS calculation applicable to Net income attributable to Arconic common shareholders – as adjusted due to a larger and/or positive numerator. Specifically: for the year ended December 31, 2015, share equivalents associated with employee stock options and awards were dilutive based on Net income attributable to Arconic common shareholders – as adjusted, resulting in a diluted average number of shares of 424,628,747; and for the year ended December 31, 2016, share equivalents associated with both outstanding employee stock options and awards and convertible notes related to the acquisition of RTI International Metals were dilutive based on Net income attributable to Arconic common shareholders-as adjusted, resulting in a diluted average number of shares of 453,118,372 (after-tax interest expense of $9 needs to be added back to the numerator since the convertible notes were dilutive).

Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation and amortization. The Other line in the table above includes gains/losses on asset sales and other non-operating items. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information with respect to Arconic’s operating performance and the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations. The Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

(1) Excludes the Warrick, IN rolling operations and the equity interest in the rolling mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia, both of which were previously part of the Global Rolled Products segment but became part of Alcoa Corporation effective November 1, 2016 (2) Includes 54 thousand metric tons (kmt) for the Tennessee packaging business, both for the 2016 fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2016. This amount represents the volume at Arconic’s Tennessee operations associated with the toll processing and services agreement that Arconic and Alcoa Corporation entered into in connection with the separation of the companies. Pursuant to this agreement, this amount is not reported in Arconic’s shipments but has been included in the calculation for adjusted EBITDA / Total shipments for historical comparative purposes.

The Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. (1)On November 1, 2016, Alcoa Inc. completed its separation into two standalone, publicly-traded companies. Arconic includes the former Alcoa Inc. segments: Engineered Products and Solutions, Transportation and Construction Solutions, and Global Rolled Products, except for the Warrick, IN rolling operations and the equity interest in the rolling mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia which both became part of Alcoa Corporation. The Global Rolled Products segment information has been updated to exclude the Warrick, IN rolling operations and the equity interest in the rolling mill at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia.

Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information with respect to Arconic’s operating performance and the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations. The Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. (1)On November 1, 2016, the former Alcoa Inc. was separated into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, by means of a pro rata distribution of 80.1 percent of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation to Alcoa Inc. shareholders. Accordingly, the results of operations of Alcoa Corporation have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  

 Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow(1) S101 (in millions) Year ended Quarter ended December 31, 2012(1) December 31, 2013(1) December 31, 2014(1) December 31, 2015(1) December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015(1) September 30, 2016(1) December 31, 2016 Cash from operations $1,497 $1,578 $1,674 $1,582 $873 $865 $306 $665 Capital expenditures (1,261) (1,193) (1,219) (1,180) (1,125) (398) (286) (311) Free cash flow $236 $385 $455 $402 $(252) $467 $20 $354 Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures due to the fact that these expenditures are considered necessary to maintain and expand Arconic’s asset base and are expected to generate future cash flows from operations. It is important to note that Free Cash Flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements, are not deducted from the measure. (1)On November 1, 2016, the former Alcoa Inc. was separated into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, by means of a pro rata distribution of 80.1 percent of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation to Alcoa Inc. shareholders. Cash from operations and capital expenditures for Alcoa Corporation have not been segregated and are included in this table for all periods prior to November 1, 2016.

Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management assesses Arconic’s leverage position after factoring in available cash that could be used to repay outstanding debt. (1)On November 1, 2016, the former Alcoa Inc. was separated into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, by means of a pro rata distribution of 80.1 percent of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation to Alcoa Inc. shareholders. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of Alcoa Corporation have been reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations for all periods presented and therefore are not included in this table. (2)In the first quarter of 2016, Arconic adopted changes issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to the presentation of debt issuance costs, which require such costs to be classified as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the related debt liability on an entity’s balance sheet. As such, all debt issuance costs were classified as a contra liability in the Long-term debt, less amount due within one year line item in the 2016 period presented in the table above. These changes are required to be applied on a retrospective basis; therefore, all periods prior to 2016 presented in the table above were updated to conform to the presentation of the 2016 periods. As a result, $85, $73, $65, and $51 of debt issuance costs were reflected as deductions in the Long-term debt, less amount due within one year line item for 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively.

Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because Adjusted EBITDA, excluding separation costs, provides additional information with respect to Arconic’s operating performance and the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations excluding the one time costs of separation. On November 1, 2016, the former Alcoa Inc. was separated into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, by means of a pro rata distribution of 80.1% of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation to Alcoa Inc. shareholders. Accordingly, the results of operations of Alcoa Corporation have been reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented. See Reconciliation of Arconic Adjusted EBITDA for the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.

RONA is calculated as adjusted net income divided by working capital and net PP&E. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors as RONA helps management and investors determine the percentage of net income the company is generating from its assets. This ratio tells how effectively and efficiently the company is using its assets to generate earnings. (1)On November 1, 2016, the former Alcoa Inc. was separated into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, by means of a pro rata distribution of 80.1% of the outstanding common stock of Alcoa Corporation to Alcoa Inc. shareholders. Accordingly, the results of operations of Alcoa Corporation have been reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented. (2) See Reconciliation of Adjusted Income for a description of special items for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. (3)The Deferred purchase price receivable relates to an arrangement to sell certain customer receivables to several financial institutions on a recurring basis. Arconic is adding back the receivable for the purposes of the Working Capital calculation.
