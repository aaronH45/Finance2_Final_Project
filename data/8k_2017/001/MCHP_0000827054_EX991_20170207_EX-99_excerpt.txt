Page 2

GAAP net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were $834.4 million, up 54.4% from GAAP net sales of $540.3 million in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. GAAP net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was $107.3 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, up from GAAP net income of $61.2 million, or 28 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's third fiscal quarter.

Non-GAAP net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were $881.2 million, up 59.6% from non-GAAP net sales of $552.0 million in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was $246.5 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, up 78.1% from non-GAAP net income of $138.4 million, or 64 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of discontinued operations, share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), preclusion of revenue recognition under GAAP for inventory in the distribution channel on the acquisition dates of our acquisitions, revenue recognition changes related to Atmel and Micrel distributors, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, gains on equity securities, impairments on available-for-sale investments, the related income tax implications of these items, tax adjustments in accordance with ASC 740-270 and non-recurring tax events. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.

Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 36.10 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on March 7, 2017 to stockholders of record on February 21, 2017.

"Our December quarter financial results were extremely strong," said Steve Sanghi, Chief Executive Officer. "Our non-GAAP net sales, gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and diluted earnings per share all exceeded the high end of our updated guidance provided on November 29, 2016. We were not able to provide GAAP guidance for the December quarter due to our acquisition of Atmel."

Mr. Sanghi added, “As a result of the "go live" of our business system integration for Atmel on January 1, 2017, several of our customers requested early shipment of their product that was originally requested to be delivered in the early part of January. We believe the impact from these customer requests added approximately one percent to our December quarter revenue. Ordinarily we attempt to schedule these business system integrations in the middle of a quarter to minimize the impact on our quarterly revenue results. As a result, investors should view the true end market demand for our products in the fiscal third quarter to be about one percent lower than our reported GAAP and non-GAAP net sales and our fiscal fourth quarter 2017 true end market demand to be about two percent higher than the midpoint of our GAAP and non-GAAP net sales guidance.”

Mr. Sanghi further added, "Non-GAAP earnings per share was an all-time record and was 14.5 cents per share better than the mid-point of our guidance given on November 29, and up 64.9% from the December quarter of a year ago due to improving sales, gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage and the successful execution of our core business as well as accretion from our acquisitions. GAAP earnings per share was up 62.4% from the December quarter of a year ago."

"Microcontroller revenue was outstanding in the December quarter and represented 63.1% of Microchip’s overall revenue," said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Operating Officer. "We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller portfolio. We continue to gain market share, and we believe we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share, as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry."

Mr. Moorthy added, "Our analog business performance was also outstanding and represented 25.9% of Microchip’s overall revenue in the December quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface, timing and security products to fuel the future growth of our analog business."

Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, "The cash flow from operations in the December quarter was a record $290.8 million. As of December 31, 2016, the consolidated cash and total investment position on our balance sheet was $699.7 million."

Mr. Sanghi added, "I want to thank all of the employees of Microchip, including acquired employees from Micrel, Atmel and other acquisitions worldwide for delivering such a strong quarter."

Mr. Sanghi concluded, "We expect total net sales to be between $872 million and $908 million in the March 2017 quarter. Having achieved non-GAAP operating profit of 32.8% in the December quarter which is very close to our long term target of 33% non-GAAP operating profit, we are revising our long-term operating model. Our long-term non-GAAP operating model used to be 59% gross margin, 26% operating expenses and 33% operating profit. Today we are revising it upwards to 60% non-GAAP gross margin, 24% non-GAAP operating expenses and 36% non-GAAP operating profit. Microchip does not utilize a GAAP long-term operating model.”

Microchip's Highlights for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2016:

•Microchip released a new generation of 8-bit tinyAVR® microcontrollers with Core Independent Peripherals. The family consists of four new devices that range from 14 to 24 pins and 4 KB to 8 KB of Flash.

•Microchip's inventory days at March 31, 2017 are expected to be 98 to 106 days. Our actual inventory level will depend on the inventory that our distributors decide to hold to support their customers, overall demand for our products and our production levels.

•Capital expenditures for the quarter ending March 31, 2017 are expected to be approximately $38 million. Capital expenditures for all of fiscal year 2017 are expected to be approximately $90 million. We are continuing to invest in the equipment needed to support the growth of our production capabilities for fast growing new products and technologies.

1 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Our non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of discontinued operations, share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), preclusion of revenue recognition under GAAP for inventory in the distribution channel on the acquisition dates of our acquisitions, revenue recognition changes related to Atmel and Micrel distributors, resulting from changes to business practices with those distributors, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, gains on equity securities, impairments on available-for-sale investments, the related income tax implications of these items, tax adjustments in accordance with ASC 740-270 and non-recurring tax events. Our non-GAAP results for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 reflect an adjustment for a manufacturing excursion issue with one of our suppliers. Our non-GAAP net sales outlook for the March 2017 quarter reflects accounting for revenue for Atmel distributors on a sell-through basis. Net sales from Atmel's sell-through distributors that the distributors owned as of the acquisition date is not recognized for GAAP purposes. We believe that our disclosure of non-GAAP net sales provides investors with useful information regarding the actual end market demand for our products.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. Our other non-GAAP adjustments are either non-cash expenses or other expenses related to transactions. Management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

We are using non-GAAP net sales, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net income from continuing operations, and non-

GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations which exclude the items noted above, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.

Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of our business. Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

2 Generally, gross margin fluctuates over time, driven primarily by the mix of microcontrollers, mixed-signal products, analog products and memory products sold and licensing revenue; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; costs of wafers from foundries; inventory reserves; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to net sales and profit levels.

3 Diluted Common Shares Outstanding can vary for, among other things, the trading price of our common stock, the exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the potential for incremental dilutive shares from our convertible debentures (additional information regarding our share count is available in the investor relations section of our website under the heading "Supplemental Financial Information"), and repurchases or issuances of shares of our common stock. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table above assumes an average Microchip stock price in the March 2017 quarter between $69 and $71 per share (however, we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period and we cannot estimate what our stock option exercise activity will be during the quarter).
