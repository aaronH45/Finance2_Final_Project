Forward Looking Statements  

Statements contained in this slide presentation regarding PG&E Corporation’s planned investments through 2019 to modernize infrastructure, planned grid modernization investments through 2020, projected rate base and dividend growth through 2019, and other statements that are not purely historical constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management’s current expectations and are based on management’s judgement and opinions. These statements are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties, the realization or resolution of which may be outside management’s control. Actual results may differ materially. PG&E Corporation and the Utility are not able to predict all the factors that may affect future results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to:  

the timing and outcomes of the 2017 GRC, the TO rate case, the cost of capital proceeding, and other ratemaking and regulatory proceedings;  

the amount and timing of costs related to Butte fire litigation, the extent to which such costs can be recovered through insurance, and whether additional investigations and proceedings in connection with Butte fire will be opened;  

the timing and outcomes of (i) the CPUC’s investigation of communications between the Utility and the CPUC that may have violated the CPUC’s rules regarding ex parte communications or are otherwise alleged to be improper, or a potential settlement in connection with this proceeding, and (ii) the U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Francisco and the California Attorney General’s office investigations in connection with communications between the Utility’s personnel and CPUC officials; the terms of probation and the monitorship imposed in the sentencing phase of the Utility’s federal criminal trial, the timing and outcomes of the debarment proceeding, the SED’s unresolved enforcement matters relating to the Utility’s compliance with natural gas-related laws and regulations, and other investigations that have been or may be commenced relating to the Utility’s compliance with natural gas-related laws and regulations, and the ultimate amount of fines, penalties, and remedial and other costs and remedial measures that the Utility may incur as a result;  

the outcomes of the SED’s investigations of potential violations identified through audits, investigations, or self-reports;  

the Utility’s ability to control its costs within the authorized levels of spending and the extent to which the Utility incurs unrecoverable costs that are higher than the forecasts of such costs; changes in cost forecasts or the scope and timing of planned work resulting from changes in customer demand for electricity and natural gas or other reasons;  

the impact that reductions in customer demand for electricity and natural gas have on the Utility’s ability to make and recover its investments through rates and earn its authorized return on equity, and whether the Utility is successful in addressing the impact of growing distributed and renewable generation resources, changing customer demand for natural gas and electric services, and an increasing number of customers departing for community choice aggregators; whether the Utility can continue to obtain insurance and whether insurance coverage is adequate for future losses or claims, especially following a major event that causes widespread third-party losses; the ability of PG&E Corporation and the Utility to access capital markets and other sources of debt and equity financing in a timely manner on acceptable terms, and the amount and timing of additional common stock and debt issuances by PG&E Corporation;  

changes in estimated environmental remediation costs, including costs associated with the Utility’s natural gas compressor sites;  

the outcome of federal or state tax audits and the impact of any changes in federal or state tax laws, policies, regulations, or their interpretation, including as a result of the recent changes in the federal government; the impact of changes in GAAP, standards, rules, or policies, including those related to regulatory accounting, and the impact of changes in their interpretation or application; and  

the other factors disclosed in PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s joint Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.
