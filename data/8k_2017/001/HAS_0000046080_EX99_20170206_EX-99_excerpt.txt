International Segment operating profit increased 15% to $294.5 million, or 13.4% of revenues, compared to $255.4 million, or 13.0% of net revenues.  

Entertainment and Licensing segment net revenues increased 8% to $265.2 million compared to $244.7 million in 2015. Full-year gains were driven by growth in Consumer Products and Digital Gaming, as well as the addition of Boulder Media. As reported operating profit was $49.9 million compared to $76.9 million in 2015. Adjusted operating profit was $82.7 million, which excludes a pre-tax $32.9 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, non-cash fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge related to Backflip Studios. 

Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Product Category Performance  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Boys category revenues for the full-year 2016 increased 4% to $1.85 billion. Revenue growth for the year was driven by gains in Franchise Brand NERF, as well as shipments of YO-KAI WATCH.  

Games category revenues for the year increased 9% to $1.39 billion. Hasbro’s differentiated gaming portfolio drove growth across gaming formats, including face-to-face gaming, off-the-board gaming and digital gaming. Franchise Brand MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenues increased for the eighth straight year, along with growth in PIE FACE, DUEL MASTERS, SIMON, BOP-IT and the successful launch of the SPEAK-OUT game.  

Girls category revenues in 2016 grew 50% to a record $1.19 billion. The category benefited from shipments of Hasbro’s line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN fashion and small dolls, the successful launch of DREAMWORKS’ TROLLS and significant growth from BABY ALIVE. Additional revenue growth came from Hasbro brands including FURREAL FRIENDS and EASY-BAKE OVEN products.  

Preschool category revenues declined 1% to $589.2 million in 2016. The fifth consecutive year of revenue growth in Franchise Brand PLAY-DOH was more than offset by declines in PLAYSKOOL HEROES and core PLAYSKOOL items.  

Beginning with the first quarter 2017 earnings, Hasbro will report its revenue by brand portfolio: Franchise Brands, Partner Brands, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands. At that time, the Company will cease providing a revenue breakdown by product category: Boys, Games, Girls and Preschool. Fourth quarter and full-year 2016 and 2015 brand portfolio revenue is available in the following table.

Certain statements in this release contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include expectations concerning the Company’s potential performance in the future, including with respect to anticipated future benefits from investments in the Company’s business and strategic efforts to grow the Company’s brand portfolio and content delivery over the longer-term, and the Company’s ability to achieve its other financial and business goals and may be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases. The Company's actual actions or results may differ materially from those expected or anticipated in the forward-looking statements due to both known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Specific factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the Company's ability to design, develop, produce, manufacture, source and ship products on a timely and cost-effective basis, as well as interest in and purchase of those products by retail customers and consumers in quantities and at prices that will be sufficient to profitably recover the Company’s costs; (ii) downturns in economic conditions affecting the Company’s markets which can negatively impact the Company’s retail customers and consumers, and which can result in lower employment levels, lower consumer disposable income and spending, including lower spending on purchases of the Company’s products; (iii) other factors which can lower discretionary consumer spending, such as higher costs for fuel and food, drops in the value of homes or other consumer assets, and high levels of consumer debt; (iv) potential difficulties or delays the Company may experience in implementing cost savings and efficiency enhancing initiatives; (v) other economic and public health conditions or regulatory changes in the markets in which the Company and its customers and suppliers operate which could create delays or increase the Company’s costs, such as higher commodity prices, labor costs or transportation costs, or outbreaks of disease; (vi) currency fluctuations, including movements in foreign exchange rates, which can lower the Company’s net revenues and earnings, and significantly impact the Company’s costs; (vii) the concentration of the Company's customers, potentially increasing the negative impact to the Company of difficulties experienced by any of the Company’s customers or changes in their purchasing or selling patterns; (viii) consumer interest in and acceptance of the Discovery Family Channel, and content created by Hasbro Studios and Allspark Pictures; (ix) the inventory policies of the Company’s retail customers, including retailers’ potential decisions to lower their inventories, even if it results in lost sales, as well as the concentration of the Company's revenues in the second half of the year, which coupled with reliance by retailers on quick response inventory management techniques increases the risk of underproduction of popular items, overproduction of less popular items and failure to achieve compressed shipping schedules; (x) delays, increased costs or difficulties associated with any of our or our partners’ planned digital applications or media and entertainment initiatives; (xi) work disruptions, which may impact the Company's ability to manufacture or deliver product in a timely and cost-effective manner; (xii) the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Company's significant retailers which could negatively impact the Company's revenues or bad debt exposure; (xiii) the impact of competition on revenues, margins and other aspects of the Company's business, including the ability to offer Company products which consumers choose to buy instead of competitive products, the ability to secure, maintain and renew popular licenses and the ability to attract and retain talented employees; (xiv) concentration of manufacturing for many of the Company’s products in the People’s Republic of China and the associated impact to the Company of social, economic or public health conditions and other factors affecting China, the movement of products into and out of China, the cost of producing products in China and exporting them to other countries; (xv) the risk of product recalls or product liability suits and costs associated with product safety regulations; (xvi) changes in laws or regulations in the United States and/or in other major markets in which the Company operates, including, without limitation, with respect to taxes, tariffs or product safety, which may increase the Company’s product costs and other costs of doing business, and reduce the Company’s earnings, (xvii) failure to realize the planned benefits from any investments or acquisitions made by the Company, (xviii) the impact of other market conditions, third party actions or approvals and competition which could reduce demand for the Company’s  

products or delay or increase the cost of implementation of the Company's programs or alter the Company's actions and reduce actual results; (xix) the impact of litigation or arbitration decisions or settlement actions; and (xx) other risks and uncertainties as may be detailed from time to time in the Company's public announcements and Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings. The Company undertakes no obligation to make any revisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this release or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this release. 

This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. These non-GAAP financial measures include EBITDA. EBITDA represents net earnings attributable to Hasbro, Inc. excluding net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. As required by SEC rules, we have provided reconciliation on the attached schedule of this measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that EBITDA is one of the appropriate measures for evaluating the operating performance of the Company because it reflects the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, strengthen the balance sheet, and make strategic acquisitions.  

The press release also includes certain of the Company’s 2016 and 2015 cost and expenses, income tax expense, net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge and the gain on the sale of the Company’s manufacturing operations in East Longmeadow, MA and Waterford, Ireland. Management believes that the presentation excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge and the gain on the sale of the manufacturing operations provides a useful measure of the underlying operations of the Company. In addition, the press release includes the increases in the Company’s International segment and certain region net revenues excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates. The impact of changes in exchange rates is calculated by translating the 2016 local currency revenues at 2015 actual rates and comparing this amount to the 2016 reported revenues. Management believes that the presentation excluding the impact of exchange rate changes provides information that is helpful to an investor’s understanding of the underlying business performance absent exchange rate fluctuations which are beyond the Company’s control. These measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net earnings or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP as more fully discussed in the Company's financial statements and filings with the SEC. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
