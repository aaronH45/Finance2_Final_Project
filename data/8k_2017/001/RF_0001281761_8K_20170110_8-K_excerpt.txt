Item 5.04 Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans.

Regions Financial Corporation (the “Company”) sent a notice (the “Original Notice”) to participants and beneficiaries in the Regions Financial Corporation 401(k) Plan (the “Plan”) on November 22, 2016, informing them that the recordkeeper of the Plan was being changed, effective January 1, 2017. The notice indicated that there would be a blackout period beginning on December 23, 2016, and expecting to end on January 13, 2017 (the “Blackout Period”). The transition to the new recordkeeper occurred more quickly than expected, and the Blackout Period ended earlier on January 10, 2017. Participants and beneficiaries now have access to their plan accounts and can direct and diversify their investments and request a loan or a distribution to the extent they could before the Blackout Period started. The Company sent an updated notice (the “Updated Notice”) to participants and beneficiaries informing them that the Blackout Period ended on January 10, 2017, earlier than stated in the Original Notice. A copy of the Updated Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

A participant in the Plan, a security holder, or other interested person may obtain, without charge, information regarding the Blackout Period by contacting MassMutual at 800-701-8892 Monday through Friday between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. Central Time and referencing 62273.

In connection with the foregoing, on January 10, 2017, the Company also sent a separate updated notice to its Executive Officers and Directors pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation BTR (Blackout Trading Restriction) informing them of the change in the ending date of the Blackout Period. A copy of that separate updated notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
