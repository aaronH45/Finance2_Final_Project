FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL SUMMARY

Total revenue in the fourth quarter increased 1% to $3.3 billion compared to the prior year quarter driven primarily by 3% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. 

Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter increased 5% to $2.7 billion compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to $158 million of non-cash expenses related to certain pension settlements, $15 million of transaction costs related to the pending sale of certain assets, $6 million of transaction costs related to acquisitions, and an increase in expense to support 3% organic revenue growth, partially offset by a $67 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, a $10 million decrease in the core expense base related to divested businesses, net of acquisitions, and a $7 million decrease in intangible asset amortization.

Depreciation expense increased 2%, or $1 million, in the fourth quarter to $61 million compared to the prior year quarter.

Intangible asset amortization expense decreased 9%, or $7 million, in the fourth quarter to $70 million compared to the prior year quarter, consisting of a $9 million decrease in HR Solutions and a $2 million increase in Risk Solutions.

Foreign currency exchange rates in the fourth quarter had a $0.04 per share, or $13 million pretax, favorable impact (+$13 million in Risk Solutions, -$6 million in HR Solutions, and +$6 million Unallocated) on GAAP net income and a $0.03 per share, or $10 million pretax, favorable impact (+$12 million in Risk Solutions, -$8 million in HR Solutions, and +$6 million Unallocated) on adjusted net income if the Company were to translate prior year quarter results at current quarter foreign exchange rates. 

Effective tax rate used in the U.S. GAAP financial statements for the fourth quarter was 10.9%, compared to the prior year quarter of 15.8%. After adjusting to exclude the applicable tax impact associated with certain non-cash pension expenses, the adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 14.9% compared to 17.9% in the prior year quarter, due primarily to changes in the geographic distribution of income and certain favorable discrete tax adjustments. The prior year quarter adjusted effective tax rate excludes the applicable tax impact associated with expenses related to certain legacy litigation. These adjustments are discussed in the "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income and Diluted Earnings per Share" on page 13 of this press release. 

Average diluted shares outstanding decreased 4% to 268.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to 279.3 million in the prior year quarter. The Company repurchased 1.8 million Class A Ordinary Shares for approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $2.8 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. Subsequent to the close of the fourth quarter, the Board of Directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing remaining authorization under its share repurchase program. As of February 10, 2017, the Company has approximately $7.7 billion of remaining authorization under its share repurchase program.

Cash flow from operations for 2016 increased 16%, or $317 million, compared to the prior year to a record $2.3 billion driven by an increase in underlying net income after adjusting for certain non-cash pension expenses, lower cash pension contributions, and lower cash tax payments.

2

Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, increased 22%, or $385 million, compared to the prior year to a record $2.1 billion for 2016, driven by an increase in cash flow from operations and a $68 million decrease in capital expenditures. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow from operations can be found on the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue and Free Cash Flow” on page 12 of this press release.

FOURTH QUARTER SEGMENT REVIEW1 

Certain noteworthy items impacted operating income and operating margins in the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015. The fourth quarter segment information provided below includes supplemental information related to organic revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin, which is described in detail on the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Organic Revenue and Free Cash Flow” on page 12 and “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Operating Income and Diluted Earnings per Share” on page 13 of this press release.

RISK SOLUTIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Risk Solutions total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 2% compared to the prior year quarter driven by 3% organic growth in commissions and fees, partially offset by a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The Company has identified certain immaterial legacy errors related to the quarterly timing of revenue recognition within the Americas Retail brokerage business in Risk Solutions that affected quarterly revenue amounts previously reported as discussed in the “Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements” on pages 16 and 17 of this press release. The impact of the errors on the Company’s annual revenue and organic growth is immaterial. 

Retail organic revenue for the fourth quarter increased 3% reflecting revenue growth in both the Americas and International businesses. Americas organic revenue increased 3% reflecting strong growth in Affinity and in Latin America as well as continued record new business generation in US Retail. International organic revenue increased 2% driven by growth across every major region, highlighted by double-digit growth in Health and Benefits brokerage across Asia and EMEA, and overall strength across the Pacific driven by strong new business generation. 

Reinsurance organic revenue for the fourth quarter increased 2% compared to the prior year quarter driven by new business generation in treaty and growth in facultative placements, partially offset by a decline in capital markets transactions and advisory business, as well as a modest unfavorable market impact globally.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compensation and benefits for the fourth quarter increased 5%, or $60 million, compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to $83 million of non-cash expenses related to certain pension settlements and a $20 million increase in the core expense base related to acquired businesses, net of divestitures, partially offset by a $26 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, and expense discipline.

Other general expenses for the fourth quarter increased 5%, or $18 million, compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to an increase in expense to support 3% organic revenue growth, a $12 million increase in the core expense base related to acquired businesses, net of divestitures, $6 million of transaction costs related to acquisitions, and a $2 million increase in intangible asset amortization, partially offset by a $15 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation.

Fourth quarter operating income decreased 7% to $455 million compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusting for certain items detailed on page 13 of this press release, operating income increased 9%, or $49 million, and operating margin increased 190 basis points to 27.6%, each compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by organic revenue growth of 3%, return on investments in data and analytics across the portfolio, and a 100 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by $6 million, or -30 basis points, of transaction costs related to acquisitions.

 HR SOLUTIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

4

HR Solutions total revenue for the fourth quarter decreased 1% to $1.3 billion compared to the prior year quarter driven by a 4% decrease in commissions and fees related to net divestitures and a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by 5% organic growth in commissions and fees.

Organic revenue in Consulting Services was flat as continued growth in retirement solutions, particularly for investment consulting was offset by a decline in project-related work from the prior year quarter and a modest decline in talent and compensation consulting. Organic revenue in Outsourcing increased 8% compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to strong double-digit growth in health care exchanges and continued strength in HR BPO for cloud-based solutions, partially offset by an anticipated modest decline in benefits administration.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compensation and benefits for the fourth quarter decreased $4 million compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to a $34 million decrease in the core expense base related to divested businesses, net of acquisitions, and a $12 million favorable impact from currency translation, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with 5% organic revenue growth and $25 million of non-cash expenses related to certain pension settlements.

Other general expenses for the fourth quarter increased $1 million compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to an increase in expense to support 5% organic growth and $15 million of transaction costs related to the pending sale of certain assets, partially offset by a $9 million decrease in intangible asset amortization, an $8 million decrease in the core expense base related to divested businesses, net of acquisitions, a $7 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, and expense discipline.

Fourth quarter operating income decreased 2% to $281 million compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusting for certain items detailed on page 13 of this press release, operating income increased 7%, or $25 million, and operating margin increased 210 basis points to 28.3%, each compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by solid organic revenue growth of 5% and expense discipline, partially offset by an $8 million, or -10 basis point, unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.

INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES1 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Unallocated expense for the fourth quarter increased $46 million to $107 million compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to $50 million of non-cash expenses related to certain pension settlements. Interest income decreased $1 million to $3 million compared to the prior year quarter. Interest expense increased $2 million to $70 million compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to an increase in total debt outstanding. Other income of $9 million primarily includes net gains due to the favorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies. The prior year quarter primarily includes net gains on the sale of a certain business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies.

2016 FULL YEAR SUMMARY  

Total revenue for 2016 was $11.6 billion due to a 2% decrease in commissions and fees related to divestitures, net of acquisitions, and a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, each compared to the prior year, partially offset by 3% organic growth in commissions and fees. Risk Solutions total revenue increased 1% to $7.5 billion and HR Solutions total revenue decreased 3% to $4.2 billion.

Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures

This communication includes supplemental information related to organic revenue, free cash flow, adjusted operating margin, adjusted earnings per share, and adjusted effective tax rate that exclude the effects of intangible asset amortization, capital expenditures, transaction costs and certain other noteworthy items that affected results for the comparable periods. Organic revenue excludes from reported revenues the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, reimbursable expenses and unusual items. The impact of foreign exchange is determined by translating last year's revenue, expense or net income at this year's foreign exchange rates. Reconciliations are provided in the attached schedules. Supplemental organic revenue information and additional measures that exclude the effects of the restructuring charges and certain other items do not affect net income or any other GAAP reported amounts. Free cash flow is cash flow from operating activity less capital expenditures. The effective tax rate, as adjusted, excludes the applicable tax impact associated with expenses for legacy litigation. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. They should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information regarding their performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.

Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements (in millions, except per share data)

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company identified legacy immaterial errors related to the quarterly timing of revenue recognition for certain brokerage fee agreements in our Americas Retail Brokerage business in Risk Solutions, primarily impacting US Retail. Historically, revenue for these arrangements was typically recognized upon signing an agreement with a customer; however, in some cases, a portion of the arrangement’s revenue should have been recognized in subsequent quarters upon the placement of effective policies. This historical practice resulted in over-recognizing revenue in the fourth quarter and under-recognizing revenue in the first, second, and third quarters of each year. The revised quarterly revenue disclosures included in the schedules of this press release align with the appropriate practice and will be used going forward as reported amounts for the corresponding period. 

The impact to the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position was a decrease of $170 million to Net receivables, an increase of $66 million to Non-current deferred tax assets, and a decrease of $104 million to Retained earnings in all periods presented. The impact to full year Organic Revenue, Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows was immaterial and therefore remain unchanged.
