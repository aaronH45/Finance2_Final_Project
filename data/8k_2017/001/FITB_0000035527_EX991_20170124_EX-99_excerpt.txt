Net Interest Income  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Non-GAAP measure; see discussion of non-GAAP and Reg. G reconciliation beginning on page 32.  

Excluding the $16 million reduction for the card refunds, net interest income (FTE)* of $925 million was up 1 percent from the third quarter of 2016. Reported net interest income of $903 million and net interest income (FTE)* of $909 million both decreased $4 million from the third quarter of 2016, primarily driven by the aforementioned card refunds, partially offset by improved short-term market rates in the fourth quarter and higher investment securities balances.  

The adjusted net interest margin* was 2.91 percent, up 3 bps from the prior quarter, excluding the aforementioned card refunds. The reported net interest margin was 2.84 percent and the net interest margin (FTE)* was 2.86 percent, both decreasing 2 bps from the previous quarter, primarily due to a 5 basis point impact from the aforementioned card refunds. This impact was partially offset by improved short-term market rates in the fourth quarter.  

Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, adjusted net interest income (FTE)* was up 2 percent, excluding the card refunds. Adjusted net interest margin (FTE)* was up 6 bps from the fourth quarter of 2015, excluding the card refunds. Reported net interest income and net interest income (FTE)*, increased by $4 million and $5 million, or 2 percent, respectively from the fourth quarter of 2015. The reported net interest margin and net interest margin (FTE)* increased by 1 bp year-over-year. The increase in net interest income was driven by the impact of higher investment securities balances and improved short-term market rates, partially offset by the previously-mentioned card refunds. The increase in the net interest margin was driven by improved short-term market rates, partially offset by the previously-mentioned card refunds.  

Securities  

Average securities and other short-term investments were $32.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $31.7 billion in the previous quarter and $31.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015. Average balances of other short-term investments decreased by $18 million sequentially to $1.8 billion.

Loans  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average portfolio loan and lease balances decreased $547 million, or 1 percent, sequentially and decreased $630 million, or 1 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2015. The sequential and year-over-year decrease was driven by both declines in automobile loans related to the strategic decision to reduce auto loan originations to improve return on shareholders’ equity and deliberate exits from certain commercial and industrial (C&I) loans that did not meet risk-adjusted profitability targets. The sequential and year-over-year decreases were partially offset by increases in residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans. Period end portfolio loans and leases of $92.1 billion decreased $1.1 billion, or 1 percent, sequentially and $484 million, or 1 percent, from a year ago. The sequential decrease was primarily due to decreases in C&I and automobile loans, partially offset by an increase in residential mortgage loans. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by decreases in automobile and home equity loans, partially offset by increases in residential mortgage and commercial construction loans.  

Average commercial portfolio loan and lease balances decreased $498 million, or 1 percent, sequentially and were flat from the fourth quarter of 2015. Average C&I loans decreased $568 million, or 1 percent, from the prior quarter and decreased $606 million, or 1 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2015. Average commercial real estate loans increased $111 million, or 1 percent, from the prior quarter and increased $674 million, or 7 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2015. Within commercial real estate, growth was relatively balanced as average commercial mortgage balances increased $69 million and average commercial construction balances increased $42 million sequentially. Period end commercial line utilization of 34% decreased 95 bps from the third quarter of 2016 and decreased 88 bps from the fourth quarter of 2015.  

6  

Average consumer portfolio loan and lease balances were flat sequentially and decreased $780 million, or 2 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2015. This was primarily driven by average automobile loans which decreased 3 percent sequentially and 13 percent from a year ago. Average residential mortgage loans increased 3 percent sequentially and 10 percent from the previous year. Average home equity loans decreased 2 percent sequentially and 7 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015. Average credit card loans increased 1 percent sequentially and decreased 2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015.  

Deposits  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Includes commercial customer Eurodollar sweep balances for which the Bancorp pays rates comparable to other commercial deposit accounts.  

Average core deposits increased $2.1 billion, or 2 percent, sequentially and increased $1.2 billion, or 1 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2015. Average transaction deposits increased $2.2 billion, or 2 percent from the third quarter of 2016 and increased $1.3 billion, or 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015. Sequential performance was primarily driven by increased commercial interest checking account balances, as well as consumer money market account balances that benefited from the recent enactment of new money market reforms, partially offset by lower savings account balances. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher consumer money market and consumer interest checking account balances, partially offset by lower savings and foreign office account balances. Other time deposits decreased by 2 percent sequentially and 3 percent year-over-year.  

Average total commercial transaction deposits of $45 billion increased 3 percent sequentially and decreased 2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015. Average total consumer transaction deposits of $52 billion increased 2 percent sequentially and increased 5 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015.

Wholesale Funding  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average wholesale funding of $20.0 billion decreased $2.2 billion, or 10 percent, sequentially and decreased $1.9 billion, or 9 percent, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The sequential decrease in average wholesale funding was primarily driven by a decline in long-term debt largely due to maturities early in the fourth quarter. The year-over-year decline reflected a decrease in federal funds purchased resulting from an increase in deposit balances.  

Noninterest Income  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Noninterest income of $620 million decreased $220 million sequentially and decreased $484 million compared with prior year results. The sequential and year-over-year comparisons reflect the impacts described below.  

8  

Noninterest Income excluding certain items  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Non-GAAP measure; see discussion of non-GAAP on page 32  

Excluding the items in the table above, noninterest income of $608 million increased $12 million, or 2 percent, from the previous quarter and decreased $15 million, or 2 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2015. The sequential increase was primarily due to the $33 million annual payment received from Vantiv pursuant to the tax receivable agreement in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by a decrease in corporate banking revenue. The year-over-year decrease was driven by a decline in mortgage banking net revenue.  

Service charges on deposits of $141 million decreased 1 percent from the third quarter of 2016, and decreased 2 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The sequential decrease primarily reflected a 2 percent decrease in commercial service charges, as well as a 1 percent decrease in retail service charges. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily due to a 5 percent decrease in retail service charges.  

Corporate banking revenue of $101 million decreased 9 percent compared to the third quarter of 2016 and decreased 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015. The sequential comparison reflects decreases in institutional sales revenue and lease remarketing fees, partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange fees. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by lower lease remarketing fees and letter of credit fees, partially offset by higher foreign exchange fees and institutional sales revenue.  

9  

Mortgage banking net revenue was $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, down $1 million from the third quarter of 2016 and down $9 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. Originations of $2.7 billion in the current quarter decreased 5 percent sequentially and increased 54 percent from the same quarter last year. Fourth quarter 2016 originations resulted in $30 million of origination fees and gains on loan sales, compared with $61 million during the previous quarter and $37 million during the fourth quarter of 2015. Net mortgage servicing revenue (which consists of gross mortgage servicing fees, MSR amortization, and net valuation adjustments on MSRs and mark-to-market adjustments on free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio) was $35 million this quarter, $5 million in the third quarter of 2016, and $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross mortgage servicing fees were $48 million this quarter, $49 million in the third quarter of 2016, and $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. MSR amortization was $35 million this quarter, $35 million in the third quarter of 2016, and $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Net servicing asset valuation adjustments resulted in a positive $23 million impact in the fourth quarter of 2016, negative $9 million in the third quarter of 2016, and positive $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.  

Wealth and asset management revenue of $100 million decreased 1 percent from the third quarter of 2016 and decreased 2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by lower personal asset management fees. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower securities and brokerage fees, partially offset by an increase in institutional trust fees.  

Card and processing revenue of $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 was flat sequentially and increased 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015. The year-over-year increase reflected higher spend volume and actively used cards.  

Other noninterest income totaled $137 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with $336 million in the previous quarter and $602 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. As previously described, the results included the adjustments in the table on page 9 with the exception of securities gains / (losses) in all comparable periods. Excluding these items, other noninterest income of $122 million increased approximately $26 million, or 27 percent, from the third quarter of 2016 and was flat from the fourth quarter of 2015. The sequential increase was primarily due to the $33 million annual payment received from Vantiv pursuant to the tax receivable agreement in the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Net losses on investment securities were $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with $4 million net gains in the previous quarter and a $1 million net gain in the fourth quarter of 2015.  

Noninterest Expense  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

10  

Noninterest expense of $960 million declined $13 million, or 1 percent, compared with the third quarter of 2016 and was flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The sequential decrease primarily reflected lower technology and communications expense, the change in provision for unfunded commitments, and seasonally lower marketing expense. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by lower card and processing expense, predominantly due to contract renegotiations as well as lower net occupancy expense, partially offset by increased compensation expense mainly as a result of personnel additions in risk and compliance and information technology.  

Credit Quality  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net charge-offs were $73 million, or 31 bps of average portfolio loans and leases on an annualized basis, in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with net charge-offs of $107 million, or 45 bps, in the third quarter of 2016 and $80 million, or 34 bps, in the fourth quarter of 2015.  

Commercial net charge-offs were $28 million, or 20 bps, and were down $35 million sequentially. The decrease was primarily due to lower charge-offs of C&I loans, which decreased by $36 million from the third quarter of 2016. Commercial real estate net charge-offs were flat from the previous quarter.  

Consumer net charge-offs were $45 million, or 49 bps, and were up $1 million sequentially. Compared with the previous quarter, net charge-offs on residential mortgage loans were flat. Net charge-offs on the auto portfolio were up $2 million. Net charge-offs on home equity and credit card loans were each down $1 million from the third quarter of 2016. Net charge-offs on other consumer loans of $7 million were up $1 million sequentially.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Non-GAAP measure; see discussion of non-GAAP and Reg G. reconciliation beginning on page 32.  

 (b) Under the banking agencies Basel III Final Rule, assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures are calculated based upon the standardized approach for risk-weighted assets. The resulting values are added together resulting in the Bancorp’s total risk-weighted assets.  

 (c) Current period regulatory capital and liquidity ratios are estimated.  

 (d) The Bancorp became subject to the Modified LCR regulations effective January 1, 2016.  

Capital ratios remained strong and grew during the quarter. The CET1 ratio was 10.40 percent, the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio* was 8.87 percent (excluding unrealized gains/losses), and 8.91 percent (including unrealized gains/losses). The Tier I risk-based capital ratio was 11.51 percent, the Total risk-based capital ratio was 15.00 percent, and the Tier I leverage ratio was 9.90 percent.  

Book value per share at December 31, 2016 was $19.82 and tangible book value per share* was $16.60, compared with the September 30, 2016 book value per share of $20.44 and tangible book value per share* of $17.22.

Tax Rate  

The effective tax rate was 22.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with 25.6 percent in the third quarter of 2016 and 30.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. The tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 was impacted by a $6 million tax benefit associated with the early adoption of ASU 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting”, using the modified retrospective transition method. Additionally, the early adoption resulted in incremental tax expense of $1 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $5 million in the second quarter of 2016. The tax rate in the third quarter of 2016 was impacted by Vantiv-related gains, which were partially offset by an $8 million tax benefit in connection with certain commercial lease terminations.  

Other  

On November 21, 2016, Vantiv, Inc. conducted a secondary offering of 4.8 million shares of its Class A common stock on behalf of Fifth Third. Vantiv also concurrently repurchased 850,000 shares of Vantiv Class A common stock from Fifth Third. The 5.65 million shares sold by Fifth Third through these transactions were obtained through the net exercise of the entire remaining warrant position in Vantiv Holding, LLC and the exchange of those Vantiv Holding, LLC units for Class A shares of common stock in Vantiv, Inc. The warrant position gave Fifth Third the right to purchase approximately 7.8 million Class C units at a $15.98 strike price, which was settled through the net issuance of 5.65 million units. For more detail, see the 8-K dated November 22, 2016.  

Fifth Third Bank owns approximately 35 million units representing a 17.9 percent interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC, convertible into shares of Vantiv, Inc., a publicly traded firm. Based upon Vantiv’s closing price of $59.62 on December 31, 2016, our interest in Vantiv was valued at approximately $2.1 billion. Next month in our 10-K, we will update our disclosure of the carrying value of our interest in Vantiv stock, which was $404 million as of September 30, 2016. The difference between the market value and the book value of Fifth Third’s interest in Vantiv’s shares is not recognized in Fifth Third’s equity or capital.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In addition to GAAP measures, management considers various Non-GAAP measures when evaluating the performance of the business, including : “net interest income on an FTE basis,” “net interest margin on an FTE basis,” “adjusted net interest margin,” “efficiency ratio,” “income before income taxes on an FTE basis,” “pre-provision net revenue,” “noninterest income excluding certain items,” “adjusted noninterest income,” “adjusted noninterest income excluding mortgage banking revenue,” “tangible net income available to common shareholders,” “average tangible common equity,” “tangible common equity,” “tangible equity,” “tangible book value per common share,” and “Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III Final Rule (fully phased-in),” and certain ratios derived from these measures.  

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.  

Pre-provision net revenue is defined as net interest income plus noninterest income minus noninterest expense. Management believes this measure is important because it provides a ready view of pre-tax earnings before the impact of provision expense. Noninterest income excluding certain items is provided by management to assist the reader in identifying significant, unusual, or large transactions that impacted noninterest income.  

Management considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity and tangible common equity (including and excluding unrealized gains/losses), in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be Non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that providing the tangible common equity ratio excluding unrealized gains/losses on certain assets and liabilities enables investors and others to assess the Bancorp’s use of equity without the effects of gains or losses some of which are uncertain and providing the tangible common equity ratio including unrealized gains/losses enables investors and others to assess the Bancorp’s use of equity if all unrealized gains or losses were to be monetized.  

Management believes tangible book value per share and return on average tangible common equity are important measures for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders and book value of common stock without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. This is useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally, compared to other companies in the industry who present similar measures.  

The Bancorp became subject to the Basel III Final Rule on January 1, 2015 which defined various regulatory capital ratios including the Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) ratio. The CET1 capital ratio has transition provisions that will be phased out over time. CET1 capital ratio is presented on a fully phased-in basis for comparative purposes with other organizations. The Bancorp considers the fully phased-in CET1 ratio a Non-GAAP measure since it is not the CET1 ratio in effect for the periods presented. Since analysts and the U.S. banking agencies may assess the Bancorp’s capital adequacy using these ratios, management believes they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis.  

Please note that although Non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight, they should not be considered in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for analysis using GAAP measures.  

Please see page 33 for Reg. G reconciliations of all historical Non-GAAP measures used in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management has provided forward-looking guidance on certain Non-GAAP measures in connection with its earnings presentation in order to facilitate comparability with the Bancorp’s historical performance and financial condition as reflected in these Non-GAAP measures. Such forward-looking Non-GAAP measures include return on tangible common equity; net interest margin (FTE); adjusted net interest margin; net interest income (FTE); adjusted noninterest income; adjusted noninterest income excluding mortgage banking net revenue; and noninterest income, excluding certain transactions and adjustments related to the Bancorp’s investment in Vantiv, Visa total return swap, and branch sales, closures and consolidations. Bancorp’s management does not estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of items similar to those that it has excluded to generate these Non-GAAP measures on a historical basis because the occurrence and amounts of items such as these are difficult to predict. As a result, the Bancorp has not provided reconciliations of its forward-looking Non-GAAP measures.
