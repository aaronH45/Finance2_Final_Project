Exhibit 99.1  

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.  

NEWS RELEASE  

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   February 25, 2017  

Omaha, NE (BRK.A; BRK.B) –  

We show below summary financial data for the fourth quarter and full year. However, we urge investors and reporters to carefully read our Annual Report, which has been posted on the Internet at www.berkshirehathaway.com. The limited information that follows in this press release is totally inadequate for making an informed investment judgment or for an evaluation of 2016 business performance. Earnings are stated on an after-tax basis. (Dollar amounts are in millions, except for per share amounts).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Note: Per share amounts for the Class B shares are 1/1,500th those shown for the Class A.  

An analysis of Berkshire’s operating earnings follows (dollar amounts are in millions).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the table on the prior page (which, as noted, reports after-tax results), we give investment and derivative gains (losses) lines of their own because the amounts of these in any given quarter or year are often meaningless.  

At December 31, 2016, our book value had increased by 10.7% since yearend 2015 to $172,108 per Class A equivalent share. Insurance float (the net liabilities we assume under insurance contracts) at December 31, 2016 was approximately $91.6 billion.  

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures in accordance with Regulation G are included herein.  

Berkshire presents its results in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful, as well as most transparent, to the investing public and others who use Berkshire’s financial information. That presentation includes the use of certain non-GAAP financial measures. In addition to the GAAP presentations of net earnings, Berkshire shows operating earnings defined as net earnings exclusive of investment and derivative gains/losses.  

Although the investment of insurance and reinsurance premiums to generate investment income and investment gains or losses is an integral part of Berkshire’s operations, investing activities are independent of the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other-than-temporary declines in value without actual realization or when certain types of investments are marked-to-market through earnings. In sum, investment and derivative gains/losses for any particular period are not indicative of quarterly business performance.
