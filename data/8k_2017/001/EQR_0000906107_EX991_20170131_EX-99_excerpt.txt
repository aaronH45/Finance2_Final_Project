Equity Residential Reports Full Year 2016 Results

Provides Outlook for 2017

Chicago, IL - January 31, 2017 - Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. All per share results are reported as available to common shares/units on a diluted basis.

“Equity Residential continued its long and successful track record of investor centric capital allocation activity in 2016 with the sale of nearly 30,000 apartment units and the return of $4 billion to our shareholders in special dividends,” said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential’s President and CEO. “These highly strategic sales capitalized on extraordinary investor demand for multifamily assets which enabled Equity Residential to maximize value for its shareholders while completing the transformation of its portfolio into one focused primarily on urban and highly walkable, close-in suburban assets.”

“From an operating perspective, same store revenue growth which began to slow in 2016 will continue to weaken in 2017 due to new apartment supply and slowing growth in higher paying jobs,” said Mr. Neithercut. “However, extraordinarily strong demand for rental housing driven by favorable demographics, household growth, low unemployment and rising incomes continue to support the long term outlook for rental housing in our core markets and the prospects for excellent risk adjusted returns to our shareholders.”

2016 Highlights

•The Company generated same store revenue growth of 3.7% in 2016 as compared to 2015.

•The Company sold 98 consolidated apartment properties, consisting of 29,440 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of approximately $6.8 billion, generating an Unlevered IRR of 11.8%. These sales produced a net gain on sales of real estate properties of approximately $4.0 billion and an Economic Gain of approximately $2.6 billion.

•The Company paid its shareholders special dividends of approximately $4.0 billion, or $11 per share, using proceeds from the above property sales. In addition, the Company paid its shareholders approximately $765.7 million, or $2.015 per share, in regular quarterly dividends. 

•The Company stabilized six development properties during the year: Prism at Park Avenue South and 170 Amsterdam in New York; Junction 47 and Odin in Seattle; Azure in San Francisco; and Vista 99 in San Jose. These assets had a total development cost of approximately $894.2 million and a weighted average projected yield of 6.0%.

•The Company entered into a new $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which matures in January 2022 and has a lower cost than the Company’s prior agreement.

Fourth Quarter 2016

Earnings per Share (EPS) for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $0.75 compared to $0.55 in the fourth quarter of 2015. The difference is due primarily to a higher amount of property sale gains due to more property sales in the fourth quarter of 2016, lower depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a direct result of the Company’s significant sales activity in 2016 and the items described below.

FFO (Funds from Operations), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), was $0.80 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $0.92 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. The difference is due primarily to the various adjustment items listed on page 25 of this release and the items described below.

Normalized FFO for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $0.79 per share compared to $0.93 per share in the 

fourth quarter of 2015. The following items impacted Normalized FFO per share in the quarter:

•A positive impact of approximately $0.02 per share from increased same store net operating income (NOI);

•A positive impact of approximately $0.04 per share from Lease-Up NOI; 

•A positive impact of approximately $0.04 per share from lower total interest expense due to lower debt balances; and

•A negative impact of approximately $0.24 per share of lower NOI primarily as a result of the Company’s 2016 disposition activity.

Reconciliations and definitions of FFO and Normalized FFO are provided on pages 7, 28 and 29 of this release and the Company has included guidance for Normalized FFO on page 26 and FFO and EPS on page 29 of this release.

Year Ended December 31, 2016

EPS for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $11.68 compared to $2.36 for the full year 2015. The difference is due primarily to a higher amount of property sale gains due to significantly more property sales in 2016, partially offset by the items described below. 

FFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2.94 per share compared to $3.48 per share in the same period of 2015. The difference is due primarily to the various adjustment items listed on page 25 of this release and the items described below. 

Normalized FFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3.09 per share compared to $3.46 per share for the full year 2015. The difference is due primarily to:

•A positive impact of approximately $0.15 per share from increased same store NOI;

•A positive impact of approximately $0.13 per share from Lease-Up NOI; 

•A positive impact of approximately $0.21 per share from lower total interest expense due to lower debt balances;

•A negative impact of approximately $0.83 per share of lower NOI primarily as a result of the Company’s 2016 disposition activity; and

2

•A negative impact of approximately $0.03 per share from higher general and administrative expense, lower fee and asset management income and other items.

On a same store fourth quarter to fourth quarter comparison, which includes 70,881 apartment units, revenues increased 2.9%, expenses increased 5.6% and NOI increased 1.9%. Average Rental Rate increased 3.0% and occupancy decreased 0.1%. 

On a same store year to year comparison, which includes 69,879 apartment units, revenues increased 3.7%, expenses increased 3.3% and NOI increased 3.9%. Average Rental Rate increased 3.7% and occupancy decreased 0.1%. 

Investment Activity

The Company sold seven consolidated apartment properties, consisting of 1,609 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of approximately $243.5 million at a weighted average Disposition Yield of 6.6% and generating an Unlevered IRR of 12.5%. 

Also during the quarter, the Company stabilized its Vista 99 development in San Jose, California at a projected yield of 7.1%. 

During 2016, the Company acquired four consolidated apartment properties, consisting of 573 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $249.3 million at a weighted average Acquisition Capitalization Rate of 4.8%. Also during 2016, the Company sold 98 consolidated apartment properties, consisting of 29,440 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of approximately $6.8 billion, generating an Unlevered IRR of 11.8%. These sales produced a net gain on sales of real estate properties of approximately $4.0 billion and an Economic Gain of approximately $2.6 billion. The weighted average Disposition Yield on these sales is estimated at 5.4%. Also during 2016, the Company sold its entire interest in the management contracts and related rights associated with the military housing ventures at Joint Base Lewis McChord in Washington State, for approximately $63.3 million, generating a gain on sale of approximately $52.4 million. Additionally during 2016, the Company sold three land parcels for an aggregate sale price of approximately $57.5 million and an unconsolidated property in Atlanta for which the Company received approximately $12.4 million for its 20% interest. 

Capital Markets Activity

On October 12, 2016, the Company closed a $500 million unsecured note offering maturing November 1, 2026 with a coupon of 2.85% and an all in effective rate of approximately 3.10% including the effect of underwriters’ fees and the termination of certain interest rate hedges. Proceeds from this issuance were used for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

On November 3, 2016, the Company entered into a new $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement. The new facility matures in January 2022 and has an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread (currently 0.825%) with an annual facility fee of 12.5 basis points. Both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the Company’s long-term debt. This facility replaced the Company’s existing $2.5 billion facility which was scheduled to mature in April 2018.

First Quarter 2017 Guidance

The Company has established an EPS guidance range of $0.32 to $0.36 for the first quarter of 2017. The difference between the Company’s fourth quarter 2016 EPS of $0.75 and the midpoint of the first quarter 2017 guidance range of $0.34 is due primarily to lower expected gains on property sales and the items described below.

3

The Company has established an FFO guidance range of $0.68 to $0.72 per share for the first quarter of 2017. The difference between the Company’s fourth quarter 2016 FFO of $0.80 per share and the midpoint of the first quarter 2017 guidance range of $0.70 per share is due primarily to higher expected debt extinguishment costs and the items described below. 

The Company has established a Normalized FFO guidance range of $0.71 to $0.75 per share for

the first quarter of 2017. The difference between the Company’s fourth quarter 2016 Normalized FFO of $0.79 per share and the midpoint of the first quarter 2017 guidance range of $0.73 per share is due primarily to:

•A negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share from lower same store NOI;

•A negative impact of approximately $0.01 per share of lower NOI primarily as a result of the Company’s 2016 disposition activity; and

•A negative impact of approximately $0.03 per share from higher overhead costs (general and administrative and property management costs), which are typically front-end loaded for the year. The Company expects total overhead costs to decrease in 2017 from 2016.

The difference between the Company’s full year 2016 EPS of $11.68 and the midpoint of the full year 2017 guidance range of $1.97 is due primarily to lower expected gains on property sales in 2017 and the items described below.

The Company has established an FFO guidance range of $3.01 to $3.11 per share for full year 2017. The difference between the Company’s full year 2016 FFO of $2.94 per share and the midpoint of the full year 2017 guidance range of $3.06 per share is due primarily to lower gains on non-operating asset sales and lower expected debt extinguishment costs and the items described below.

4

•A positive impact of approximately $0.12 per share from NOI from non-same store properties, inclusive of Lease-Up NOI; 

•A negative impact of approximately $0.12 per share of lower NOI primarily as a result of the Company’s 2016 disposition activity; 

•A negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share from higher total interest expense due to lower capitalized interest as the Company’s development projects are put into service and higher expected floating rates in 2017, partially offset by the significant debt repayment activity during the first quarter of 2016; and

•A negative impact of approximately $0.01 per share from other items including lower fee and asset management income and lower interest and other income partially offset by lower overhead costs (general and administrative and property management costs).

Funds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations: 

Funds From Operations (“FFO”) – The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”)), excluding gains (or losses) from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Expected FFO per share is calculated on a basis consistent with actual FFO per share and is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of expected operating performance when compared to expected EPS.

The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units can help compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.

Normalized Funds From Operations ("Normalized FFO") – Normalized FFO begins with FFO and excludes:

• the impact of any expenses relating to non-operating asset impairment and valuation allowances;

• property acquisition and other transaction costs related to mergers and acquisitions and pursuit cost write-offs;

• gains and losses from early debt extinguishment, including prepayment penalties, preferred share redemptions and the cost related to the implied option value of non-cash convertible debt discounts;

• gains and losses on the sales of non-operating assets, including gains and losses from land parcel sales, net of the effect of income tax benefits or expenses; and

• other miscellaneous items.

Expected Normalized FFO per share is calculated on a basis consistent with actual Normalized FFO per share and is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of expected operating performance when compared to expected EPS. 

The Company believes that Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the Company's operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company's actual operating results. 

FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

FFO available to Common Shares and Units and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with GAAP. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the "Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership". Subject to certain restrictions, the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.

Additional Reconciliations and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms – Continued

(Amounts in thousands except per share and per apartment unit data)

(All per share data is diluted)

Non-Same Store Properties – For annual comparisons, primarily includes all properties acquired during 2015 and 2016, plus any properties in lease-up and not stabilized as of January 1, 2015.

Normalized Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") – Represents net income in accordance with GAAP before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation expense and amortization expense and further adjusted for non-comparable items. Normalized EBITDA, total debt to Normalized EBITDA and net debt to Normalized EBITDA are important metrics in evaluating the credit strength of the Company and its ability to service its debt obligations. The Company believes that Normalized EBITDA, total debt to Normalized EBITDA and net debt to Normalized EBITDA are useful to investors, creditors and rating agencies because they allow investors to compare the Company's credit strength to prior reporting periods and to other companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company's actual credit quality. 

Physical Occupancy – The weighted average occupied apartment units for the reporting period divided by the average of total apartment units available for rent for the reporting period.

Same Store Properties – For annual comparisons, primarily includes all properties acquired or completed that are stabilized prior to January 1, 2015, less properties subsequently sold. Properties are included in Same Store when they are stabilized for all of the current and comparable periods presented. 

% of Stabilized NOI – Represents budgeted 2017 NOI for stabilized properties and projected annual NOI at stabilization (defined as having achieved 90% occupancy for three consecutive months) for properties that are in lease-up. 

Total Capital Cost – Estimated cost for projects under development and/or developed and all capitalized costs incurred to date plus any estimates of costs remaining to be funded for all projects, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, capitalized real estate taxes and insurance, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, all in accordance with GAAP. 

Total Market Capitalization – The aggregate of the market value of the Company’s outstanding common shares, including restricted shares, the market value of the Company’s operating partnership units outstanding, including restricted units (based on the market value of the Company’s common shares) and the outstanding principal balance of debt. The Company believes this is a useful measure of a real estate operating company’s long-term liquidity and balance sheet strength, because it shows an approximate relationship between a company’s total debt and the current total market value of its assets based on the current price at which the Company’s common shares trade. However, because this measure of leverage changes with fluctuations in the Company’s share price, which occur regularly, this measure may change even when the Company’s earnings, interest and debt levels remain stable.

Turnover – Total residential move-outs divided by total residential apartment units, including inter-property and intra-property transfers.

Unencumbered NOI % – Represents NOI generated by consolidated real estate assets unencumbered by outstanding secured debt as a percentage of total NOI generated by all of the Company's consolidated real estate assets.

Unlevered Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) – The Unlevered IRR on sold properties refers to the internal rate of return calculated by the Company based on the timing and amount of (i) total revenue earned during the period owned by the Company and (ii) the gross sales price net of selling costs, offset by (iii) the undepreciated capital cost of the properties at the time of sale and (iv) total direct property operating expenses (including real estate taxes and insurance) incurred during the period owned by the Company. Each of the items (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) is calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

The calculation of the Unlevered IRR does not include an adjustment for the Company’s general and administrative expense, interest expense or property management expense. Therefore, the Unlevered IRR is not a substitute for net income as a measure of our performance. Management believes that the Unlevered IRR achieved during the period a property is owned by the Company is useful because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Company’s acquisition, development, rehab, management and ultimate sale of a property, before the impact of Company overhead. The Unlevered IRR achieved on the properties as cited in this release should not be viewed as an indication of the gross value created with respect to other properties owned by the Company, and the Company does not represent that it will achieve similar Unlevered IRRs upon the disposition of other properties. The weighted average Unlevered IRR for sold properties is weighted based on all cash flows over the investment period for each respective property, including net sales proceeds.
