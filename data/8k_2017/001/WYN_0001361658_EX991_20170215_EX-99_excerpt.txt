Wyndham Worldwide Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Results 

Increases Dividend 16% 

PARSIPPANY, N.J. (February 15, 2017) – Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (NYSE:WYN) today announced results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016. 

FOURTH QUARTER 2016 OPERATING RESULTS 

Fourth quarter revenues were $1.3 billion, up 1% compared with the prior year period. Full reconciliations of GAAP results to non-GAAP measures for all reported periods appear in the tables to this press release. 

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $164 million compared with $140 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 26% to $1.53 per diluted share compared with $1.21 for the prior year period. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2016, which excludes charges and gains in both 2016 and 2015 as detailed in Table 7 of this press release, was $146 million compared with $113 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 38% to $1.35 from $0.98 per diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted net income and EPS benefited from earnings growth across all of our businesses. EPS also benefited from the Company’s share repurchase program. 

Fourth quarter EBITDA was $322 million, compared with $275 million in the prior year period, an increase of 17%. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes charges and gains in 2016 and charges in 2015 as detailed in Table 8 of this press release, was $318 million, compared with $273 million in the prior year period, an increase of 16%. 

“In 2016, we delivered earnings growth and free cash flow that were both in line with our targets despite headwinds from a higher provision for loan losses and foreign exchange rates,” said Stephen P. Holmes, chairman and CEO. “We achieved these results through consistent execution, careful expense management, and continued disciplined capital allocation.” 

FULL YEAR 2016 OPERATING RESULTS 

Revenues for full year 2016 were $5.6 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior year. 

Net income for full year 2016 was $611 million compared with $612 million for full year 2015. Diluted EPS increased 8% to $5.53 from $5.14 per diluted share in the prior year. Adjusted net income for full year 2016, which excludes charges and gains in both 2016 and 2015 as detailed in Table 7 of this press release, was $636 million compared with $608 million for full year 2015. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 13% to $5.75 from $5.11 in the prior year period. Adjusted net income and EPS benefited from earnings growth across all of our businesses. EPS also benefited from the Company’s share repurchase program. 

Full year 2016 EBITDA was $1,331 million, compared with $1,266 million in the prior year, an increase of 5%. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes charges and gains in 2016 and charges in 2015 as detailed in Table 8 of this press release, was $1,373 million. This compares with $1,297 million in the prior year, an increase of 6%. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 7%. 

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $973 million, compared with $991 million in the prior year period. The decrease reflects unfavorable currency movements of $48 million, including a $24 million devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar in the first quarter of 2016. 

Free cash flow was $782 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, compared with $769 million for the same period in 2015, reflecting lower capital expenditures that were partially offset by the unfavorable currency movements referenced above. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. 

FOURTH QUARTER 2016 BUSINESS UNIT RESULTS 

Hotel Group 

Revenues were $316 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with $314 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenues reflected higher franchise fees and growth in the Company’s Wyndham Rewards credit card program, partially offset by lower reimbursable property management revenues. 

EBITDA was $99 million in the fourth quarter compared with $94 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6% to $99 million. In constant currency and excluding acquisitions, adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. This reflects the higher franchise fees and growth in the Company’s Wyndham Rewards credit card program. 

Fourth quarter domestic same store RevPAR increased 2.9%. Excluding oil markets, domestic same store RevPAR increased 3.7%. In constant currency, total systemwide same store RevPAR increased 2.7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, which reflects softness in domestic and Canadian oil markets. 

As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s hotel system consisted of over 8,000 properties and over 697,600 rooms, a 2.9% net room increase compared with year-end 2015. The development pipeline increased to more than 1,110 hotels and approximately 138,300 rooms, of which 60% were international and 67% were new construction. 

Destination Network 

Revenues were $317 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with $310 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 2%. In constant currency and excluding acquisitions, revenues increased 3%. 

Vacation rental revenues were $151 million compared with $144 million in the prior year quarter. In constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions, vacation rental revenues were up 5%, reflecting a 5.3% increase in transaction volume, which benefited from enhanced yield management as well as capacity increases across our Denmark-based Novasol brand and our U.K. cottage and parks brands. Average net price per rental was flat. 

Exchange revenues were $145 million compared with $146 million in the prior year quarter. In constant currency, exchange revenues grew 1% as exchange revenue per member increased 0.4% and the average number of members increased 0.2%. 

EBITDA was $53 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $44 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased $9 million to $52 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, which reflects the revenue gains from continued strong vacation rental performance and lower costs. 

Vacation Ownership  

Revenues were $705 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with $706 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Gross VOI sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 were flat, impacted by sales office closures from a restructuring and Hurricane Matthew. The number of new owners added during the quarter was up 8% from the prior year quarter. Volume per guest was up 0.4% and tour flow declined 1.5%, reflecting the closure of sales sites as noted above. 

EBITDA was $182 million in the fourth quarter compared with $174 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $191 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 10% compared with the prior year quarter, due to lower costs. 

OTHER ITEMS  

 ·The Company’s Board of Directors authorized an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.58 from $0.50 per share, beginning with the dividend that is expected to be declared in the first quarter of 2017. 

 ·The Company repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for $150 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 at an average price of $70.34. From January 1 through February 14, 2017, the Company repurchased an additional 1.0 million shares for $75 million.  

 ·Net interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $32 million, compared with $35 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This reflects a larger proportion of lower cost variable debt partially offset by higher debt levels. 

 ·Depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $65 million, compared with $61 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting new projects that were placed into service.

 ·Cash and cash equivalents of $185 million, compared with $171 million at December 31, 2015

A schedule of debt is included in Table 12 of this press release. 

OUTLOOK  

Note to Editors: The guidance excludes possible future share repurchases, while analysts’ estimates often include share repurchases. This results in discrepancies between Company guidance and database consensus forecasts. 

The Company provides the following guidance for the full year 2017: 

 ·Revenues of approximately $5.80 billion to $5.95 billion 

 ·Adjusted net income of approximately $637 million to $658 million 

 ·Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.41 billion to $1.44 billion 

 ·Adjusted diluted EPS of approximately $5.90 to $6.10 based on a diluted share count of 108 million  

In determining adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, the Company excludes certain items which are otherwise included in determining the comparable GAAP financial measures. A description of the adjustments that have been applicable for the reported periods in determining adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS are reflected in Tables 7 and 8 of this press release. The Company is providing an outlook for net income, EPS and EBITDA only on a non-GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the totality or ultimate outcome or occurrence of these adjustments for the outlook period, which can be dependent on future events that may not be reliably predicted. See Table 10 for certain non-GAAP information concerning the outlook period. 

The Company will post full guidance information on its website following the conference call.

OPERATING RESULTS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 

(In millions) 

In addition to other measures, management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon net revenues and “EBITDA”, which is defined as net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense (excluding consumer financing interest), early extinguishment of debt, interest income (excluding consumer financing revenues) and income taxes, each of which is presented on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company also uses adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure of its operating performance. The Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful measures of assessing performance of the Company and for the Company's segments which, when considered with GAAP measures, give a more complete understanding of its operating performance and assist our investors in evaluating our ongoing operating performance for the current reporting period and, where provided, over different reporting periods, by adjusting for certain items which may be recurring or nonrecurring and which in our view do not necessarily reflect ongoing operating performance. We also internally use these measures to assess our operating performance, both in absolute terms and in comparison to other companies, and in evaluating or making selected compensation decisions. These supplemental disclosures are in addition to GAAP reported measures. The Company’s presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.  

The following tables summarize net revenues and EBITDA for the Company's reportable segments, as well as reconcile EBITDA to net income for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

OPERATING STATISTICS 

GLOSSARY OF TERMS 

Hotel Group 

Number of Rooms: Represents the number of rooms at hotel group properties at the end of the period which are either (i) under franchise and/or management agreements, or company owned and (ii) properties under affiliation agreements for which the Company receives a fee for reservation and/or other services provided.  

Average Occupancy Rate: Represents the percentage of available rooms occupied during the period. 

Average Daily Rate (ADR): Represents the average rate charged for renting a lodging room for one day.  

RevPAR: Represents revenue per available room and is calculated by multiplying average occupancy rate by ADR. Comparable RevPAR represents RevPAR of hotels which are included in both periods. 

Destination Network 

Average Number of Members: Represents members in our vacation exchange programs who paid annual membership dues as of the end of the period or who are within the allowed grace period. For additional fees, such participants are entitled to exchange intervals for intervals at other properties affiliated with the Company's vacation exchange business. In addition, certain participants may exchange intervals for other leisure-related services and products. 

Exchange Revenue Per Member: Represents total annualized revenues generated from fees associated with memberships, exchange transactions, member-related rentals and other servicing for the period divided by the average number of vacation exchange members during the period.  

Vacation Rental Transactions: Represents the number of transactions that are generated in connection with customers booking their vacation rental stays through one of our vacation brands. One rental transaction is recorded for each standard one-week rental. 

Average Net Price Per Vacation Rental: Represents the net rental price generated from renting vacation properties to customers and other related rental servicing fees divided by the number of vacation rental transactions. 

Vacation Ownership 

Gross Vacation Ownership Interest Sales: Represents sales of vacation ownership interest (VOIs), including WAAM sales, before the net effect of percentage-of-completion accounting and loan loss provisions. We believe gross VOI sales provide an enhanced understanding of the performance of our vacation ownership business because it directly measures the sales volume of this business during a given reporting period. See Table 9 for a reconciliation of Gross VOI sales to vacation ownership interest sales.  

Tours: Represents the number of tours taken by guests in our efforts to sell VOIs. 

Volume per Guest (VPG): Represents Gross VOI sales (excluding tele-sales upgrades, which are non-tour upgrade sales) divided by the number of tours. The Company has excluded non-tour upgrade sales in the calculation of VPG because non-tour upgrade sales are generated by a different marketing channel. See Table 9 for a detail of tele-sales upgrades for 2013-2016.  

General 

Constant Currency: Represents a comparison eliminating the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations between periods (foreign currency translation). 

Currency-Neutral: Represents a comparison eliminating the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations between periods (foreign currency translation) and the impact caused by any foreign exchange related activities (i.e., hedges, balance sheet remeasurements and/or adjustments).

(Unaudited) 

Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Free Cash Flow: 

We define free cash flow to be net cash provided by operating activities less property and equipment additions which we also refer to as capital expenditures. 

We believe free cash flow to be a useful operating performance measure to evaluate the ability of our operations to generate cash for uses other than capital expenditures and, after debt service and other obligations, our ability to grow our business through acquisitions, development advances and equity investments, as well as our ability to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measures of net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities as a means for evaluating Wyndham Worldwide is that free cash flow does not represent the total cash movement for the period as detailed in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 

The following table provides more details on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measure and the related reconciliation between these financial measures:

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Note: Full year amounts may not add across due to rounding. 

 (*)Excludes share-based compensation expenses for which there was no impact on adjusted EBITDA. Such costs amounted to $1 million during Q1, Q2, Q3 and $4 million for Q4 2016 and $7 million for the full year. During 2015, such costs amounted to $1 million during Q1, Q2 and Q3 and $3 million for the full year. The Company believes providing adjusted EBITDA with the additional exclusion of share-based compensation expense assists our investors and management by providing an additional financial measure to evaluate ongoing operations by excluding the variations among companies in timing, amount and reporting of share-based compensation expense, which may differ significantly among companies.

GROSS VOI SALES  

We believe gross vacation ownership sales provide an enhanced understanding of the performance of our vacation ownership business because it directly measures the sales volume of this business during a given reporting period. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of Gross VOI sales (see Table 3) to vacation ownership interest sales (see Table 5):

2017 OUTLOOK - NON-GAAP 

(In millions, except per share data) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In determining adjusted EBIDTA, adjusted Net Income and adjusted EPS, the Company excludes certain items which are otherwise included in determining the comparable GAAP financial measures. A description of the adjustments which have been applicable in determining adjusted EBITDA, adjusted Net Income and adjusted EPS is included in Tables 7 and 8. The Company is providing outlook for EBITDA, Net Income and EPS only on a non-GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the totality or ultimate outcome or occurrence of these adjustments for the forward-looking period, which can be dependent on future events that may not be reliably predicted, such as acquisition costs, legacy expenses, restructuring costs, asset impairments, contract termination costs, currency devaluations, and early extinguishment of debt costs. Based on past reported results, where one or more of these items have been applicable, such excluded special items could be material, individually or in the aggregate, to the reported results. See Tables 7 and 8 for historical adjustments. 

 (a)Outlook represents Company's approximate projection of performance for the outlook period. Projections may not total because the Company does not expect the actual results of all items to be at the precise amount simultaneously.  

 (b)We estimate for the 2017 full year outlook period pre-tax adjustments related to restructuring expenses totaling between $8 million and $12 million (after-tax between $5 million and $8 million). These estimates do not include special items for the outlook period that cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty. We cannot assure that the foregoing estimates for the outlook period will be accurate or may not significantly change or that other special items may not occur in the outlook period.

NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION - CONSTANT CURRENCY AND CURRENCY NEUTRAL 

(In millions, except per share data) 

The Company reports certain current year period financial measures on a constant currency and currency-neutral basis and excluding the impact of acquisitions. The Company believes providing certain financial measures on a constant currency and currency-neutral basis as well as excluding the impact of acquisitions assists management and investors in better understanding underlying results and trends by excluding the impact of period over period changes in foreign exchange rates and changes resulting from acquisitions. 

Constant currency results assume foreign results are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates consistent with those in the comparable period. 

Currency Neutral results (i) assume foreign results are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates consistent with those in the comparable period and (ii) eliminating foreign exchange related activities such as foreign exchange hedges, balance sheet remeasurements, currency devaluations and/or other adjustments. 

Acquisition results are defined as the incremental period over period changes in the Company's results directly attributable to acquisitions.

The receivables held by the bankruptcy-remote SPEs are not available to the Company's creditors and legally are not the Company's assets. Additionally, the non-recourse debt that is securitized through the SPEs is legally not a liability of the Company and thus, the creditors of these SPEs have no recourse to the Company for principal and interest.
