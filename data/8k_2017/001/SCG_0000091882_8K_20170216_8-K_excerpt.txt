Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On February 16, 2017, SCANA Corporation (the Company) issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The press release discloses the following non-GAAP measures: (1) guidance for 2017 GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings per share, (2) average annual growth rate target for GAAP-adjusted weather normalized earnings per share and (3) 2016 GAAP-adjusted weather normalized earnings per share. Each of these non-GAAP measures excludes the effects of abnormal weather in the electric business.

The Company's management believes that these non-GAAP earnings and earnings growth measures provide a meaningful representation of the Company's fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period-over-period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data. In management's opinion, these non-GAAP measures serve as useful indicators of the financial results of the Company's primary businesses and as a basis for management's provision of earnings guidance and growth projections. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures in part in making budgetary and operational decisions including determining eligibility for certain incentive compensation payments. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the GAAP measures of earnings per share or average annual earnings per share growth rate, but are offered as supplements to those GAAP measures.
