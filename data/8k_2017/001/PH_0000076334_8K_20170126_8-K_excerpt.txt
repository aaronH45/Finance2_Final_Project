 Item 8.01. Other Events.  

As previously disclosed, on December 1, 2016, Parker-Hannifin Corporation (“Parker”), Parker Eagle Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parker (“Merger Sub”), and CLARCOR Inc. (“Clarcor”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Clarcor, with Clarcor surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parker (the “pending Clarcor transaction”).  

On December 29, 2016, Parker filed merger control notifications with the competition authorities in Austria and Germany. The applicable review period in Austria expired at 11:59 p.m. on January 26, 2017. In Germany, early clearance was granted on January 26, 2017. The expiration of the review period in Austria and the granting of early clearance in Germany satisfy one of the conditions to the closing of the pending Clarcor transaction. The pending Clarcor transaction remains subject to other closing conditions, including approval by Clarcor’s stockholders. Based on the current date for Clarcor’s special meeting of stockholders on February 23, 2017, and subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions, the parties currently expect the pending Clarcor transaction to close on or about February 28, 2017.
