(i) expressly elect at the time of the delivery of the Shareholder Notice to have such Shareholder Nominee included in the Corporation’s proxy materials,

(ii) as of the date of the Shareholder Notice, own and continuously have owned during the three prior years at least three percent (3%) of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors (the “Required Shares”), and

(iii) satisfy the additional requirements in these Bylaws (an “Eligible Shareholder”).

(b) For purposes of qualifying as an Eligible Shareholder and satisfying the ownership requirements under Section 7(a):

(i) the outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation owned by one or more shareholders and beneficial owners that each shareholder and/or beneficial owner has owned continuously for at least three years as of the date of the Shareholder Notice may be aggregated, provided that the number of shareholders and Associated Persons whose ownership of shares is aggregated for such purpose shall not exceed twenty (20) and that any and all requirements and obligations for an Eligible Shareholder set forth in this Section 7 are satisfied by and as to each such shareholder and Associated Persons (except as noted with respect to aggregation or as otherwise provided in this Section 7), and

(ii) a group of funds that are (1) under common management and investment control, (2) under common management and funded primarily by the same employer, or (3) a “group of investment companies,” as such term is defined in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (a 

1

“Qualifying Fund”) shall be treated as one shareholder, provided that each fund included within a Qualifying Fund otherwise meets the requirements set forth in this Section 7.

(c) For purposes of this Section 7:

(i) A shareholder or beneficial owner shall be deemed to own only those outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation as to which such person possesses both (i) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (ii) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares; provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (i) and (ii) shall not include any shares (A) sold by such person or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, including any short sale, (B) borrowed by such person or any of its affiliates for any purposes or purchased by such person or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell, or (C) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, or other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such person or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of outstanding shares of Common Stock, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have the purpose or effect of (1) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such person’s or its affiliates’ full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (2) hedging, offsetting, or altering to any degree any gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such person or its affiliate.

(ii) A shareholder or beneficial owner shall be deemed to own shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the shareholder or beneficial owner retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A person’s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the person has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney, or other instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the person.

(iii) A shareholder or beneficial owner’s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the person has loaned such shares provided that the person has the power to recall such loaned shares on five business days’ notice and has recalled such loaned shares as of the date of the Shareholder Notice and through the date of the annual meeting.

Whether outstanding shares of the Corporation are owned for these purposes shall be determined by the Board.

(d) No shareholder or beneficial owner, alone or together with any Associated Person, may be a member of more than one group constituting an Eligible Shareholder under this Section 7.

(e) For purposes of this Section 7, the “Required Information” that the Corporation will include in its proxy statement is:

2

(i) the information concerning the Shareholder Nominee and the Eligible Shareholder that is required to be disclosed in the Corporation’s proxy statement by the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; and

(ii) if the Eligible Shareholder so elects, a written statement of the Eligible Shareholder, not to exceed 500 words, in support of each Shareholder Nominee, which must be provided at the same time as the Shareholder Notice for inclusion in the Corporation’s proxy statement for the annual meeting (the “Statement”).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7, the Corporation may omit from its proxy materials any information or Statement (or portion thereof) that the Corporation, in good faith, believes (i) would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation or listing standard, or (ii) is not true and correct in all material respects or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Nothing in this Section 7 shall limit the Corporation’s ability to solicit against and include in its proxy materials its own statements relating to any Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee.

(f) The Shareholder Notice shall include the following information:

(i) the written consent of each Shareholder Nominee to being named in the Corporation’s proxy materials as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected;

behalf of all such members with respect to the nomination and matters related thereto, including withdrawal of the nomination.

(g) To be timely under this Section 7, the Shareholder Notice must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the 120th day nor earlier than the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of the date the definitive proxy statement was first sent to shareholders in connection with the preceding year’s annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that in the event the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed by more than 60 days from such anniversary date, or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, to be timely the Shareholder Notice must be so delivered not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or (ii) the 10th day following the day on which the date of such meeting is first publicly announced by the Corporation. In no event shall an adjournment or recess of an annual meeting, or a postponement of an annual meeting for which notice has been given or with respect to which there has been a public announcement of the date of the meeting, commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of the Shareholder Notice.

(h) An Eligible Shareholder must:

(i) within five business days after the date of the Shareholder Notice, provide one or more written statements from the record holder(s) of the Required Shares and from each intermediary through which the Required Shares are or have been held, in each case during the requisite three year holding period, specifying the number of shares that the Eligible Shareholder owns, and has owned continuously, in compliance with this Section 7;

(ii) include in the Schedule 14N filed with the SEC a statement certifying that it owns and continuously has owned the Required Shares for at least three years;

(iii) file with the SEC any solicitation or other communication by or on behalf of the Eligible Shareholder relating to the Corporation’s annual meeting of shareholders, one or more of the Corporation’s directors or director nominees or any Shareholder Nominee, regardless of whether any such filing is required under Exchange Act Regulation 14A or whether any exemption from filing is available for such solicitation or other communication under Exchange Act Regulation 14A; and

(iv) as to any group of funds whose shares are aggregated for purposes of constituting an Eligible Shareholder, within five business days after the date of the Shareholder Notice, provide documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation that demonstrates that the funds satisfy Section 7(b)(ii).

The information provided pursuant to this Section 7(h) shall be deemed part of the Shareholder Notice for purposes of this Section 7.

(i) Within the time period prescribed in Section 7(g) for delivery of the Shareholder Notice, the Eligible Shareholder must also deliver to the Secretary of the Corporation at 

5

the principal executive offices of the Corporation a written representation and agreement (which shall be deemed part of the Shareholder Notice for purposes of this Section 7) signed by each Shareholder Nominee and representing and agreeing that such Shareholder Nominee:

(i) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement, or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such Shareholder Nominee, if elected as a director, will act or vote on any issue or question;

(ii) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement, or understanding with any person with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement, or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director that has not been disclosed to the Corporation;

(iii) if elected as a director, will comply with all of the Corporation’s corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality, and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines, and any other Corporation policies and guidelines applicable to directors; and

(iv) will not provide any non-public information regarding the Corporation to any third party other than the Corporation’s auditors, legal counsel or the SEC.

At the request of the Corporation, the Shareholder Nominee must promptly, but in any event within five business days after such request, submit (i) all completed and signed questionnaires required of the Corporation’s directors, (ii) a written consent to the Corporation’s following such processes for evaluation as the Corporation follows in evaluating any other potential Board Nominee, and (iii) such other information as the Corporation may reasonably request. The Corporation may request such additional information as necessary to permit the Board to determine if each Shareholder Nominee satisfies this Section 7.

(j) In the event that any information or communications provided by the Eligible Shareholder or any Shareholder Nominees to the Corporation or its shareholders is not, when provided, or thereafter ceases to be, true, correct and complete in all material respects (including omitting a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading), each Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the Secretary of the Corporation and provide the information that is required to make such information or communication true, correct, complete and not misleading; it being understood that providing any such notification shall not be deemed to cure any such defect or limit the Corporation’s right to omit a Shareholder Nominee from its proxy materials pursuant to this Section 7.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7, a Shareholder Nominee shall be disqualified from serving as a director of the Corporation, and the Corporation may omit any such Shareholder Nominee from its proxy materials, and such nomination shall be disregarded and no vote on such Shareholder Nominee will occur, 

6

notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation, if:

(i) the Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee breaches any of its respective agreements, representations, or warranties set forth in the Shareholder Notice (or otherwise submitted pursuant to this Section 7), any of the information in the Shareholder Notice (or otherwise submitted pursuant to this Section 7) was not, when provided, true, correct and complete, or the requirements of this Section 7 have otherwise not been met;

(ii) the Shareholder Nominee is not independent under the listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the shares of the Corporation are listed, any applicable rules of the SEC, and the Corporation’s Governance Principles;

(iii) the Shareholder Nominee is or has been, within the past three (3) years, an officer or director of a competitor, as defined in Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914;

(iv) the Shareholder Nominee is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses) or has been convicted in such a criminal proceeding within the past ten years;

(v) a notice is delivered to the Corporation (whether or not subsequently withdrawn) indicating that a shareholder intends to nominate any candidate for election to the Board pursuant to the Board’s director nomination process; 

(vi) the election of the Shareholder Nominee to the Board would cause the Corporation to be in violation of the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or any applicable state or federal law, rule, or regulation or any applicable listing standard.

(vii) the Shareholder Nominee has any interlocking relationships or affiliations prohibited by the rules and regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

(k) The maximum number of Shareholder Nominees that may be included in the Corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 7 shall not exceed the greater of (i) two or (ii) twenty percent (20%) of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a Shareholder Notice may be delivered pursuant to this Section 7 with respect to the annual meeting, or if such amount is not a whole number, the closest whole number below twenty percent (20%). If directors are to be elected at an annual meeting for terms of office longer than one year or until the next annual meeting, the maximum number of Shareholder Nominees that may be included in the Corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 7 shall not exceed the greater of (i) one or (ii) twenty percent (20%) of the number of directors to be elected at such annual meeting, or if such amount is not a whole number, the closest whole number below twenty percent (20%). However, the maximum number of Shareholder Nominees that may be included in the Corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 7 shall be reduced by any (i) Shareholder Nominee whose name was submitted for inclusion in the Corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 7 but either is subsequently withdrawn or that the Board of 

7

Directors decides to nominate as a Board nominee and (ii) any Shareholder Nominee elected to the Board of Directors at either of the two preceding annual meetings who are standing for reelection at the nomination of the Board of Directors. In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs after the deadline in Section 7(g) for delivery of the Shareholder Notice but before the annual meeting and the Board resolves to reduce the size of the Board in connection therewith, the maximum number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. In the event that the number of Shareholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Shareholders pursuant to this Section 7 exceeds this maximum number, the Corporation shall determine which Shareholder Nominees shall be included in the Corporation’s proxy materials in accordance with the following provisions: each Eligible Shareholder (or in the case of a group, each group constituting an Eligible Shareholder) will select one Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation’s proxy materials until the maximum number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of the Corporation each Eligible Shareholder disclosed as owned in its respective Shareholder Notice submitted to the Corporation. If the maximum number is not reached after each Eligible Shareholder (or in the case of a group, each group constituting an Eligible Shareholder) has selected one Shareholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the maximum number is reached. Following such determination, if any Shareholder Nominee who satisfies the eligibility requirements in this Section 7 is thereafter nominated by the Board, and thereafter is not included in the Corporation’s proxy materials or thereafter is not submitted for director election for any reason (including the Eligible Shareholder’s or Shareholder Nominee’s failure to comply with this Section 7), no other nominee or nominees shall be included in the Corporation’s proxy materials or otherwise submitted for director election in substitution thereof.

(l) Any Shareholder Nominee who is included in the Corporation’s proxy materials for a particular annual meeting of shareholders but either (i) withdraws from or becomes ineligible or unavailable for election at the annual meeting for any reason, including for the failure to comply with any provision of these Bylaws or (ii) does not receive votes at least equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares voting for director candidates, will be ineligible to be a Shareholder Nominee pursuant to this Section 7 for the next two annual meetings.

(m) The Board (and any other person or body authorized by the Board) shall have the power and authority to interpret this Section 7 and to make any and all determinations necessary or advisable to apply this Section 7 to any persons, facts or circumstances, including the power to determine (i) whether one or more shareholders or beneficial owners qualifies as an Eligible Shareholder, (ii) whether a Shareholder Notice complies with this Section 7 and has otherwise met the requirements of this Section 7, (iii) whether a Shareholder Nominee satisfies the qualifications and requirements in this Section 7, and (iv) whether any and all requirements of this Section 7 (or any applicable requirements of the Board’s director nomination process) have been satisfied. Any such interpretation or determination adopted in good faith by the Board (or any other person or body authorized by the Board) shall be binding on all persons, including the Corporation and its shareholders (including any beneficial owners). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7, unless otherwise required by law or otherwise determined by the chairman of the meeting or the Board, if (i) the Eligible Shareholder or (ii) a qualified representative of the shareholder does not appear at the annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation to present its Shareholder Nominee or Shareholder Nominees, such nomination or nominations shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of the election of the Shareholder Nominee or Shareholder Nominees may have 

8

been received by the Corporation. This Section 7 shall be the exclusive method for shareholders to include nominees for director election in the Corporation’s proxy materials.
