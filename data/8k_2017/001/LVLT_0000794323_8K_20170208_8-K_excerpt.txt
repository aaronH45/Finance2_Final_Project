Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition 

On February 8, 2017, Level 3 Communications, Inc. (“Level 3”) issued a press release relating to, among other things, fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial results, including certain full year 2017 financial projections. This press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated by reference as if set forth in full. The furnishing of this information shall not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of the information included in this Form 8-K. This information is not filed but is furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K. 

Some statements made in Exhibit 99.1 are forward-looking in nature and are based on management’s current expectations or beliefs. These forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of performance and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside Level 3’s control, which could cause actual events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the statements. Important factors that could prevent Level 3 from achieving its stated goals include, but are not limited to, the company’s ability to: increase revenue from its services to realize its targets for financial and operating performance; develop and maintain effective business support systems; manage system and network failures or disruptions; avert the breach of its network and computer system security measures; develop new services that meet customer demands and generate acceptable margins; manage the future expansion or adaptation of its network to remain competitive; defend intellectual property and proprietary rights; manage risks associated with continued uncertainty in the global economy; manage continued or accelerated decreases in market pricing for communications services; obtain capacity for its network from other providers and interconnect its network with other networks on favorable terms; successfully integrate future acquisitions; effectively manage political, legal, regulatory, foreign currency and other risks it is exposed to due to its substantial international operations; mitigate its exposure to contingent liabilities; and meet all of the terms and conditions of its debt obligations. Additional information concerning these and other important factors can be found within Level 3’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Statements in Exhibit 99.1 should be evaluated in light of these important factors. Level 3 is under no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any such obligation to, update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
