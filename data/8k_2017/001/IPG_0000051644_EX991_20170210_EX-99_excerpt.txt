"Across the board, 2016 was a successful year, in which we posted strong financial results, continued to build our digital and integrated offerings, and garnered the highest level of recognition for the creativity and effectiveness of our work in over a decade. We grew organically in every region of the world, with notably strong performance in the U.S., and with broad participation from across our agencies, disciplines and client sectors,” said Michael I. Roth, Interpublic’s Chairman and CEO. "Digital activity across the portfolio continues to be a significant driver of our results. We are well positioned to keep innovating, and to remain a vital partner in helping our clients navigate the complex marketing media environment. Of course,

we also demonstrated our continued ability to focus on and deliver improved profitability. Margin expansion and capital returns are powerful drivers of value for Interpublic going forward.”

Commenting on 2017 targets, Mr. Roth added, "Given our positive market momentum - having just concluded a three-year period of industry-leading organic revenue growth - we believe a competitive target of 3%-4% on this key metric is appropriate for 2017. We are also targeting an additional 50 basis points of operating margin improvement. We have a strong balance sheet and a commitment to returning capital to our owners, which is underscored by the actions our board announced today to increase the dividend and allocate additional funds for share repurchase. Combined with the breadth and strength of our professional offerings, there remains significant potential for enhancing shareholder value in the years to come.”
