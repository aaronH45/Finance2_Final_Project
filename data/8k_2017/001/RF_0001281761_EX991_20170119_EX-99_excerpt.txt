FOURTH QUARTER 2016 FINANCIAL RESULTS:

Selected items impacting earnings:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Based on income taxes at a 38.5% incremental rate.

During the fourth quarter, the company incurred $17 million of expenses related to the previously announced consolidation of 70 branches. The company will consolidate an additional 27 branches, which are expected to close in the second quarter of 2017. Since the fourth quarter of 2015, the company has consolidated or announced plans to consolidate 130 branches as part of its plan to consolidate at least 150 branches by the end of 2017. Also related to ongoing efficiency efforts, the company incurred $5 million of severance expense during the quarter.

During the fourth quarter, the company also made the decision to sell $171 million of affordable housing residential mortgage loans to Freddie Mac and recognized a gain of $5 million.

Total revenue

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* These market value adjustments relate to assets held for certain employee benefits, and are offset within salaries and employee benefits expense.

Comparison of fourth quarter 2016 to third quarter 2016

Total revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.40 billion in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $59 million. On an adjusted basis(1), total revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased $14 million or 1 percent. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $874 million, an increase of $18 million or 2 percent. The resulting net interest margin was 3.16 percent, an increase of 10 basis points. Net interest margin and net interest income and other financing income benefited from higher market interest rates, lower premium amortization on investment securities, a leveraged lease residual value adjustment incurred in the third quarter that did not repeat, and higher investment securities balances, partially offset by lower loan balances. Net interest margin benefited further from lower average cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.

Non-interest income totaled $522 million, a decrease of $77 million or 13 percent, primarily due to insurance proceeds recognized in the third quarter. On an adjusted basis(1), non-interest income decreased $32 million or 6 

5

percent. Continued growth in checking accounts contributed to a $7 million or 4 percent increase in service charges during the quarter. This increase was offset by declines in capital markets, wealth management income, mortgage income and other non-interest income. 

Following a record third quarter, capital markets income decreased $11 million or 26 percent during the quarter primarily due to lower merger and acquisition advisory services. Also following a record third quarter, wealth management income decreased $4 million or 4 percent during the quarter as lower income in insurance and investment services was partially offset by higher investment management & trust fees. Mortgage income decreased $3 million or 7 percent driven by seasonally lower production partially offset by increases in the market valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity. Within total mortgage production, 59 percent was related to purchase activity and 41 percent was related to refinancing. 

In addition, the company recognized a recovery of approximately $10 million in other non-interest income related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill during the third quarter that did not repeat in the fourth quarter. 

Comparison of fourth quarter 2016 to fourth quarter 2015

Total revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $26 million or 2 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. On an adjusted basis(1), total revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $28 million or 2 percent. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $18 million or 2 percent. The resulting net interest margin was 3.16 percent, an increase of 8 basis points. The fourth quarter of 2015 included the accounting reclassification of certain operating leases that were previously included in loans. The reclassification included an adjustment that lowered net interest income and other financing income by $15 million and reduced the net interest margin 5 basis points. Additionally, the current quarter net interest margin and net interest income and other financing income also benefited from higher market interest rates, a mix shift to higher yielding consumer loans, higher investment securities balances and the impact of hedging strategies. These benefits were partially offset by the reinvestment of fixed rate loans and securities at lower interest rates, higher borrowing costs and lower loan balances. Net interest margin benefited further from lower cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.

Non-interest income increased $8 million or 2 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. On an adjusted basis(1), non-interest income increased $10 million or 2 percent driven by revenue diversification initiatives with growth in almost every category. This growth was led by mortgage income, service charges and card & ATM income offset by lower net revenue from affordable housing investments.

Mortgage income increased $6 million or 16 percent due to higher gains from loan sales as well as higher loan servicing income, partially offset by declines in the market valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity. Also during the quarter, the company purchased the rights to service approximately $2.2 billion 

6

of mortgage loans bringing 2016 purchases to approximately $8.1 billion. Regions' mortgage portfolio serviced for others has increased from approximately $26 billion to $32 billion over the past year, which contributed to the increase in mortgage servicing income. 

Service charges increased $7 million or 4 percent aided by 2 percent growth in checking accounts, offsetting the impact of posting order changes implemented in early November 2015. Card & ATM income increased $7 million or 7 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to a 4 percent increase in debit card transactions. 

Capital markets income increased $3 million or 11 percent as the company experienced an increase in debt underwriting activity. In addition, wealth management income improved $3 million or 3 percent due to increased investment management and trust fees partially offset by a decline in investment services. 

Non-interest expense 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

7

Comparison of fourth quarter 2016 to third quarter 2016

Non-interest expense totaled $899 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $35 million or 4 percent. On an adjusted basis(1), non-interest expense totaled $877 million, a decrease of $35 million or 4 percent. Total salaries and benefits decreased $14 million primarily due to a decline in base salaries associated with one less weekday, the impact of staffing reductions, and decreased production-based incentives related to capital markets and commercial banking. 

Professional, legal and regulatory expenses decreased $3 million, primarily due to lower litigation-related costs. The company also recorded a $3 million credit for unfunded credit losses during the quarter resulting in an $11 million benefit compared to the third quarter. Additionally, in the third quarter the company incurred $11 million of expense related to Visa class B shares sold in a prior year that did not repeat. 

The company's efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter was 64.4 percent, or 63.2 percent on an adjusted basis(1), a 210 basis point improvement versus the prior quarter. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 31.2 percent compared to 32.3 percent in the third quarter. The effective tax rate for the full year of 2016 was 30.7 percent.

Comparison of fourth quarter 2016 to fourth quarter 2015

Non-interest expense increased $26 million or 3 percent from the fourth quarter of last year. Non-interest expense increased $16 million or 2 percent on an adjusted basis(1). Total salaries and benefits decreased $6 million or 1 percent as the impact of staffing reductions more than offset increased incentives related to revenue initiatives. Year-over-year, staffing levels have declined over 1,200 positions or 5 percent. 

FDIC insurance assessments increased $6 million or 27 percent from the prior year reflecting the implementation of the FDIC assessment surcharge that went into effect in the third quarter of 2016. Professional, legal and regulatory expenses increased $4 million or 18 percent. Occupancy expense decreased $2 million or 2 percent reflecting the company's ongoing branch consolidations. Expenses were also negatively impacted by $9 million from reduced credits related to unfunded commitments compared to the prior year. In addition, branch consolidation, property and equipment charges totaled $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Loans and Leases

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NM - Not meaningful.

Comparison of fourth quarter 2016 to third quarter 2016

Average loans and leases were $80.6 billion for the fourth quarter, a decrease of $694 million or 1 percent. Average balances in the consumer lending portfolio increased $329 million or 1 percent. The increase in average consumer loans was more than offset by a decline in the business lending portfolio as average balances decreased $1.0 billion or 2 percent.

Within the consumer lending portfolio, residential first mortgage balances increased $236 million or 2 percent. Indirect-other increased $110 million or 14 percent as the company continued to grow its point-of-sale portfolio. Consumer credit card balances increased $36 million or 3 percent as active credit cards increased 2 percent. Other consumer loans increased $28 million or 3 percent primarily due to growth in unsecured loans through the branch network. These increases were partially offset by declines in home equity balances of $64 million as the pace of run-off exceeded production. Indirect-vehicle lending balances decreased $17 million as a result of the company terminating a third-party arrangement during the fourth quarter that accounted for approximately one half of the company's production. The company is continuing to focus on its preferred dealer network. 

9

The company remains focused on achieving appropriate balance and diversity in its loan portfolio while improving risk-adjusted returns. Average business lending balances were impacted by the company's decision to reduce exposure in select portfolios based on concerns about increasing risk in certain industries and asset classes. Average direct energy loans declined $132 million or 6 percent and average investor real estate loans declined $307 million or 4 percent, driven by a $242 million or 12 percent reduction in multi-family loans. Soft demand and increasing competition for middle market and small business loans also impacted production. Despite these declines, the company continues to expect low single digit average business lending loan growth in 2017, driven in part by growth in the technology & defense, healthcare, power & utilities and asset-based lending portfolios. 

Comparison of fourth quarter 2016 to fourth quarter 2015

Average loans and leases were relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 as growth in the consumer lending portfolio essentially offset a decline in the business lending portfolio. 

The consumer lending portfolio experienced growth in almost every product category as average balances increased $1.2 billion or 4 percent from the prior year. Residential first mortgage balances increased $732 million or 6 percent. Indirect-other increased $366 million or 70 percent, as the company continued to execute its point-of-sale initiatives. Indirect-vehicle lending balances increased $127 million or 3 percent. Consumer credit card balances increased $115 million or 11 percent as active credit cards increased 11 percent, and the company’s penetration rate of deposit customers increased 110 basis points over the prior year to approximately 18.4 percent. In addition, other consumer loans increased $95 million or 9 percent primarily due to growth in unsecured loans through the branch network. These increases were partially offset by home equity balances which decreased $237 million as the pace of run-off continued to exceed production. 

Average business lending balances decreased $1.4 billion or 3 percent primarily due to declines in the direct energy and multi-family portfolios as well as owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. Average direct energy loans decreased $491 million or 19 percent and average multi-family investor real estate loans decreased $239 million or 12 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The declines in owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans reflect the softness in loan demand from middle market and small business customers, combined with the competitive market for this asset class.

Deposits

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Comparison of fourth quarter 2016 to third quarter 2016

Total average deposit balances were $98.5 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting an increase of $561 million or 1 percent compared to the prior quarter. Average low-cost deposits increased $503 million or 1 percent and represented 92 percent of average deposits. Deposit costs remained near historical lows at 13 basis points, and total funding costs were 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. 

Average deposits in the Consumer segment increased $452 million or 1 percent from the prior quarter. Average Corporate segment deposits increased $437 million or 2 percent, while average deposits in the Wealth Management segment declined $398 million or 4 percent as a result of ongoing strategic reductions of certain collateralized deposits.

Comparison of fourth quarter 2016 to fourth quarter 2015

Total average deposit balances increased $1.0 billion or 1 percent from the prior year. Average low-cost deposits increased $1.3 billion or 1 percent. Average deposits in the Consumer segment increased $2.7 billion or 5 percent from the prior year and average Corporate segment deposits increased $1.2 billion or 4 percent. Average deposits in the Wealth Management segment declined $2.3 billion or 18 percent.

* ALL excludes operating leases.

** Excludes guaranteed residential first mortgages that are 90+ days past due and still accruing. 

*** Business services represents the combined total of commercial and investor real estate loans.

Comparison of fourth quarter 2016 to third quarter 2016

Net charge-offs totaled $83 million or 0.41 percent of average loans during the quarter compared to $54 million or 0.26 percent of average loans in the previous quarter. The provision for loan losses was $35 million less than net charge-offs primarily attributable to improvement in the energy portfolio, the majority of fourth quarter commercial charge-offs having reserves established in prior quarters, and a reduction in loans outstanding. The resulting allowance for loan and lease losses decreased 3 basis points to 1.36 percent of total loans outstanding. Total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased 9 basis points to 1.24 percent of loans outstanding, and total business services criticized loans decreased 3 percent. Troubled debt restructured loans and total delinquencies increased 5 percent and 10 percent, respectively. 

Charge-offs related to the company’s direct energy portfolio totaled $14 million in the quarter. The allowance for loan and lease losses associated with the direct energy loan portfolio decreased to 7.0 percent in the fourth quarter compared to 7.9 percent in the third quarter as the company's exposure to direct energy continued to decline ending the year at 2.6 percent of total loans outstanding. Given the current phase of the credit cycle, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to large-dollar commercial credits and fluctuating commodity prices. 

The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non-accrual loans was approximately 110 percent at quarter end. Excluding direct energy, the allowance for loan losses, as a percent of non-accrual loans, or the adjusted coverage ratio(1), was 138 percent. 

12

Comparison of fourth quarter 2016 to fourth quarter 2015

Net charge-offs increased 6 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 and represented 0.41 percent of average loans compared to 0.38 percent in the prior year. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percent of total loans remained unchanged at 1.36 percent of total loans.

Total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased from 0.96 percent to 1.24 percent of loans outstanding, and total business lending criticized loans increased 7 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. These increases were driven primarily by downward risk rating migration in the energy portfolio. Troubled debt restructured loans increased 7 percent during the year primarily due to increases in direct energy and energy-related credits.

Capital and liquidity

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Under the Basel III capital rules, Regions’ estimated capital ratios remain well above current regulatory requirements. The Tier 1(2) and Common Equity Tier 1(2) ratios were estimated at 11.9 percent and 11.1 percent, respectively, at quarter-end under the phase-in provisions. In addition, the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio(1)(2) was estimated at 11.0 percent on a fully phased-in basis. 

During 2016, the company returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends to common shareholders. The company’s liquidity position remained solid with its loan-to-deposit ratio at the end of the quarter at 81 percent, and, as of quarter-end, the company remained fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule.

•Changes in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs, loan loss provisions or actual loan losses where our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses.

•Possible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to low interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization on those securities.

•Our ability to effectively compete with other financial services companies, some of whom possess greater financial resources than we do and are subject to different regulatory standards than we are.

Use of non-GAAP financial measures

Management uses the adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) and the adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP) to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the fee income ratio. Net interest income and other financing income on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the fee income and efficiency ratios. Regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions’ business. It is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur; however, management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.

The Company's allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-accrual loans, or coverage ratio is an important credit metric to many investors. Much of the Company's energy exposure is collateralized and therefore requires a lower specific allowance. Adjusting the Company's total allowance for loan losses to exclude the portion attributable to energy and excluding non-accrual energy loans produces an adjusted coverage ratio that management believes could be meaningful to investors. 

Tangible common stockholders’ equity ratios have become a focus of some investors and management believes they may assist investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions’ capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders’ equity measure. Because tangible common stockholders’ equity is not formally defined by GAAP or prescribed in any amount by federal banking regulations it is currently considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions’ disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions’ capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders’ equity, management believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions’ capital adequacy on this same basis.

The calculation of the fully phased-in pro-forma "Common equity Tier 1" (CET1) is based on Regions’ understanding of the Final Basel III requirements. For Regions, the Basel III framework became effective on a phased-in approach starting in 2015 with full implementation beginning in 2019. The calculation includes estimated pro-forma amounts for the ratio on a fully phased-in basis. Regions’ current understanding of the final framework includes certain assumptions, including the Company’s interpretation of the requirements, and informal feedback received through the regulatory process. Regions’ understanding of the framework is evolving and will likely change as analysis and discussions with regulators continue. Because Regions is not currently subject to the fully-phased in capital rules, this pro-forma measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure, and other entities may calculate it differently from Regions’ disclosed calculation. 

A company's regulatory capital is often expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Under the risk-based capital framework, a company’s balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories. The aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the prescribed risk-weighted percentage. The resulting weighted values from each of the categories are added together and this sum is the risk-weighted assets total that, as adjusted, comprises the denominator of certain risk-based capital ratios. CET1 capital is then divided by this denominator (risk-weighted assets) to determine the CET1 capital ratio. The amounts disclosed as risk-weighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements on a fully phased-in basis.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders.

Management and the Board of Directors utilize non-GAAP measures as follows:

•Preparation of Regions' operating budgets

•Monthly financial performance reporting

•Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)

•Presentation to investors of company performance
