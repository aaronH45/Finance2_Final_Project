FALLS CHURCH, Va. - General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) today reported fourth-quarter 2016 earnings from continuing operations of $807 million, a 5.6 percent increase over fourth-quarter 2015, on revenue of $8.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.62 compared to $2.40 in the year-ago quarter, a 9.2 percent increase.

“The quarter is solid showing strong growth over the year-ago quarter in both revenue and earnings and the same was true on a sequential basis. These themes played out throughout the business groups as well,” said Phebe Novakovic, chairman and chief executive officer. “The year was strong with growth in earnings, margins, return on sales and an 8.7 percent increase in EPS over the prior year."

PRELIMINARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION - (UNAUDITED)

DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS

(a)Return on equity is calculated by dividing earnings from continuing operations for the latest 12-month period by our average equity during that period.

(b)Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity as of the end of the period.

(c)Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity as of the end of the period.

(d)Book value per share is calculated as total equity divided by total outstanding shares as of the end of the period.

(e)Includes independent research and development and Aerospace product-development costs.

(f)Prior period information has been restated to reflect the reclassification of certain items in accordance with ASU 2016-09, which we adopted in the second quarter of 2016.

(g)We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to free cash flow from operations is net cash provided by operating activities.

(h)We believe return on invested capital (ROIC) is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders' equity for the year. ROIC excludes accumulated other comprehensive loss, goodwill impairments and non-economic accounting changes as they are not reflective of our operating performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to net operating profit after taxes is earnings from continuing operations. After-tax interest and amortization expense is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35 percent.

We recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order.

General Dynamics will provide its 2017 financial outlook on the financial results conference call, held at 9 a.m. EST, on Friday, January 27, 2017. 

The following exhibits present 2016 results restated to reflect Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 

These exhibits provide comparable information to help investors understand the 2017 financial outlook.

EXHIBIT K

REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING CHANGE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2017

We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, on January 1, 2017. ASC Topic 606 was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and requires the use of a five-step model for revenue recognition on our contracts.

ASC Topic 606 Impacts 

The majority of our long-term contracts will continue to recognize revenue and earnings over time as the work progresses. Adoption of the new standard has two notable impacts:

•We will use the cumulative catch-up method for recognizing adjustments in estimated profit on long-term contracts. The total impact of an adjustment in estimated profit recorded to date on a contract will be recognized in the period it is identified, rather than prospectively over the remaining contract term. Adjustments in contract estimates may be larger and more variable from period to period, particularly on our contracts of greater value and with a longer performance period (for example, in our Marine Systems group).

•For our contracts for the manufacture of Gulfstream business-jet aircraft, we will record revenue at a single point in time when control is transferred to the customer at entry into service as opposed to our past practice of recognizing revenue at two contractual milestones, green and outfitted aircraft delivery.

These accounting changes impact only the timing of when we recognize revenue and earnings. They will not alter the cash flows or overall profitability of our contracts.

Adoption Method

We adopted ASC Topic 606 using the retrospective transition method. The benefit of the retrospective method of adoption is that it permits comparisons from period to period since all periods are presented on the same basis of accounting. Therefore, selected 2016 financial information is presented reflecting the adoption of ASC Topic 606 in the following exhibits to provide comparability with our 2017 forecasted results.

Prior-period (2015 and 2016) financial information will be restated in our 2017 Form 10-Q and 10-K filings, as applicable. 

Other Financial Impacts

The revenue recognition accounting change is not expected to impact net cash provided by operating activities or free cash flow from operations. On the balance sheet, we anticipate some reclassifications between balance sheet accounts, but they are not expected to materially change the amount of net assets.

Additional information related to this change is contained in the company’s third-quarter 2016 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 26, 2016.
