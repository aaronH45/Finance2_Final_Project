Item 8.01 OTHER EVENTS  

On February 28, 2017, Patterson Companies, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a stock repurchase plan agreement established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), in connection with its previously disclosed board-authorized March 2013 plan to purchase up to 25 million shares through March 19, 2018. As of February 28, 2017, a total of approximately 14.5 million shares remain available for purchase under such repurchase authorization. A Rule 10b5-1 plan allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be unable to do so under the 1934 Act’s insider trading rules.  

The Company’s designated broker has authority under the Company’s 10b5-1 repurchase plan agreement (the “Plan”) to repurchase up to $30 million of the Company’s common stock through April 28, 2017, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Because the repurchases under the Plan will be subject to specified parameters and certain price and volume restraints as established in the Plan, there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased, or that there will be any repurchases at all pursuant to the Plan.
