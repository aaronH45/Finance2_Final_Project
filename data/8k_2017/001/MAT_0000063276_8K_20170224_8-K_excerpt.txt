Item 8.01 Other Events.  

On February 24, 2017 and February 27, 2017, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Mattel, Inc. (“Mattel”) Guidelines Concerning Rule 10b5-1(c) Individual Trading Plans (the “Guidelines”), the following executives of Mattel each entered into separate individual Rule 10b5-1(c) trading plans (individually, a “Plan” and collectively, the “Plans”) with a broker to sell shares of Mattel stock to be acquired upon the exercise of employee stock options (the “Options”). The Options have a 10-year term and will expire in 2017 or 2018. The first sales under the Plans will not take place until at least 30 days after the date each executive adopted his Plan.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The transactions under each Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each Plan was adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and with Mattel’s Guidelines.  

Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not aware of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock. Using these plans, individuals can gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time and better manage the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares.
