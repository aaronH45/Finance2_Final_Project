KIMBERLY-CLARK ANNOUNCES YEAR-END 2016 RESULTS AND 2017 OUTLOOK

DALLAS, January 24, 2017-Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE: KMB) today reported year-end 2016 results and provided its 2017 outlook and related key planning assumptions.

Executive Summary

•Fourth quarter 2016 net sales of $4.5 billion were even with the prior year. Organic sales increased 1 percent, including 3 percent growth in developing and emerging markets. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by 1 percent. 

•Diluted net income per share for the fourth quarter was $1.40 in 2016 and $0.91 in 2015. The comparison benefited from cost savings and a charge in 2015 related to deconsolidating the company’s Venezuelan business at the end of 2015. 

•Full-year diluted net income per share was $5.99 in 2016 and $2.77 in 2015.

•Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.45 in 2016 and $1.42 in 2015. Adjusted earnings per share exclude certain items described later in this news release.

•Full-year adjusted earnings per share were $6.03 in 2016, up 5 percent compared to $5.76 in 2015. The company’s previous guidance for adjusted earnings per share was $5.95 to $6.05.

•Full-year 2016 cash provided by operations was $3.2 billion, up 40 percent year-on-year. 

•Net sales in 2017 are expected to be similar to 2016, including organic sales growth of approximately 2 percent. Diluted net income per share for 2017 is anticipated to be $6.20 to $6.35.

•The company’s Board of Directors has approved a 5.4 percent increase in the quarterly dividend, taking the dividend to 97 cents per share, up from 92 cents per share in 2016. This is the 45th consecutive annual increase in the company’s dividend. The dividend will be payable on April 4, 2017, to stockholders of record on March 10, 2017. 

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas J. Falk said, “Our full-year results were consistent with our previous outlook. While we experienced a challenging economic and competitive environment in 2016, our market share positions remained broadly healthy. We also achieved record cost savings, which helped us improve our margins and deliver bottom-line earnings in line with our guidance for the year. In addition, we generated strong cash flow and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.”

Falk added, “Looking to 2017, we will execute our Global Business Plan strategies in what we expect will be a continued difficult environment. Our teams will invest in innovation, marketing and

targeted growth initiatives to keep our brands strong and help us compete effectively. We will also continue to manage our company with financial discipline, with a focus on cost savings, cash flow and shareholder-friendly capital allocation. We remain optimistic about our opportunities to create long-term shareholder value.” 

Fourth Quarter 2016 Operating Results

Sales of $4.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 were even with the year-ago period. Organic sales were up 1 percent, as volumes increased 2 percent, while the combined impact of changes in net selling prices and product mix reduced sales by 1 percent. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates lowered sales 1 percent. 

Fourth quarter operating profit was $839 million in 2016 and $630 million in 2015. Results in 2015 included $108 million of charges for the Venezuelan deconsolidation. Adjusted operating profit of $859 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 10 percent compared to $779 million in the year-ago period. Items excluded from adjusted operating profit are described later in this release.

The year-over-year operating profit comparison included benefits from $140 million in cost savings from the company’s FORCE (Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere) program and $25 million of savings from the 2014 Organization Restructuring. Input costs decreased $5 million, driven by lower fiber costs. Negative foreign currency translation effects reduced operating profit by $5 million. Other manufacturing-related cost increases and foreign currency transaction effects also negatively impacted the operating profit comparison. 

The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 35.7 percent in 2016 compared to 45.1 percent in 2015, which included the impact of a $49 million charge as a result of an updated assessment of uncertain tax positions. The fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 35.4 percent in 2016 and 30.6 percent in 2015. The full-year 2016 effective tax rate and adjusted effective tax rate of 30.6 percent and 30.7 percent, respectively, were both relatively consistent with the company’s previous estimate for a rate approximately at the low end of the 30.5 to 32.5 percent range.

Kimberly-Clark’s share of net income of equity companies in the fourth quarter was $29 million in 2016 and $37 million in 2015. At Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, results were impacted by a weaker Mexican peso and higher input costs, partially offset by benefits from organic sales growth and cost savings.

Cash Flow and Balance Sheet

Cash provided by operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $871 million, up 31 percent versus $665 million in the year-ago period. Full-year cash provided by operations was $3,232 million in 2016, an increase of 40 percent compared to $2,306 million in 2015. The increase was driven by improved working capital and lower pension contributions. Full-year defined benefit pension plan contributions were $108 million in 2016 and $485 million in 2015. 

Capital spending for the fourth quarter was $189 million in 2016 and $258 million in 2015. Full-year spending was $771 million in 2016 and $1,056 million in 2015. Fourth quarter 2016 share

repurchases were 1.9 million shares at a cost of $225 million, bringing full-year repurchases to 6.0 million shares at a cost of $750 million. Total debt was $7.6 billion at the end of 2016 and $7.8 billion at the end of 2015.

Child care and adult volumes each rose high-single digits, with benefits from category growth and innovations launched in the last 12 months. Baby wipes volumes increased mid-single digits and market shares improved.

Operating profit was $3,317 million in 2016 versus $1,613 million in 2015.

Results in 2016 included benefits from organic sales growth, $435 million of FORCE cost savings and $70 million of savings from the 2014 Organization Restructuring. In addition, input costs were $65 million lower. Translation effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates lowered operating profit by $90 million and transaction effects also negatively impacted results. 

Diluted net income per share was $5.99 in 2016 and $2.77 in 2015. Adjusted earnings per share of $6.03 in 2016 increased 5 percent versus $5.76 in 2015.

2014 Organization Restructuring

In October 2014, Kimberly-Clark initiated a restructuring program in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spin-off of the company’s health care business. The restructuring was intended to improve underlying profitability and increase flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives, brand building and other capabilities critical to delivering future growth.

Charges for the restructuring were completed at the end of 2016, as expected. Total costs were $164 million after tax ($231 million pre-tax) compared to the original estimate of $130 to $160 million after tax ($190 to $230 million pre-tax). The company achieved its total restructuring savings objective one year ahead of target, as annualized pre-tax savings from the restructuring amounted to $140 million through the end of 2016 compared to the original estimate for savings of $120 to $140 million by the end of 2017.

2017 Outlook and Key Planning Assumptions

The company’s key planning and guidance assumptions for 2017 are as follows:

•Net sales similar to the prior year.

•Organic sales growth of approximately 2 percent, driven by higher volumes. Net selling prices and product mix expected to be similar, or up slightly, year-on-year.

•Negative foreign currency exchange rate impact of 2 percent. 

•Operating profit up 2 to 4 percent compared to adjusted operating profit in 2016. 

•Cost savings of at least $400 million from the company’s FORCE program.

•Negative foreign currency translation effects of 2 percent. Currency transaction effects are also anticipated to negatively impact comparisons.

•Impact of changes in key cost inputs between $50 and $200 million of inflation, primarily due to inflation in international markets. The company is assuming North American market prices of $830 to $850 per metric ton for eucalyptus pulp and $50 to $60 per barrel for oil. 

•Interest expense down slightly compared to 2016.

•Effective tax rate similar to 2016’s adjusted effective tax rate of 30.7 percent.

•Net income from equity companies expected to decline due to lower income at K-C de Mexico as a result of a weaker Mexican peso.

•Diluted net income per share of $6.20 to $6.35 compared to $5.99 in 2016, and up 3 to 5 percent versus adjusted earnings per share of $6.03 in 2016.

•Capital spending of $850 to $950 million.

•Defined benefit pension plan contributions of up to $100 million.

•Dividend increase of 5.4 percent (approved by the Board of Directors and mentioned previously in this release).

•Share repurchases between $800 and $1,000 million, subject to market conditions.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release and the accompanying tables include the following financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measures:

•Adjusted earnings and earnings per share

•Adjusted gross and operating profit

•Adjusted other (income) and expense, net

•Adjusted effective tax rate

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the accompanying non-GAAP reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures:

•2014 Organization Restructuring. See previous discussion in this news release.

•Venezuelan operations. In the first quarter of 2015, following the Venezuelan government’s elimination of the SICAD II exchange rate, the company recorded a charge for remeasuring the local currency balance sheet in Venezuela at the SIMADI floating exchange rate. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the company recorded a charge related to deconsolidating the company’s Venezuelan business at the end of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, the company recorded a modest amount of income related to an updated assessment of the impact of the deconsolidation.

•Pension settlement charges. In 2015, the company started to offer a lump-sum pension benefit payout option for certain plan participants. In addition, Kimberly-Clark purchased group annuity contracts that transferred to two insurance companies the pension benefit obligations for certain Kimberly-Clark retirees. As a result, the company recognized pension settlement charges in 2015, mostly in the second quarter.

•Uncertain tax positions. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the company recognized a charge, related to prior years, as a result of an updated assessment of uncertain tax positions for certain international operations.

•Turkey Restructuring. In 2015, the company initiated actions to restructure its business in Turkey, including the closing of a manufacturing facility. 

The company provides these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental information to our GAAP financial measures. Management and the company's Board of Directors use adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted gross and operating profit to (a) evaluate the company's historical and prospective financial performance and its performance relative to its competitors, (b) allocate resources and (c) measure the operational performance of the company's business units and their managers. Management also believes that the use of an adjusted effective tax rate provides improved insight into the tax effects of our ongoing business operations.

Additionally, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the company's Board of Directors has used certain of the non-GAAP financial measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals. These goals are based, in part, on the company's adjusted earnings per share and improvement in the company's adjusted return on invested capital and adjusted operating profit return on sales determined by excluding certain of the charges that are used in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures.

This news release includes information regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, net selling prices and product mix on net sales. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also impact the year-over-year change in net sales.
