Express Scripts Announces 2016 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results  

ST. LOUIS, February 14, 2017 — Express Scripts Holding Company (Nasdaq: ESRX) announced 2016 fourth quarter and full year net income of $1,434.7 million and $3,404.4 million, respectively, or $2.34 and $5.39 per diluted share, respectively. 2016 fourth quarter and full year adjusted earnings per diluted share, as detailed in Table 4, was $1.88 and $6.39, respectively.1  

“We delivered another year of successful performance, not only through financial results, but by providing innovative solutions to help our patients and clients drive healthier outcomes and lower drug trends,” said Tim Wentworth, CEO and President. “In a year when the focus on drug pricing has never been greater, Express Scripts has held the 2016 growth rate in drug unit costs to 2.5% and lowered the patients’ share of total drug costs per prescription. The fundamentals of our business remain strong as our clinical focus and unwavering alignment with clients enables us to lead the industry in developing innovative value-based solutions that our country needs.”  

In October 2016, we recognized a previously disclosed net tax benefit of approximately $511.0 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, related to the disposition of PolyMedica Corporation (Liberty). Following receipt of the tax benefit proceeds, the Board of Directors authorized the use of $41.2 million, approximately 8%, or $0.04 per share net of tax, of the PolyMedica tax benefit proceeds to reward employees for the significant contribution this multi-year effort provided the Company and its shareholders. This special, one-time, payment is excluded from our fourth quarter and full year 2016 adjusted SG&A, which impacts adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share.  

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Review  

The following compares fourth quarter 2016 and 2015 operating results:  

   •   Adjusted claims of 354.9 million, down 6%, largely due to roll-off of the Coventry business – See Table 1

Including shares received under our accelerated share repurchase agreements (executed in February 2016 and April 2015), the Company repurchased a total of 74.4 million shares under our share repurchase program for $5,571.9 million during 2016. In December 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an increase in the authorized number of shares that may be repurchased under the share repurchase program by an additional 65.0 million shares.  

As discussed publicly in December 2016, the Company revised its methodology for reporting adjusted network claims beginning with the year ending December 31, 2016. Specifically, the revised methodology includes an adjustment to reflect non-specialty network claims filled through our 90-day programs. These claims are now multiplied by three, as these claims, on average, typically cover a time period three times longer than other network claims. The change was made retrospectively for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 and for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, to facilitate a year-over-year comparison. A recast to the revised methodology is presented in the attached appendix and at the Investor Information section of Express Scripts’ web site at http://www.express-scripts.com/corporate.  

2017 Guidance  

The Company reaffirms its 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance in the range of $6.82 to $7.02, which represents growth of 8% over 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share results at the mid-point of the range. The Company expects total adjusted claims for the first quarter of 2017 to be in the range of 345 million to 355 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017 is estimated to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.34, which represents growth of 7% to 10% over the first quarter of 2016. Additional details on this guidance can be found in Table 6. For a discussion of the financial measures presented herein which are not calculated or presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), see “Supplemental Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.  

The Company will hold its quarterly conference call to discuss 2016 fourth quarter and full year financial results on Wednesday, February 15, 2017, at 8:30 a.m. EST (7:30 a.m. CST). The call includes a slide presentation and is being webcast via the Internet and can be accessed at the Investor Relations section of Express Scripts’ web site at http://www.express-scripts.com/corporate.

Supplemental Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

The following provides supplemental information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures presented herein, including the reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA per adjusted claim, adjusted net income, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted gross profit and adjusted selling, general and administrative are non-GAAP financial measures presented herein, are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide management and investors with useful information about the earnings impact of certain expenses and are useful for (i) comparison of our earnings to those of other companies; (ii) a better understanding of the Company’s ongoing core performance; (iii) planning and forecasting for future periods; and (iv) assessing period-to-period performance trends. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA also provide a useful basis for assessing the Company’s ability to fund both its operating activities and reinvestments into the business, as well as service indebtedness. Management assesses the Company’s operating performance using EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in order to better isolate the impact of certain expenses that may not be comparable between periods or indicative of the ongoing performance of our core operations. Adjusted EBITDA per adjusted claim provides management and investors with useful information about the earnings and performance of the Company on a per unit basis.  

2017 Guidance Information: Due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amount of certain items that would impact EPS and net income, including discrete tax items, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the related impact of such items to EPS and net income, the GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to adjusted EPS and EBITDA, respectively. Accordingly, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of 2017 guidance for either adjusted EPS to EPS or EBITDA to net income. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a significant impact on the Company’s first quarter and full-year 2017 GAAP financial results. With respect to adjusted EPS, amortization of intangible assets is expected to be approximately $0.38 and $1.54 per share for the first quarter and full-year 2017, respectively.

Footnotes  

(1) Includes home delivery, specialty and other including: (a) drugs distributed through patient assistance programs, (b) drugs distributed to clients of other PBMs under limited distribution contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers and (c) Freedom Fertility claims.  

(2) Total adjusted network claims includes an adjustment to reflect non-specialty network claims filled through our 90-day programs. These claims are now multiplied by three, as these claims, on average, typically cover a time period three times longer than other network claims. Home delivery claims are also multiplied by three, consistent with prior practice, as home delivery claims typically cover a time period three times longer than unadjusted network claims. All other network and specialty claims are counted as one claim. The change was made retrospectively for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 and for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, to facilitate a year-over-year comparison. See Appendix, Schedule A. 

(3) Amortization of intangible assets includes the following items:  

Amortization of legacy Express Scripts, Inc. (“ESI”) intangible assets include amounts in both revenues and selling, general and administrative expense.  

Revenue amortization is related to the customer contract with Anthem, which commenced upon closing of the NextRx acquisition in 2009. Amortization of intangibles that arises in connection with consideration given to a customer by a vendor is characterized as a reduction of revenues. Intangible amortization of $55.4 million ($34.8 million net of tax) and $23.7 million ($14.8 million net of tax) is included as a reduction to revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Intangible amortization of $200.5 million ($126.1 million net of tax) and $95.1 million ($59.4 million net of tax) is included as a reduction to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company’s 10-year agreement with Anthem under which we provide pharmacy benefit management services to Anthem and its designated affiliates was previously amortized using a modified pattern of benefit method over an estimated useful life of 15 years. Beginning in March 2016, we began amortizing our agreement with Anthem over the remaining term of the contract (i.e., using a modified pattern of benefit over an estimated useful life of 10 years from the time the agreement was executed in 2009), which resulted in an additional $31.7 million of revenue amortization recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and $105.6 million of revenue amortization recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016.  

Other legacy ESI intangible amortization of $7.9 million ($5.0 million net of tax) and $9.4 million ($5.9 million net of tax) for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is included in selling, general and administrative expense. Other legacy ESI intangible amortization of $36.2 million ($22.8 million net of tax) and $37.7 million ($23.5 million net of tax) for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is included in selling, general and administrative expense.  

Amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Medco of $398.8 million ($250.8 million net of tax) and $399.5 million ($249.5 million net of tax) for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is included in selling, general and administrative expense. Amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Medco of $1,596.1 million ($1,004.1 million net of tax) and $1,598.1 million ($997.4 million net of tax) for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is included in selling, general and administrative expense.  

(4) Transaction and integration costs include those costs directly related to the acquisition of Medco Health Solutions, Inc.  

Costs of $77.4 million ($48.4 million net of tax) are primarily composed of integration-related activities, and are included in gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Costs of $218.0 million ($136.1 million net of tax) are primarily composed of integration-related activities, and are included in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Costs of $101.6 million ($63.4 million net of tax) are primarily composed of professional fees, integration-related activities and severance costs, and are included in selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Costs of $298.8 million ($186.5 million net of tax) are primarily composed of professional fees, integration-related activities and severance costs, and are included in selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

(5) Costs of $41.2 million ($25.9 million net of tax) are related to compensation in connection with the previously disclosed net tax benefit of approximately $511.0 million related to the disposition of PolyMedica Corporation (Liberty). Following receipt of the tax benefit proceeds, the Board of Directors authorized the use of $41.2 million, approximately 8%, or $0.06 per share ($0.04 per share net of tax), of the PolyMedica tax benefit proceeds to reward employees for the significant contribution this multi-year effort provided the Company and its shareholders.  

(6) Charge related to a legal settlement of $60.0 million ($37.5 million net of tax) is included in selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

(7) Provision for income taxes includes discrete tax benefits of $598.2 million and $633.9 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively, and discrete tax benefits of $92.2 million and discrete tax charges of $79.2 million for the three months and year ended December 31 2015, respectively. The 2016 net discrete tax benefits and 2015 net discrete tax charges relate primarily to changes in unrecognized tax benefits. In October 2016, we recognized a previously disclosed impact from a net tax benefit of approximately $511.0 million related to the disposition of PolyMedica Corporation (Liberty).  

(8) Debt redemption costs, which include write-off of discounts, premiums, deferred financing costs, and other costs incurred for the early redemption of senior notes, totaled $135.6 million ($85.3 million net of tax) and are included in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. Debt redemption costs, which include write-off of deferred financing fees incurred for the early repayment of the 2011 term loan, totaled $9.2 million ($5.7 million net of tax) and are included in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

(9) Represents adjustment for the tax impact related to non-GAAP items excluded from adjusted diluted EPS. See Table 5 and 5A for calculation of adjusted effective income tax rate.
