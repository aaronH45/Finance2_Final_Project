Consolidated Results 

The company’s three months and year ended results are included in the table below.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In the fourth quarter 2016, income from continuing operations increased $0.02 per diluted share compared to the prior year. Net income from the Regulated Businesses was up $0.01 per diluted share with continued strong revenue growth partially offset by the timing of certain operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses. Net income from the Market-based Businesses was up $0.01 per diluted share primarily due to price redeterminations in the Military Services Group.  

For the full year 2016, GAAP income from continuing operations decreased $0.02 per diluted share compared to the prior year. Included in the 2016 amount was an after-tax charge of $39 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, related to the Settlement. Excluding the impact of the Settlement, net income was $2.84, up 7.6 percent mainly due to the Regulated Businesses from additional authorized revenue from investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Although the Military Services Group was able to offset some of the previously discussed headwinds, net income in the Market-based Businesses was slightly down for the year.  

On Oct. 31, 2016, a federal court in West Virginia approved the preliminary principles, terms and conditions of a binding global agreement in principle to settle all consolidated claims in both federal and state courts arising from the Freedom Industries chemical spill on Jan. 9, 2014. The Settlement is not an admission of any liability or fault on the part of the company or its employees. The Settlement resulted in a $39 million, or $0.22 per share, after-tax charge recognized in the third quarter.  

For the full year 2016, the company made capital investments of approximately $1.5 billion, a record level of investment, including $1.3 billion to improve infrastructure in the Regulated Businesses to provide safe, clean and reliable service to its customers and over $199 million for regulated acquisitions.  

Regulated Businesses 

For the fourth quarter 2016, net income in the Regulated Businesses was $98 million, compared to $96 million for the same period in 2015. These results were driven by additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Partially offsetting increased revenue was higher O&M expense, largely due to timing of certain maintenance, repairs, and tank painting completed in the fourth quarter of 2016.  

For the full year 2016, net income was $472 million, compared to $473 million for the same period in 2015. Excluding the $39 million after-tax impact of the Settlement, adjusted net income (a non-GAAP financial measure) for 2016 was $511 million, up $38 million from prior year. These results were primarily due to revenue growth of $128 million to support continued infrastructure investments to benefit customers, and acquisitions and organic growth, partially offset by higher depreciation expense from increased infrastructure investments.  

For the full year 2016, the company received approximately $92 million in additional annualized authorized revenues from general rate cases, step increases, and infrastructure charges. Following the close of 2016, the company also received approximately $3 million in additional annualized revenues from infrastructure surcharges and approximately $31 million from general rate cases. The company is awaiting final orders or proposed settlements for general rate cases in four states, requesting approximately $57 million in total additional revenues, $5 million step increases, and $10 million in infrastructure surcharges. The extent to which requested rate increases will be granted by the applicable regulatory agencies will vary.  

For the full year 2016, adjusted O&M efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure) improved to 34.9 percent, compared to 35.9 percent for the full year of 2015. By reducing O&M expense as a proportion of revenue, American Water is able to make investments in needed capital improvements without significantly impacting customer bills.

Market-based Businesses 

For the fourth quarter of 2016, net income in the Market-based Businesses was $13 million, compared to $11 million for the same period in 2015. The Military Services Group was able to overcome previously discussed headwinds with price redeterminations and the 2016 addition of Vandenberg Air Force Base.  

For the full year 2016, net income was $39 million, compared to $42 million for the same period in 2015. Although revenue at the Homeowner Services Group was higher by $11 million, it was more than offset by higher claims, marketing expenses, and costs associated with an investment in a new customer information system. Also, Keystone Clearwater results for the year were essentially earnings neutral, as anticipated. 

Dividends 

On Dec. 9, 2016, American Water’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.375 per share of common stock, payable on Mar. 1, 2017, to all stockholders of record as of Feb. 7, 2017.  

American Water’s dividend has increased at the top end of its long-term 7 to 10 percent EPS compound annual growth range over the last four years. As the company continues to execute on its strategy and earnings growth, it expects 2017 dividend growth to be at the top of the long term EPS growth range. Future dividends are subject to approval of the American Water Board of Directors. 

2017 Earnings Guidance 

American Water has affirmed its 2017 earnings guidance from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.98 - $3.08 per diluted share. The company’s earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below and under “Risk Factors” in its annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This press release includes a presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These items constitute “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. These non-GAAP financial measures are derived from American Water’s consolidated financial information but are not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are defined as GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and diluted earnings per common share, respectively, in each case excluding the impact of the Settlement in the third quarter of 2016. These non-GAAP financial measures supplement the company’s GAAP disclosures and should not be considered alternatives to the GAAP measures. 

Management uses adjusted earnings per share to evaluate the company’s period-over-period performance and as a performance goal in both the company’s annual and long-term compensation programs, and believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to the company’s investors because it provides an indication of the company’s baseline performance excluding an item that is not considered to be reflective of ongoing results. Management does not intend results excluding the adjustment to represent results as defined by GAAP, and the reader should not consider them as indicators of the company’s performance. The company’s definition of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to the same or similar measures used by other companies, and, accordingly, they may have significant limitations on their use. 

This press release also includes a presentation of the adjusted Regulated O&M efficiency ratio, which excludes from its calculation estimated purchased water revenues and purchased water expenses, the impact of the Settlement, the impact of abnormal weather, and the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes. This item constitutes a “non-GAAP financial measure” under SEC rules. This item is derived from American Water’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure supplements and should be read in conjunction with the company’s GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to any GAAP measure. 

Management believes that the presentation of this measure is useful to investors because it provides a means of evaluating the company’s operating performance without giving effect to items that are not reflective of management’s ability to increase efficiency of the company’s regulated operations. In preparing operating plans, budgets and forecasts, and in assessing historical performance, management relies, in part, on trends in the company’s historical results, exclusive of estimated revenues and expenses related to purchased water, abnormal weather, the Settlement and the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs. The company’s definition of this metric may not be comparable to the same or similar measures used by other companies, and, accordingly, this non-GAAP financial measure may have significant limitations on its use. 

Set forth in this release are tables that reconcile adjusted earnings per share and the components used to calculate adjusted O&M efficiency ratio to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
