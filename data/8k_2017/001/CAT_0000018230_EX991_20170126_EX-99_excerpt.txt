4Q 2016 Earnings Release

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Caterpillar Reports 2016 Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year Financial Results; 

Provides Outlook for 2017

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

PEORIA, Ill. - Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) today announced fourth-quarter and full-year results for 2016. 

Sales and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $9.6 billion, down from $11.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth-quarter 2016 was a loss of $2.00 per share, compared with a loss of $0.16 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Full-year sales and revenues in 2016 were $38.5 billion, down about 18 percent from $47.0 billion in 2015. The company lost $0.11 per share in 2016, compared with a profit of $4.18 per share in 2015.

Our fourth-quarter 2016 results included three large non-cash charges and higher than expected restructuring costs. These items resulted in a loss for the quarter and were the primary reason our results were lower than the outlook provided in October 2016. A discussion of these items - mark-to-market losses for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans, a goodwill impairment charge, a deferred tax valuation allowance and restructuring costs - and their applicable impact on each period is in Q&A #1 on page 16. Because we do not consider these items to be indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities, the table above shows adjusted profit per share that excludes them. We believe adjusted profit per share provides a useful perspective on underlying business results and period-over-period changes.

Adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $0.83, the same as the fourth quarter of 2015, but higher than the outlook for profit per share excluding restructuring costs provided in October 2016. Adjusted profit per share in 2016 was $3.42, down from $5.35 per share in 2015. For the year, the impact on profit from lower sales and revenues was mitigated by a $2.3 billion reduction in period costs and variable manufacturing costs.

“Our results for the fourth quarter, while slightly better than expected, continued to reflect pressure in many of our end markets from weak economic conditions around much of the world. Our team did a great job in the quarter, as they have all year, aligning our cost structure with current demand while preserving capacity for the future. I’m confident we are focusing on the right areas: controlling costs, maintaining a strong balance sheet and investing in the key areas important to our future,” said Caterpillar Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby.

2017 Outlook - Background

Positives

We are seeing positive signs that could be early indications of modest recovery in several of our businesses. 

Resource Industries - Commodity prices at higher levels than a year ago, along with sequential improvements in parts sales in each of the last three quarters and improvements in quoting and order activity in the fourth quarter, suggest that mining-related sales may have bottomed. 

Construction Industries - Sales in China began recovering in 2016; sales in Europe seem to have stabilized and could improve some in 2017; and sales in Brazil, which are off their peak by over 80 percent, could improve if the Brazilian economy begins to recover from recession. 

Energy & Transportation - Gas compression remains strong, and we have a solid backlog for turbines. If oil prices rise modestly and stabilize, it would be positive for our businesses that support drilling and well servicing. 

Prospects for tax reform and an infrastructure spending bill in the United States are encouraging. While these initiatives would likely be a solid positive for many of our businesses, we would not expect to begin to see meaningful effects of these changes until sometime in 2018.

Concerns

Resource Industries - While quoting interest in mining products has improved, we are expecting miners’ capital spending to be about flat in 2017 after several years of decline. Sales of some large construction equipment within Resource Industries are likely to be down in 2017, compared with 2016.

Construction Industries - North America and EAME are the most concerning regions. While better economic growth and increased infrastructure spending may be on the horizon, the availability of used equipment has negatively impacted sales in North America during 2016 and we expect some negative impact in 2017. We expect sales in Africa/Middle East to be down again in 2017 due to overall economic weakness and continued pressure on economies that rely on oil revenues to drive economic growth. In addition, continuing uncertainty related to Brexit remains a concern in Europe.

Energy & Transportation - Rail remains challenged with low traffic volume and a significant number of idle locomotives. Additionally, weakness in shipbuilding is expected to be negative for our marine-related sales; power generation sales are projected to remain weak; and industrial engine sales to original equipment manufacturers are expected to be lower than 2016. 

2017 Outlook - Sales and Revenues and Profit

Our expectations for 2017 are similar to those shared with investors in early December 2016. At that time, we believed the analyst consensus for 2017 sales and revenues of about $38 billion was a reasonable midpoint expectation. Our expectation for sales and revenues in 2017 are now slightly lower due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past two months, and as a result, our current outlook for sales and revenues in 2017 is a range of $36 billion to $39 billion with a midpoint of $37.5 billion.

We expect profit per share of about $2.30 at the midpoint of the sales and revenues outlook range. Excluding restructuring costs of about $500 million, we expect adjusted profit of about $2.90 per share at the midpoint, which reflects decremental operating profit pull through of about 30 percent from 2016. 

“We continue to execute in a challenging economic environment and are focused on improving operating margins, profitability and shareholder returns. While we see signs of positive activity in some of our key end markets, the overall economic environment remains challenging,” added Umpleby.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

Consolidated Sales and Revenues

The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between the fourth quarter of 2015 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2016 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees.

Sales and Revenues

Total sales and revenues were $9.574 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decline of $1.456 billion, or 13 percent, compared with $11.030 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease was almost entirely due to lower sales volume, resulting from lower end-user demand attributable to continued weak commodity prices globally and economic weakness in many countries. Although some commodity prices improved in the fourth quarter of 2016, the improvement was too recent to significantly impact our sales for the quarter. Sales for new equipment declined, while aftermarket parts sales were about flat. The unfavorable impact of price realization also contributed to the decline. 

Sales declined in all regions except Asia/Pacific. In EAME, sales declined 30 percent primarily in Africa/Middle East due to weak economic conditions resulting from the continuing impact of low oil prices and an uncertain investment environment. In North America, sales decreased 15 percent primarily due to lower end-user demand for equipment used for infrastructure, the impact of continued low oil prices and an uncertain economic environment. Sales decreased 16 percent in Latin America primarily due to continued widespread economic weakness and inflation across the region. Asia/Pacific sales increased 10 percent primarily due to increased infrastructure and residential investment in China. 

Energy & Transportation’s sales declined 15 percent largely due to lower end-user demand for most applications. Resource Industries’ sales declined 23 percent mostly due to continued low end-user demand. Construction Industries’ sales decreased 8 percent primarily due to lower demand from end users, partially offset by favorable changes in dealer inventories. Financial Products’ segment revenues were about flat with the fourth quarter of 2015.

Consolidated Operating Profit / (Loss)

The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit (Loss) between the fourth quarter of 2015 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2016 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy & Transportation other operating (income) expenses.

Operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $1.262 billion, compared with a loss of $175 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an unfavorable change of $1.087 billion. The most significant items were the unfavorable impact from mark-to-market losses related to pension and OPEB plans and a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries. Excluding these items, operating profit improved $279 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The improvement was mostly due to lower period costs, a decrease in restructuring costs and favorable variable manufacturing costs, partially offset by lower sales volume. The unfavorable price realization resulted from competitive market conditions, primarily in Resource Industries.

Period costs were lower primarily due to substantial restructuring and cost reduction actions over the past year. The reductions impacted period manufacturing costs, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses about equally. Variable manufacturing costs were favorable mostly due to the impact of cost absorption as inventory decreased more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Restructuring costs of $395 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 were related to restructuring programs across the company. In the fourth quarter of 2015, restructuring costs were $679 million, primarily related to a reduction in workforce.

Other Profit/Loss Items 

▪Other income/expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 was income of $34 million, compared with income of $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The unfavorable change was primarily due to lower gains from the sales of securities in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, and the impact from currency translation and hedging gains and losses. The unfavorable change in currency translation and hedging gains and losses was due to higher net losses in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.

▪The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter reflects an annual effective tax rate of approximately 36 percent, compared to 25.5 percent for the full-year 2015, excluding the items discussed below. The effective tax rate related to full-year adjusted profit before tax is 26 percent.

The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2016 also includes a $170 million charge related to the change from the third-quarter estimated annual tax rate. This change was primarily due to the negative impact from the portion of the goodwill impairment not deductible for tax purposes offsetting benefits related to the majority of pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses taxed at higher U.S. rates. In addition, the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets was increased due to recent losses incurred in the United States resulting in a $141 million non-cash charge. The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2015 also included a benefit of $92 million related to the decrease from the third-quarter estimated annual tax rate. This benefit was primarily due to the renewal in the fourth quarter of the U.S. research and development tax credit for 2015. 

Global Workforce

Caterpillar worldwide, full-time employment was about 95,400 at the end of 2016, compared with about 105,700 at the end of 2015, a decrease of about 10,300 full-time employees. The flexible workforce decreased by about 2,000 for a total decrease in the global workforce of about 12,300. The decrease was primarily the result of restructuring programs and lower production volumes.

CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 1 Does not include inter-segment sales of $31 million and $43 million in fourth quarter 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Construction Industries’ sales were $3.589 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of $316 million, or 8 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease was mostly due to lower volume. Sales declined for new equipment and were about flat for aftermarket parts.

▪Sales volume declined primarily due to lower end-user demand, partially offset by a smaller decline in dealer inventories in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015.

Sales decreased in EAME, North America and Latin America and increased in Asia/Pacific.

▪Sales in EAME decreased primarily due to lower end-user demand. The sales decline was primarily in oil-producing economies in Africa/Middle East due to continued low oil prices and an uncertain investment environment.

▪In North America, the sales decline was primarily due to lower end-user demand. Although residential and non-residential building construction activity improved, we believe demand for new construction equipment has remained low due to end users’ utilization of existing used equipment. 

▪In Latin America, sales decreased slightly as lower end-user demand, attributable to weak economic conditions across the region, was partially offset by favorable changes in dealer inventories. Dealers reduced inventories more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2015 than in the fourth quarter of 2016.

▪Sales in Asia/Pacific were higher as a result of an increase in end-user demand primarily in China stemming from increased government support in infrastructure and residential investment. In addition, changes in Asia/Pacific dealer inventories were favorable as dealers increased inventories in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with a decrease in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Construction Industries’ profit was $334 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with $178 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in profit was primarily due to lower period costs and the absence of an unfavorable impact

from litigation in the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by lower sales volume, which includes a favorable mix of products. The lower period costs were mostly a result of the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions.

RESOURCE INDUSTRIES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 1 Does not include inter-segment sales of $87 million and $82 million in fourth quarter 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Resource Industries’ sales were $1.443 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of $435 million, or 23 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of price realization resulting from competitive market conditions. Sales of new equipment decreased while sales of aftermarket parts increased slightly. Aftermarket parts sales have increased sequentially in each of the last three quarters.

The sales decrease was primarily due to lower end-user demand across all regions. While most commodity prices improved in the fourth quarter over a year earlier, current prices have not been sufficient to drive much increase in short-term demand for new equipment. We believe commodity prices now need to stabilize for a longer period of time to positively impact our sales. Mining customers continued to focus on improving productivity in existing mines and reducing their total capital expenditures, as they have for several years. In addition, sales of heavy construction equipment are lower, primarily in North America.

Resource Industries incurred a loss of $711 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with a loss of $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The most significant item impacting the fourth quarter of 2016 was a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million related to the Surface Mining & Technology reporting unit, discussed in Q&A #1 on page 16. Excluding the impairment charge, the fourth quarter of 2016 operating loss was unfavorable $36 million, compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The unfavorable change was due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization, mostly offset by the favorable impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions.

ENERGY & TRANSPORTATION

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 1 Does not include inter-segment sales of $621 million and $615 million in fourth quarter 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Energy & Transportation’s sales were $3.849 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of $695 million, or 15 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volume. 

▪Transportation - Sales decreased in North America, Asia/Pacific and EAME primarily due to continued weakness in the rail industry, with the most significant decline in North America. The North American rail industry continues to be depressed with a significant number of idle locomotives that impacted demand for rail services and aftermarket. The decline in Asia/Pacific was mostly due to lower demand for equipment used in marine applications, primarily for work boats. Sales in Latin America were about flat.

▪Oil and Gas - Sales decreased in much of the world due to the impact from low oil prices. The sales decline was primarily related to lower demand across all regions for equipment used for production, partially offset by increased demand for turbines used for gas compression.

▪Power Generation - Sales decreased in EAME and were about flat in all other regions. The decline in EAME was primarily a result of continued weakness in the Middle East with continued low oil prices limiting investments.

▪Industrial - Sales were about flat as an increase in Asia/Pacific was mostly offset by a decrease in EAME, both attributable to changes in end-user demand for most industrial applications. 

Energy & Transportation’s profit was $638 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with $741 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume, partially offset by the impact of restructuring and cost reduction actions and a favorable impact of cost absorption as inventory decreased more significantly in the fourth quarter of 2015 than the fourth quarter of 2016.

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS SEGMENT

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Financial Products’ revenues were $742 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of $4 million, or 1 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline was primarily due to lower average earning assets in North America and Latin America, an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment primarily in North America and lower average financing rates in Latin America. These decreases were partially offset by higher average financing rates in North America.

Financial Products’ profit was $149 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with $191 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower gains on sales of securities at Insurance Services and an unfavorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment.

At the end of 2016, past dues at Cat Financial were 2.38 percent, compared with 2.14 percent at the end of 2015. The increase in past dues was primarily driven by the European marine portfolio. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $123 million for the full-year 2016, compared with $155 million for the full-year 2015.

As of December 31, 2016, Cat Financial’s allowance for credit losses totaled $343 million, or 1.29 percent of net finance receivables, compared with $338 million, or 1.22 percent of net finance receivables at year-end 2015.

Corporate Items and Eliminations

Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $1.581 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $478 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. Corporate items and eliminations include: corporate-level expenses; restructuring costs; timing differences, as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis; retirement benefit costs other than service cost; currency differences for ME&T, as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates; cost of sales methodology differences as segments use a current cost methodology; and inter-segment eliminations. 

The increase was due to the unfavorable impact of higher mark-to-market losses related to our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market losses in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $985 million, compared to mark-to-market losses of $214 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This was partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs of $284 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.

2017 OUTLOOK

Positives

We are seeing positive signs that could be early indications of modest recovery in several of our businesses. 

Resource Industries - Commodity prices at higher levels than a year ago, along with sequential improvements in parts sales in each of the last three quarters and improvements in quoting and order activity in the fourth quarter, suggest that mining-related sales may have bottomed. 

Construction Industries - Sales in China began recovering in 2016; sales in Europe seem to have stabilized and could improve some in 2017; and sales in Brazil, which are off their peak by over 80 percent, could improve if the Brazilian economy begins to recover from recession. 

Energy & Transportation - Gas compression remains strong, and we have a solid backlog for turbines. If oil prices rise modestly and stabilize, it would be positive for our businesses that support drilling and well servicing. 

Prospects for tax reform and an infrastructure spending bill in the United States are encouraging. While these initiatives would likely be a solid positive for many of our businesses, we would not expect to begin to see meaningful effects of these changes until sometime in 2018.

Concerns

Resource Industries - While quoting interest in mining products has improved, we are expecting miners’ capital spending to be about flat in 2017 after several years of decline. Sales of some large construction equipment within Resource Industries are likely to be down in 2017, compared with 2016.

Construction Industries - North America and EAME are the most concerning regions. While better economic growth and increased infrastructure spending may be on the horizon, the availability of used equipment has negatively impacted sales in North America during 2016 and we expect some negative impact in 2017. We expect sales in Africa/Middle East to be down again in 2017 due to overall economic weakness and continued pressure on economies that rely on oil revenues to drive economic growth. In addition, continuing uncertainty related to Brexit remains a concern in Europe.

Energy & Transportation - Rail remains challenged with low traffic volume and a significant number of idle locomotives. Additionally, weakness in shipbuilding is expected to be negative for our marine-related sales; power generation sales are projected to remain weak; and industrial engine sales to original equipment manufacturers are expected to be lower than 2016. 

2017 Outlook - Sales and Revenues and Profit

Our expectations for 2017 are similar to those shared with investors in early December 2016. At that time, we believed the analyst consensus for 2017 sales and revenues of about $38 billion was a reasonable midpoint expectation. Our expectations for sales and revenues in 2017 are now slightly lower due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past two months, and as a result, our current outlook for sales and revenues in 2017 is a range of $36 billion to $39 billion with a midpoint of $37.5 billion.

We expect profit per share of about $2.30 at the midpoint of the sales and revenues outlook range. Excluding restructuring costs of about $500 million, we expect adjusted profit of about $2.90 per share at the midpoint, which reflects decremental operating profit pull through of about 30 percent from 2016. 

Our 2016 results included several significant items: restructuring costs, mark-to-market losses for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans, a goodwill impairment charge and a deferred tax valuation allowance. In 2017, we expect to incur about $500 million of restructuring costs primarily related to ongoing manufacturing facility consolidations to lower our cost structure in response to weak economic conditions. No estimate of potential restructuring costs for contemplated actions at Gosselies, Belgium, or Aurora, Illinois, has been included in our outlook. At this time, our outlook does not include a mark-to-

market gain or loss for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans. Our outlook does not include a goodwill impairment charge or significant changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances in 2017.

The following factors are expected to contribute to an anticipated decline in profit in 2017:

•An expected decline in sales volume is anticipated to have a negative impact on profit, including the effect of an unfavorable sales mix as the decline is expected to be more concentrated in products with higher than average margin rates.

•Short-term employee incentive compensation and labor cost inflation are expected to be unfavorable by about $600 million. 

•Financial Products segment profit is expected to be lower in 2017 in part due to gains on the sale of securities at Insurance Services in 2016 that we are not expecting to repeat in 2017. 

•The tax rate is expected to be about 27 percent in 2017.

The following factors are expected to partially offset an anticipated decline in profit in 2017:

•The primary positive is the continuation of substantial cost reduction in 2017. Not including short-term incentive compensation and labor inflation noted above, Caterpillar is expecting about $750 million of additional cost reduction in 2017.

◦About two-thirds is expected to be from lower period costs and is a result of restructuring actions taken in recent years and the company’s continued focus on cost management.

◦About one-third is expected from variable costs. A reduction in material costs is the most significant factor. While we do not expect material cost reduction from commodity prices, we expect continued improvement in material costs from supplier collaboration, sourcing and design-related improvements.

•In 2016, price realization was a substantial negative. While the pricing environment remains very competitive, we believe price realization has begun to level off. We expect price realization to be neutral to slightly positive in 2017.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q1:Can you provide more information on the four significant items impacting 2016 profit?

A:In order for our results to be more meaningful to our readers, we have separately quantified the impact of several significant items.

•Mark-to-Market Losses - Effective January 1, 2016, we made a change in accounting principle related to our pension and OPEB plans. Under the new accounting principle, we recognize actuarial gains and losses as a mark-to-market gain or loss when incurred rather than amortizing them to earnings over time. For 2016, the mark-to-market adjustment was a net loss of $985 million, primarily due to lower interest rates. Accounting rules require us to remeasure our future benefit payments using an interest rate as of each year-end. If interest rates drop, the present value of future benefit payments increases resulting in a mark-to-market loss. If interest rates increase, the present value of the future benefit payments decreases resulting in a mark-to-market gain. Differences in actual versus expected investment performance of plan assets and changes in other economic and demographic factors also impact the adjustment. We believe profit excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains or losses better reflects earnings from ongoing business performance because this adjustment has no impact on current year cash flow or on benefits paid to plan participants. 

•Goodwill Impairment Charge - Step 1 of the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of October 1, 2016, indicated that the fair value of the Surface Mining & Technology reporting unit, included in Resource Industries, was lower than its carrying value. We completed step 2 of the impairment testing process during the fourth quarter of 2016 and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $595 million. The mining industry has experienced weakness for several years and, while we continue to expect the industry to improve, we believe the pace of the improvement will be slower and cash flows and profitability will be lower than previously forecasted. After the impairment charge, goodwill of approximately $600 million remains in Surface Mining & Technology.

•State Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance - Based on recent losses incurred in the United States, we recorded a non-cash charge of $141 million to increase the valuation allowance against the related state net deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of 2016. If profitability improves in future periods, the valuation allowance can be reversed.

•Restructuring Costs - For the past several years, we have incurred substantial restructuring costs as a result of actions to lower our cost structure in response to weak economic conditions in the key industries we serve. During 2016, we incurred $1.019 billion of restructuring costs primarily related to Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation. 

To help improve the understanding of results for the quarter and the year, the following tables show the impact of these items:

Q2:Can you comment on your 2017 outlook for restructuring costs? Does it include impacts from contemplated actions at Caterpillar manufacturing facilities in Gosselies, Belgium, and Aurora, Illinois? 

A: In 2017, we expect to incur about $500 million of restructuring costs primarily related to ongoing manufacturing facility consolidations to lower our cost structure in response to weak economic conditions. Most of the actions have been announced and are being implemented.

On September 24, 2015, Caterpillar announced a significant restructuring and cost reduction initiative, with actions expected through 2018. The largest action among those included in the initiative was related to our European manufacturing footprint. On September 2, 2016, Caterpillar announced that it is contemplating to allocate the volumes produced at the Gosselies, Belgium, facility to other manufacturing facilities. If the intention is confirmed, it would result in a collective layoff of about 2,000 employees and the closure of the Gosselies site. We are currently engaged in the information and consultation process with Gosselies employee representatives. 

Additionally, on January 4, 2017, Caterpillar announced that it is contemplating the potential closure of the Aurora, Illinois, manufacturing facility. If this plan is confirmed, Caterpillar would move machine production from the Aurora facility to other U.S. manufacturing facilities.

No estimate of potential restructuring costs for Gosselies or Aurora has been included in our outlook for 2017 restructuring costs as the outcome of these contemplated actions is not yet known and no decisions have been made.

Q3:Can you discuss changes in dealer inventories during 2016 and expectations for 2017? 

A: Dealer machine and engine inventories decreased about $800 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with a decrease of about $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year of 2016, dealer machine and engine inventories decreased about $1.6 billion, compared with a decrease of about $1.0 billion for the full year of 2015.

The level of dealer inventories at the end of 2017 will depend on dealer expectations for business in 2018. Our outlook range reflects an expectation that dealers will not reduce inventories in 2017 as much as they did in 2016.

Q4:Can you discuss the decline in Caterpillar inventory in the fourth quarter of 2016? 

A: Caterpillar inventory declined about $900 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. A fourth-quarter decrease is not unusual, as some of our businesses ship long lead-time capital goods in the fourth quarter. For the full year of 2016, Caterpillar inventory declined about $1.1 billion.

Q5:Can you discuss changes to your order backlog by segment? 

A:At the end of 2016, the order backlog was about $12.1 billion. This represents about a $500 million increase from the end of the third quarter of 2016. The increase was in both Construction Industries and Resource Industries, more significantly in Construction Industries. A decline in Energy & Transportation partially offset the increase.

Compared with year-end 2015, the order backlog declined about $900 million. The decrease was in Energy & Transportation and Construction Industries, partially offset by an increase in Resource Industries. 

Q6:Can you comment on expense related to your 2016 short-term incentive compensation plans? What are plans for 2017? 

A:Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance measured against targets set annually. Fourth-quarter 2016 expense was about $50 million and full-year 2016 expense was about $250 million. Fourth-quarter 2015 expense was about $45 million and full-year 2015 expense was about $585 million.

For 2017, our outlook includes short-term incentive compensation of about $750 million.

Q7: Can you give us an update on how Cat Financial is performing?

A:Cat Financial's portfolio continues to perform well overall despite ongoing weakness in many key end markets. Fourth-quarter 2016 past dues were 2.38 percent, compared with 2.14 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, with current past dues remaining lower than historical averages. Write-offs in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $30 million, or 0.45 percent of the average retail portfolio, compared with $36 million, or 0.55 percent of the average retail portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2015, and slightly below historical averages for the fourth quarter.

Q8:Can you comment on your balance sheet and cash priorities? 

A: The ME&T debt-to-capital ratio was 41.0 percent at the end of 2016, compared with 39.0 percent at the end of 2015. Our cash and liquidity positions remain strong with an enterprise cash balance of $7.168 billion as of year-end 2016. ME&T operating cash flow for the full year of 2016 was $3.857 billion, compared with $5.175 billion in 2015. The decline was primarily due to impacts from lower profit. During the year, ME&T capital expenditures totaled $1.206 billion, and funding for defined benefit pension plans was about $150 million. 

Although our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate, our long-term cash deployment strategy remains unchanged: to maintain a strong financial position in support of our credit rating, provide capital to support growth, appropriately fund employee benefit plans, pay dividends and repurchase common stock.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The following definitions are provided for “non-GAAP financial measures” in connection with Regulation G issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or substituted for the related GAAP measure. 

Adjusted Profit

We believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of several special items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers. These items consist of (i) restructuring costs, which are incurred in the current year to generate longer term benefits, (ii) pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses resulting from plan remeasurements, (iii) goodwill impairment charges and (iv) state deferred tax valuation allowances. We do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the non-GAAP measure will provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends, and a means to assess our period-over-period results.

Reconciliations of adjusted profit before taxes to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, consolidated profit before taxes, are as follows:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Reconciliations of adjusted profit per share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, diluted profit per share, are as follows:
