QUANTA SERVICES REPORTS 2016 FOURTH QUARTER AND ANNUAL RESULTS  

Record Fourth Quarter Revenues of $2.10 Billion  

Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Stock of $0.57  

Income Tax Benefits, Net of Other Charges, Favorably Impact Quarter by $0.06  

Record Twelve-Month Backlog  

Record Oil & Gas Infrastructure Services Full Year Revenues  

HOUSTON – Feb. 21, 2017 - Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR) today announced results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $2.10 billion, compared to revenues of $1.90 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015, and net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $88.5 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to net loss from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $2.6 million, or a loss of $0.02 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2015. As described further below, certain items favorably impacted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2016 by $0.06 per share.   

“We are pleased with the revenue and profitability momentum we experienced in the second half of 2016, as evidenced by our record revenues in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that this momentum will continue into 2017 and believe we are well positioned for profitable growth,” said Duke Austin, president and chief executive officer of Quanta Services. “We see multi-year growth opportunities for both electric power and oil and gas infrastructure services, and we remain focused on our strategic objectives of returning profitability to historical levels, safely providing infrastructure solutions to our customers and running the business for the long-term.”  

Items affecting the quarter and reflected as adjustments in Quanta’s adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation were tax benefits of $20.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, associated with the release of tax contingencies upon expiration of certain statute of limitations periods. These benefits were partially offset by approximately $8.0 million ($7.1 million net of tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, of asset impairment charges primarily due to a pending disposition of certain international renewable energy services operations. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) was $0.56 for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $0.30 for the fourth quarter of 2015.

Also negatively impacting the fourth quarter of 2016 were litigation costs incurred of approximately $6.0 million ($3.6 million net of tax), or $0.02 per diluted share, resulting from Quanta’s defense of allegations that it violated the non-compete agreement entered into in connection with the disposition of certain telecommunication construction operations in December 2012.  

RECENT HIGHLIGHTS  

   •   Fort McMurray West 500 kV Transmission Project Obtains Key Approval - In February 2017, the Alberta Utilities Commission approved Alberta Powerline General Partner Ltd.’s (Alberta Powerline) application to construct and operate the Fort McMurray West 500 kV Transmission Project. As announced in December 2014, Alberta Powerline is a limited partnership formed by Quanta Services and ATCO Group for this project. Pending completion of a few additional steps, full construction is expected to begin in the second half of 2017 and completion is expected in 2019. This project was the largest project ever awarded to Quanta and has been reflected in backlog since 2015.  

RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015  

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $7.65 billion compared to revenues of $7.57 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $198.7 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $120.3 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Included in Quanta’s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016 were losses of approximately $54.8 million ($33.4 million net of tax), or $0.21 per diluted share, on a power plant construction project in Alaska that resulted from engineering and production issues. Included in Quanta’s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 were losses of approximately $44.9 million ($27.4 million net of tax), or $0.14 per diluted share, related to the same project.  

Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) was $1.51 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $1.11 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The adjusted diluted earnings per share measures used in this earnings release are calculated as GAAP diluted earnings per share before acquisition and integration costs, amortization of intangible assets, non-cash compensation expense, and certain other items that affect comparability of results between periods. See the attached table for a reconciliation of adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock to GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Quanta completed five acquisitions during 2016. Therefore, Quanta’s results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 included these acquisitions from the respective acquisition dates and are compared to the pre-acquisition historical results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015.  

OUTLOOK  

The long-term outlook for Quanta’s business is positive. However, weather, regulatory, permitting, project timing, execution challenges and other factors have impacted the company’s historical results, and may impact Quanta’s future financial results. Therefore, Quanta’s financial outlook for revenues, margins and earnings reflects management’s effort to properly align these uncertainties with the backlog that the company is executing on and the opportunities that are expected to materialize during 2017. The following forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially.  

Quanta expects revenues for the full year 2017 to range between $7.9 billion and $8.5 billion and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock to be $1.52 to $1.77. Quanta expects adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) for the full year 2017 to be $1.80 to $2.05. See the attached table for a reconciliation of estimated adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock to estimated GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the full year 2017.  

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The non-GAAP measures in this press release and on Quanta’s website are provided to enable investors, analysts and management to evaluate Quanta’s performance excluding the effects of certain items that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between reporting periods. In addition, management believes these measures are useful in comparing Quanta’s operating results with those of its competitors. These measures should be used in addition to, and not in lieu of, results prepared in conformity with GAAP. Reconciliations of other non-GAAP to GAAP measures not included in the tables attached to this press release can be found on the company’s website at www.quantaservices.com in the “Investors & Media” section.

Segment Results  

Quanta reports its results under two reportable segments: (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services and (2) Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services, as set forth below (in thousands, except percentages).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Included in operating income for the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $54.8 million of losses related to a power plant construction project in Alaska. Included in operating income for the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were $19.3 million and $44.9 million of losses related to the same power plant construction project.  

 (b) Included in operating income for the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was a $5.7 million asset impairment charge primarily due to a pending disposition of certain international renewable energy services operations. Included in operating income for the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was the impact of a $6.6 million property and equipment impairment charge related to the same international renewable energy services operations.

Backlog  

Backlog is not a term recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); however, it is a common measurement used in the industry. Quanta’s methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies. Quanta’s backlog represents the amount of consolidated revenue that it expects to realize from future work under construction contracts, long-term maintenance contracts and master service agreements. These estimates include revenues from the remaining portion of firm orders not yet completed and on which work has not yet begun, as well as revenues from change orders, renewal options, and funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent that they are reasonably expected to occur. For purposes of calculating backlog, Quanta includes 100% of estimated revenues attributable to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities. The following table presents Quanta’s total backlog by reportable segment as of December 31, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, along with an estimate of the backlog amounts expected to be realized within 12 months of each balance sheet date (in millions):

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations  

For the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015  

(In thousands, except per share information)  

(Unaudited)  

The non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock, when used in connection with diluted earnings per share, is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s performance. Management believes that the exclusion of certain items from net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock enables it to more effectively evaluate Quanta’s operations period over period and better identify operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. As to certain of the items below, (i) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta’s acquisition activity, which can cause these amounts to vary from period to period; (ii) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted during the period; (iii) income tax contingency releases vary period to period depending on the level of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the expiration dates under various federal and state tax statute of limitations periods; (iv) acquisition and integration costs vary period to period depending on the level of Quanta’s ongoing acquisition activity; (v) asset impairments can vary from period to period depending on economic and other factors; (vi) severance costs related to the departure of Quanta’s former president and chief executive officer and severance and restructuring costs associated with certain operations primarily within Quanta’s Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment are not regularly occurring items; and (vii) the cumulative revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities associated with an Alberta provincial income tax law change and the elimination of the tax benefits associated with a previously unrecognized deferred tax asset related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are not regularly occurring items. Because adjusted diluted earnings per share, as defined, excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock, adjusted diluted earnings per share as presented in this press release may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included below. Reconciliations of other non-GAAP to GAAP measures not included in the table below can be found on the company’s website at www.quantaservices.com in the “Investors & Media” section.

See notes to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations on the following page.  

 (a) The amounts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 reflect the elimination of impairment charges primarily related to the pending disposition of certain international renewable energy services operations. The amounts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 reflect the elimination of asset impairment charges primarily associated with goodwill and intangible asset reductions, which resulted from lower levels of expected activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and, to a lesser extent, with respect to certain directional drilling operations in Australia due to the extended low commodity price environment, and the elimination of a property and equipment impairment charge related to the same international renewable energy services operations.  

 (b) The amount for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 reflects the elimination of severance costs associated with the departure of Quanta’s former president and chief executive officer and severance and restructuring costs associated with certain operations primarily within the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment.  

 (c) The amounts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 reflect the elimination of tax benefits primarily associated with the expiration of various federal and state tax statute of limitations periods during the fourth quarter of 2016. Significant uncertainty surrounds the timing of the release and the amount of such benefits.  

 (d) The amounts for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 reflect the realization of a previously unrecognized deferred tax asset related to Quanta’s investment in a foreign subsidiary.  

 (e) The amount for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 reflects the elimination of the non-recurring impact of the cumulative revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities pursuant to an Alberta provincial income tax law change that became effective as of June 1, 2015.  

 (f) The income tax impact of adjustments that are subject to tax is determined using the incremental statutory tax rate of the jurisdictions to which each adjustment relates for the respective periods.
