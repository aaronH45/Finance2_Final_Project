Edison International Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Results; 

Introduces 2017 Earnings Guidance

ROSEMEAD, Calif., February 21, 2017 - Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported fourth quarter 2016 net income of $345 million, or $1.06 per share, compared to a net loss of $79 million, or $0.24 loss per share, in the fourth quarter 2015. As adjusted, fourth quarter 2016 core earnings were $332 million, or $1.02 per share, compared to core earnings of $287 million, or $0.88 per share, in the fourth quarter 2015.

Southern California Edison's (SCE) fourth quarter 2016 net income increased by $419 million, or $1.29 per share, from the fourth quarter 2015. SCE's increase in net income consisted of $49 million of higher core earnings and $370 million of higher non-core earnings. The increase in core earnings was due to an increase in revenue from the escalation mechanism as set forth in the 2015 General Rate Case (GRC) and lower operations and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher net financing costs and tax expense. There were no SCE non-core items in the fourth quarter 2016 results. Fourth quarter 2015 SCE core earnings excluded losses of $370 million, or $1.14 per share. This is primarily related to the $382 million, or $1.18 per share, write-down of SCE deferred income tax regulatory asset from certain 2012-2014 tax repair deductions. 

Fourth quarter 2016 losses from continuing operations at Edison International Parent and Other increased by $16 million, or $0.05 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2015. This increase consisted of $4 million of higher core losses and $12 million of non-core income related to the fourth quarter 2015. The higher core losses reflected lower revenue from Edison Capital's affordable housing investment portfolio, partially offset by lower corporate expenses. There were no non-core items in the fourth quarter 2016 for Edison International Parent and Other. Fourth quarter 2015 non-core items included income of $10 million, or $0.03 per share, related to the completion of the sale of Edison Capital's affordable housing investment portfolio and $2 million, or $0.01 per share, of income under the hypothetical liquidation at book value (HLBV) accounting method. Additionally, Edison International recorded $13 million of income, or $0.04 per share, and losses of $8 million, or $0.02 per share, from discontinued operations for the fourth quarter 2016 and fourth quarter 2015, respectively.

“Edison International delivered excellent fourth quarter and full-year results at the high end of our guidance range, led by SCE’s strong operating performance,” said Pedro Pizarro, Edison International president and chief executive officer. “Additionally, we have introduced 2017 earnings guidance with the midpoint above consensus analyst estimates.”

Full Year Earnings

For 2016, Edison International reported net income of $1,311 million, or $4.02 per share, compared to $1,020 million, or $3.13 per share, in 2015. On an adjusted basis, Edison International’s core earnings were $1,294 million, or $3.97 per share, compared to $1,336 million, or $4.10 per share, in 2015.

SCE’s 2016 net income increased $378 million, or $1.16 per share, from 2015. SCE's increased net income consisted of $8 million, or $0.02 per share, of higher core earnings and $370 million, or $1.14 per share, of higher non-core earnings. The increase in core earnings was due to an increase in revenue from the escalation mechanism as set forth in the 2015 GRC and lower operations and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher net financing costs and tax expense. There were no non-core items in 2016 SCE results. 2015 SCE core earnings excluded losses of $370 million, or $1.14 per share. This loss primarily related to the $382 million, or $1.18 per share, write-down of SCE deferred income tax regulatory asset from certain 2012-2014 tax repair deductions. 

Edison International Parent and Other losses from continuing operations for 2016 increased by $64 million, or $0.19 per share, compared to 2015. This increase consisted of $50 million, or $0.15 per share, of higher core losses and $14 million, or $0.04 per share, of higher non-core losses. During the second quarter 2016, Edison International Parent and Other recorded an after-tax charge of $13 million, or $0.04 per share, related to the buy-out of an earn-out provision with the former shareholders of a company acquired by Edison Energy at the end of 2015. In addition, higher core losses reflected higher Edison Energy Group operating and development costs and lower results at SoCore Energy. Results during 2015 included income from Edison Capital's investments in affordable housing projects, which were sold at the end of 2015. 

Edison International Parent and Other's non-core items for 2016 included income of $5 million, or $0.02 per share, compared to income of $9 million, or $0.03 per share, for 2015 related to losses under the HLBV accounting method. During 2015, Edison International Parent and Other recorded non-core income of $10 million, or $0.03 per share, related to the completion of the sale of Edison Capital's affordable housing investment portfolio. Additionally, Edison International recorded income of $12 million, or $0.03 per share, and $35 million, or $0.11 per share, from discontinued operations for 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Edison International uses core earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts for significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. Edison International management believes that core earnings provide more meaningful comparisons of performance from period to period. Please see the attached tables for a reconciliation of core earnings to basic GAAP earnings.

2017 Earnings Guidance

The company announced basic and core earnings guidance of $4.04 to $4.24 per share for 2017. See the presentation accompanying the company’s conference call for further information including key guidance assumptions.

Appendix

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Edison International’s earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company’s earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and core earnings per share (EPS) internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance of Edison International and Southern California Edison. We also use core earnings and core EPS when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company’s performance from period to period. Financial measures referred to as net income, basic EPS, core earnings, or core EPS also apply to the description of earnings or earnings per share.

Core earnings and core EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core EPS are defined as basic earnings and basic EPS excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. Basic earnings and losses refer to net income or losses attributable to Edison International shareholders. Core earnings are reconciled to basic earnings in the attached tables. The impact of participating securities (vested awards that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for the principal operating subsidiary is not material to the principal operating subsidiary’s EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which is included in Edison International Parent and Other.

•risks inherent in the construction of SCE’s transmission and distribution infrastructure investment program, including those related to project site identification, public opposition, environmental mitigation, construction, permitting, power curtailment costs (payments due under power contracts in the event there is insufficient transmission to enable acceptance of power delivery), and governmental approvals; 

•ability to obtain sufficient insurance, including insurance relating to SCE's nuclear facilities and wildfire-related liability, and to recover the costs of such insurance or in the absence of insurance the ability to recover uninsured losses; and
