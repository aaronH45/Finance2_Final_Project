Non‐GAAP reconciliation: Non‐interest income, non‐interest expense and efficiency ratio NM ‐ Not Meaningful The table below presents computations of the efficiency ratio (non‐GAAP), which is a measure of productivity, generally calculated as non‐interest expense divided by total revenue. Management uses this ratio to monitor performance and believes this measure provides meaningful information to investors. Non‐interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non‐interest expense (non‐GAAP), which is the numerator for the efficiency ratio. Non‐interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non‐interest income (non‐GAAP), which is the numerator for the fee income ratio. Net interest income and other financing income on a taxable‐equivalent basis and non‐interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable‐equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable‐equivalent basis (non‐GAAP), which is the denominator for the efficiency ratio. Regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful base for period‐to‐period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non‐ GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions’ business. It is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur; however, management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. The table on the following page presents a computation of the operating leverage ratio (non‐GAAP) which is the period to period percentage change in adjusted total revenue on a taxable‐equivalent basis (non‐GAAP) less the percentage change in adjusted non‐interest expense (non‐GAAP).

Non‐GAAP reconciliation continued: YTD return on average tangible stockholders' equity and earnings per common share from continuing operations 27 The tables below present computations of "adjusted net income from continuing operations available to common shareholders," "adjusted return on average tangible common stockholders' equity" and "adjusted earnings per common share from continuing operations," which exclude certain significant items that are included in the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these measures provide a meaningful base for period‐to‐period comparisons, and will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non‐GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions’ business. It is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur; however, management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non‐GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. These non‐GAAP measures also provide analysts and investors certain metrics regarding the progress of the Company in comparison to long‐term expected results previously communicated. (1) The total net adjustments to non‐interest expense is the summation of the adjustments previously shown on page 26. (2) The total net adjustments to non‐interest income is the summation of the adjustments previously shown on page 26. (3) The computation of the income tax impact for adjusted items is based on 38.5%, comprised of the statutory federal rate of 35%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit. The tax adjustment also includes the tax impact from leveraged lease termination gains.

The table below presents computations of the adjusted allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale ratio (non-GAAP), generally calculated as adjusted allowance for loan losses divided by adjusted total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale. The allowance for loan losses (GAAP) is presented excluding the portion of the allowance related to direct energy loans to arrive at the adjusted allowance for loan losses (non-GAAP). Total non-accrual loans (GAAP) is presented excluding direct energy non-accrual loans to arrive at adjusted total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the allowance for loan losses to non-accrual loans ratio. Management believes that excluding the portion of the allowance for loan losses related to direct energy loans and the direct energy non-accrual loans will assist investors in analyzing the Company's credit quality performance absent the volatility that has been experienced by energy businesses. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, are not audited, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.

Non‐GAAP reconciliation: Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio – fully phased‐in pro‐forma (1) Current quarter amounts and the resulting ratio are estimated. (2) Regions continues to develop systems and internal controls to precisely calculate risk‐weighted assets as required by Basel III on a fully phased‐in basis. The amount included above is a reasonable approximation, based on our understanding of the requirements. The calculation of the fully phased‐in pro‐forma "Common equity Tier 1" (CET1) is based on Regions’ understanding of the Final Basel III requirements. For Regions, the Basel III framework became effective on a phased‐in approach starting in 2015 with full implementation beginning in 2019. The calculation provided below includes estimated pro‐forma amounts for the ratio on a fully phased‐in basis. Regions’ current understanding of the final framework includes certain assumptions, including the Company’s interpretation of the requirements, and informal feedback received through the regulatory process. Regions’ understanding of the framework is evolving and will likely change as analysis and discussions with regulators continue. Because Regions is not currently subject to the fully‐phased in capital rules, this pro‐forma measure is considered to be a non‐GAAP financial measure, and other entities may calculate it differently from Regions’ disclosed calculation. A company's regulatory capital is often expressed as a percentage of risk‐weighted assets. Under the risk‐based capital framework, a company’s balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off‐balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories. The aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the prescribed risk‐weighted percentage. The resulting weighted values from each of the categories are added together and this sum is the risk‐weighted assets total that, as adjusted, comprises the denominator of certain risk‐based capital ratios. Common equity Tier 1 capital is then divided by this denominator (risk‐weighted assets) to determine the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. The amounts disclosed as risk‐weighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements on a fully phased‐in basis. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions’ capital adequacy using the fully phased‐in Basel III framework, we believe that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions’ capital adequacy on this same basis.

Forward‐looking statements This release may include forward‐looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which reflect Regions’ current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward‐looking statements are not based on historical information, but rather are related to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Forward‐looking statements are based on management’s expectations as well as certain assumptions and estimates made by, and information available to, management at the time the statements are made. Those statements are based on general assumptions and are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the views, beliefs and projections expressed in such statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, those described below: • Current and future economic and market conditions in the United States generally or in the communities we serve, including the effects of declines in property values, unemployment rates and potential reductions of economic growth, which may adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and conditions. • Possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar organizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. • The effects of a possible downgrade in the U.S. government’s sovereign credit rating or outlook, which could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict. • Possible changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity. • Any impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles, or any adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets due to adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations of the reporting unit, or other factors. •Possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and the possible impairment of the collectability of loans. • Changes in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes, charge‐offs, loan loss provisions or actual loan losses where our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses. • Possible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage‐backed securities due to low interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization on those securities. • Our ability to effectively compete with other financial services companies, some of whom possess greater financial resources than we do and are subject to different regulatory standards than we are. • Loss of customer checking and savings account deposits as customers pursue other, higher‐yield investments, which could increase our funding costs. • Our inability to develop and gain acceptance from current and prospective customers for new products and services in a timely manner could have a negative impact on our revenue. • The effects of any developments, changes or actions relating to any litigation or regulatory proceedings brought against us or any of our subsidiaries. • Changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, such as the Dodd‐Frank Act and other legislation and regulations relating to bank products and services, as well as changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations by applicable governmental and self‐regulatory agencies, which could require us to change certain business practices, increase compliance risk, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses. • Our ability to obtain a regulatory non‐objection (as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) to take certain capital actions, including paying dividends and any plans to increase common stock dividends, repurchase common stock under current or future programs, or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments, may impact our ability to return capital to stockholders and market perceptions of us. • Our ability to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements (as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) may continue to require a significant investment of our managerial resources due to the importance and intensity of such tests and requirements. • Our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements (including, among other things, the Basel III capital standards and the LCR rule), including our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms, and if we fail to meet requirements, our financial condition could be negatively impacted. • The Basel III framework calls for additional risk‐based capital surcharges for globally systemically important banks. Although we are not subject to such surcharges, it is possible that in the future we may become subject to similar surcharges. • The costs, including possibly incurring fines, penalties, or other negative effects (including reputational harm) of any adverse judicial, administrative, or arbitral rulings or proceedings, regulatory enforcement actions, or other legal actions to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party, and which may adversely affect our results. • Our ability to manage fluctuations in the value of assets and liabilities and off‐balance sheet exposure so as to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity to support our business. • Our ability to execute on our strategic and operational plans, including our ability to fully realize the financial and non‐financial benefits relating to our strategic initiatives. • The success of our marketing efforts in attracting and retaining customers. • Possible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits and the related effect on our ability to increase assets and to attract deposits, which could adversely affect our net income. • Our ability to recruit and retain talented and experienced personnel to assist in the development, management and operation of our products and services may be affected by changes in laws and regulations in effect from time to time. • Fraud or misconduct by our customers, employees or business partners. 30
