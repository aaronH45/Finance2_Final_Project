February 22, 2017 Business Update February 2017 Exhibit 99.1  

February 22, 2017 1 Statements contained in this presentation about future performance, including, without limitation, operating results, capital expenditures, rate base growth, dividend policy, financial outlook, and other statements that are not purely historical, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations; however, such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of the date of this presentation, and Edison International assumes no duty to update them to reflect new information, events or circumstances. Important factors that could cause different results include, but are not limited to the: • ability of SCE to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates, including costs related to San Onofre and proposed spending on grid modernization; • decisions and other actions by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC and other regulatory authorities, including the determinations of authorized rates of return or return on equity, approval of proposed spending on grid modernization, the outcome of San Onofre CPUC proceedings, and delays in regulatory actions; • risks associated with cost allocation, including the potential movement of costs to certain customers, caused by the ability of cities, counties and certain other public agencies to generate and/or purchase electricity for their local residents and businesses, along with other possible customer bypass or departure due to increased adoption of distributed energy resources or technological advancements in the generation, storage, transmission, distribution and use of electricity, and supported by public policy, government regulations and incentives; • risks inherent in the construction of SCE’s transmission and distribution infrastructure investment program, including those related to project site identification, public opposition, environmental mitigation, construction, permitting, power curtailment costs (payments due under power contracts in the event there is insufficient transmission to enable acceptance of power delivery), and governmental approvals; • ability to obtain sufficient insurance, including insurance relating to SCE's nuclear facilities and wildfire-related liability, and to recover the costs of such insurance or in the absence of insurance the ability to recover uninsured losses; and • risks associated with the decommissioning of San Onofre, including those related to public opposition, permitting, governmental approvals, and cost overruns. Other important factors are discussed under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” in Edison International’s Form 10-K, most recent Form 10-Q, and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on our website: www.edisoninvestor.com. These filings also provide additional information on historical and other factual data contained in this presentation. Forward-Looking Statements

February 22, 2017 46 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States. Management uses core earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings are also used when communicating with investors and analysts regarding Edison International's earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. Core earnings are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings (or losses) are defined as earnings or losses attributable to Edison International shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as: exit activities, including sale of certain assets, and other activities that are no longer continuing; asset impairments and certain tax, regulatory or legal settlements or proceedings.
