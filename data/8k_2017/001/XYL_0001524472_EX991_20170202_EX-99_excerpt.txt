RYE BROOK, N.Y., February 2, 2017 – Xylem Inc. (NYSE: XYL), a leading global water technology company dedicated to solving the world’s most challenging water issues, today reported fourth quarter 2016 net income of $50 million, or $0.28 per share. Excluding the impact of restructuring, realignment, Sensus acquisition-related charges and other special items, the Company delivered adjusted net income of $118 million or $0.66 per share in the quarter, a 10-percent increase over the prior year period. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, which was up 10 percent due to the contribution of the Sensus business, which was acquired on October 31, 2016. Revenue for the quarter declined two percent organically, reflecting ongoing softness in the industrial end market. Reported operating margin in the quarter was 10 percent. Adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points year-over-year to 15.3 percent. This margin expansion was driven by the Company’s ongoing execution of productivity initiatives.  

For the full year 2016, Xylem generated $3.8 billion in revenue, up three percent on a reported basis and one percent organically. Full-year reported net income was $260 million, or $1.45 per share, with an operating margin of 10.8 percent. Adjusted net income, which excludes the impact of restructuring, realignment, Sensus acquisition-related charges and other special items, was $364 million, or $2.03 per share, a 10-percent increase over the prior year. Xylem delivered a full-year 2016 adjusted operating margin of 13.6 percent, up 70 basis points versus the prior year. The Company generated $386 million in free cash flow, an increase of 11 percent versus last year, representing a 120-percent conversion. 

“Xylem closed out a transformative year in 2016 and I’m proud of the solid commercial and financial results our teams delivered,” said Patrick Decker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Xylem.  

 “For the year, we generated organic revenue growth in mixed market conditions, and grew our operating margins and earnings in a meaningful way. While the industrial end market was challenged in certain regions, we grew share in the public utility sector as our industry-leading brands and solutions were increasingly the preferred choice of customers worldwide. We executed our capital deployment strategy as planned, successfully completing three acquisitions that collectively expanded our systems intelligence offerings in a significant way and extended our business into global smart metrology. We are well underway with the integration of our recent acquisition, Sensus, a business that significantly advances our move into smart water infrastructure.”  

Decker continued, “This quarter we drove strong operating margin expansion by realizing the continued benefits from global procurement and lean and six sigma initiatives. In addition, order rates for the quarter increased two percent organically despite challenging market conditions. As we look to 2017, our organic and inorganic investments in 2016 along with continued improvements to our cost structure will pave the way for accelerated growth as we continue to execute on our investment thesis and increase shareholder value.”  

Xylem announced that its Board of Directors declared a dividend in the amount of $0.18 per share, an increase of 16.2 percent. The dividend is payable on March 15, 2017 to shareholders of record as of February 16, 2017.  

Xylem also announced plans to host an Investor Day on Tuesday, April 4, 2017, in Raleigh, North Carolina, at the headquarters of its newly acquired Sensus business.  

Full-year 2017 Outlook  

Xylem forecasts full-year 2017 revenue in the range of $4.5 to $4.6 billion, up 20 to 22 percent, including growth from previously announced acquisitions and projected unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange translation. On an organic basis, Xylem’s revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of one to three percent. 

Full-year 2017 adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 13.2 to 13.7 percent, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $2.20 to $2.35. This represents an increase of 8 to 16 percent from Xylem’s 2016 adjusted results. Excluding projected unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange translation, Xylem’s adjusted earnings per share growth is anticipated to be in the range of 12 to 20 percent. The Company’s adjusted earnings outlook excludes projected integration, restructuring and realignment costs of approximately $30 million for the year. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort.  

Fourth Quarter Segment Results  

Water Infrastructure  

Xylem’s Water Infrastructure segment consists of its portfolio of businesses serving clean water delivery, wastewater transport and treatment, dewatering and analytical instrumentation.  

   •   Fourth quarter 2016 revenue was $612 million, down two percent organically compared with the fourth quarter 2015. This decline reflects ongoing softness in the oil and gas sector and industrial end market, partially offset by continuing growth in the U.S. public utility sector and large project deliveries in Emerging Markets.  

   •    

Fourth quarter reported operating income for the segment was $105 million. Adjusted operating income for the segment, which excludes $7 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was $112 million, a two-percent increase over the same period in 2015.  

 Reported operating margin for the Water Infrastructure segment was 17.2 percent, flat versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points to 18.3 percent. Both results reflect cost reductions which more than offset inflation and lower volume.  

Applied Water  

Xylem’s Applied Water segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in residential and commercial building services, industrial and agricultural applications.  

   •   Fourth quarter 2016 Applied Water revenue was $351 million, a two-percent decline organically year-over-year. This performance reflects a weak U.S. industrial market, partially offset by improved performance in Emerging Markets, primarily driven by stronger results in China and Latin America.  

   •   Fourth quarter reported operating income for the segment was $48 million, and adjusted operating income, which excludes $7 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was $55 million, an 12-percent increase over the comparable period last year. Applied Water segment operating margin was 13.7 percent, up 80 basis points over the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin increased 230 basis points to 15.7 percent as cost reductions more than offset inflation as well as unfavorable mix and strategic investments.  

Sensus  

Xylem’s Sensus segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in smart metering, network technologies and advanced data analytics. Xylem completed its acquisition of Sensus on October 31, 2016, and these results reflect the segment’s performance for November and December 2016.  

   •   For the final two months of 2016, Sensus revenue was $132 million. The segment operated at a loss of $17 million, including $26 million of acquisition-related and restructuring costs. Excluding those costs, adjusted operating income for the segment was $9 million. Sensus began 2017 with $388 million in backlog, of which approximately half is expected to be realized in 2017.

Xylem Inc. Non-GAAP Measures  

Management reviews key performance indicators including revenue, gross margins, segment operating income and margins, orders growth, free cash flow, working capital, and backlog, among others. In addition, we consider certain non-GAAP (or “adjusted”) measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including but not limited to dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. However, other than with respect to total revenue, we only provide guidance on a non-GAAP basis and do not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as integration and acquisition-related costs, special charges and tax related special items. These adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial, operating and planning decisions. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators:  

“Organic revenue” and “Organic orders” defined as revenue and orders, respectively, excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency translation and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures. Divestitures include sales of insignificant portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation. The period-over-period change resulting from foreign currency translation assumes no change in exchange rates from the prior period.  

“Constant currency” defined as financial results adjusted for foreign currency translation impacts by translating current period and prior period activity using the same currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.  

“Adjusted Operating Income”, “Adjusted Segment Operating Income”, “Adjusted Net Income” and “Adjusted EPS” defined as operating income, segment operating income, adjusted net income and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude restructuring and realignment costs, Sensus acquisition related costs, gain on sale of businesses, special charges and tax-related special items, as applicable.  

“Free Cash Flow” defined as net cash from operating activities, as reported in the Statement of Cash Flow, less capital expenditures as well as adjustments for other significant items that impact current results which management believes are not related to our ongoing operations and performance. Our definition of free cash flows does not consider certain non-discretionary cash payments, such as debt.  

“Realignment costs” defined as costs not included in restructuring costs that are incurred as part of actions taken to reposition our business, including items such as professional fees, severance, relocation, travel, facility set-up and other costs.  

“Sensus Acquisition Related Costs” defined as costs incurred by the Company associated with the acquisition of Sensus that are being reported within operating income. These costs include transaction costs, integration costs, costs related to the recognition of the inventory step up and amortization of the backlog intangible asset recorded in purchase accounting.  

“Special charges” defined as costs incurred by the Company, such as interest expense related to the early extinguishment of debt during Q2 2016, financing costs related to the bridge loan entered into in Q3 2016 for the Sensus acquisition, initial acquisition costs not related to Sensus, costs incurred for the contractual indemnification of tax obligations to ITT and other special non-operating items.  

“Tax-related special items” defined as tax items, such as tax return versus tax provision adjustments, tax exam impacts, tax law change impacts, significant reserves for cash repatriation, excess tax benefits/losses and other discrete tax adjustments.
