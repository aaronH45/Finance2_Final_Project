CAYCE, S.C., Feb. 14, 2017â€” South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), principal subsidiary of SCANA Corporation (NYSE:SCG) (SCANA), and V.C. Summer Nuclear Station co-owner, Santee Cooper, have received information from Westinghouse Electric Company (WEC) officials that indicates WEC and its parent guarantor, Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba), are committed to completing the two new Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear units being constructed in Jenkinsville, SC.

In addition to this reaffirmation, Westinghouse provided SCE&G with revised in-service dates of April 2020 and December 2020 for Units 2 and 3, respectively. WEC intends to make the complete integrated project schedule supporting these dates available for SCE&G to review.
