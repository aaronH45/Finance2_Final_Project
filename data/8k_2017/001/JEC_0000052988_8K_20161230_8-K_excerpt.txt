 Item 8.01 Other Events  

As previously disclosed, on August 9, 2014, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (the “Company”) received a Notice of Arbitration from Motiva Enterprises LLC (“Motiva”) seeking monetary relief in excess of $8 billion from the Bechtel-Jacobs CEP Port Arthur Joint Venture (“BJJV”), a joint venture between Bechtel Corporation (“Bechtel”) and the Company. On December 30, 2016, the arbitral panel in this matter issued its unanimous decision, which rejected all of Motiva’s claims and assigned no liability to BJJV, the Company or Bechtel. BJJV intends to seek confirmation by a court of the final decision of the panel, which may be vacated only on certain narrow grounds.
