 Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

On February 24, 2017, Foot Locker, Inc. (the “Company”) issued a press release announcing its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which, in its entirety, is incorporated herein by reference. The press release includes non-GAAP financial measures of fourth quarter and full-year 2016 net income excluding an increase in tax expense due to a tax rate change in Europe, a reduction in tax expense due to a regulatory change in the United States, an after-tax impairment charge associated with the Runners Point and Sidestep banners, and a reduction in tax expense associated with a scheduled intellectual property reassessment in Europe. The press release also includes non-GAAP financial measures of fourth quarter and full-year 2015 net income excluding the impairment of certain Runners Point Group assets, and a charge related to pension litigation. 

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they allow for a more direct comparison of the Company’s performance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 to the Company’s performance in the comparable prior-year periods. The non-GAAP financial measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these measures is provided in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is part of the press release. 

The Company is hosting a conference call on February 24, 2017 to discuss its fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial results, provide its current outlook for 2017, comment on the status of its current initiatives, and discuss trends in its business and the athletic industry. 

In accordance with General Instruction B.2. of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
