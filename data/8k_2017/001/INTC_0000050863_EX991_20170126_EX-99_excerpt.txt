Forward-Looking Statements

The above statements and any others in this release that refer to Business Outlook, future plans and expectations are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "goals," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "continues," "may," "will," "would," "should," "could," and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Statements that refer to or are based on projections, uncertain events or assumptions also identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on management's expectations as of the date of this earnings release and involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Intel presently considers the following to be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's expectations. 

•Demand for Intel's products is highly variable and could differ from expectations due to factors including changes in business and economic conditions; consumer confidence or income levels; the introduction, availability and market acceptance of Intel's products, products used together with Intel products and competitors' products; competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors; supply constraints and other disruptions affecting customers; changes in customer order patterns including order cancellations; and changes in the level of inventory at customers. 

•Intel's gross margin percentage could vary significantly from expectations based on capacity utilization; variations in inventory valuation, including variations related to the timing of qualifying products for sale; changes in revenue levels; segment product mix; the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs; excess or obsolete inventory; changes in unit costs; defects or disruptions in the supply of materials or resources; and product manufacturing quality/yields. Variations in gross margin may also be caused by the timing of Intel product introductions and related expenses, including marketing expenses, and Intel's ability to respond quickly to technological developments and to introduce new products or incorporate new features into existing products, which may result in restructuring and asset impairment charges.

•Intel's results could be affected by adverse economic, social, political and physical/infrastructure conditions in countries where Intel, its customers or its suppliers operate, including military conflict and other security risks, natural disasters, infrastructure disruptions, health concerns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, sanctions and tariffs, and the United Kingdom referendum to withdraw from the European Union. Results may also be affected by the formal or informal imposition by countries of new or revised export and/or import and doing-business regulations, which could be changed without prior notice. 

•Intel operates in highly competitive industries and its operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. 

•The amount, timing and execution of Intel's stock repurchase program could be affected by changes in Intel's priorities for the use of cash, such as operational spending, capital spending, acquisitions, and as a result of changes to Intel's cash flows or changes in tax laws. 

•Intel's expected tax rate is based on current tax law and current expected income and may be affected by the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the estimates of credits, benefits and deductions; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities, including payment of interest and penalties; and the ability to realize deferred tax assets. 

•Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other could vary from expectations depending on gains or losses on the sale, exchange, change in the fair value or impairments of debt and equity investments, interest rates, cash balances, and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.  

•Product defects or errata (deviations from published specifications) may adversely impact our expenses, revenues and reputation. 

•Intel's results could be affected by litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual property, stockholder, consumer, antitrust, disclosure and other issues. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or an injunction prohibiting Intel from manufacturing or selling one or more products, precluding particular business practices, impacting Intel's ability to design its products, or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of intellectual property.

•Intel’s results may be affected by factors that could cause the implementation of, and expected results from, the restructuring plan announced on April 19, 2016, to differ from Intel’s expectations. A detailed description of risks associated with the restructuring plan and factors that could cause actual results of the restructuring plan to differ is set forth in the “Forward Looking Statements” section of Intel’s press release entitled “Intel Announces Restructuring Initiative to Accelerate Transformation” dated April 19, 2016, which risk factors are incorporated by reference herein. 

•Intel's results may be affected by the timing of closing of acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions. In addition, risks associated with our planned divestiture of the Intel Security Group are described in the “Forward Looking Statements” section of Intel’s press release entitled "Intel and TPG to Collaborate to Establish McAfee as Leading Independent Cybersecurity Company Valued at $4.2 Billion" dated September 7, 2016, which risk factors are incorporated by reference herein. 

Additional information regarding these and other factors that could affect Intel's results is included in Intel's SEC filings, including the company's most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, copies of which may be obtained by visiting our Investor Relations website at www.intc.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

SUPPLEMENTAL OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS

(In millions)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During the first quarter of 2016, we formed the Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) as a result of our acquisition of Altera. Additionally, we formed the New Technology Group (NTG), which includes products designed for wearables, cameras, and other market segments (including drones). All prior-period amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance starting in fiscal year 2016 and include other minor reorganizations. In the third quarter of 2016, we announced our planned divestiture of our Intel Security business and expect to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2017.

Revenue for our reportable and non-reportable operating segments is primarily related to the following product lines:

•Client Computing Group. Includes platforms designed for notebooks (including Ultrabook™ devices), 2 in 1 systems, desktops (including all-in-ones and high-end enthusiast PCs), tablets, phones, wireless and wired connectivity products, and mobile communication components.

•Data Center Group. Includes platforms designed for the enterprise, cloud, communications infrastructure, and technical computing segments. 

•Internet of Things Group. Includes platforms designed for Internet of Things market segments, including retail, transportation, industrial, and buildings and home use, along with a broad range of other market segments.  

•Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group. Includes NAND flash memory products primarily used in solid-state drives.

•Intel Security Group. Includes security software products designed to deliver innovative solutions that secure computers, mobile devices, and networks around the world from the latest malware and emerging online threats. 

•Programmable Solutions Group. Includes programmable semiconductors (primary field-programmable gate arrays) and related products for a broad range of market segments, including communications, networking and storage, industrial, military, and automotive.

We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments, and the expenses are included in the following operating results.

All other category includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:

•results of operations from NTG;

•amounts included within restructuring and other charges; 

•a portion of profit-dependent compensation and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments;

•divested businesses for which discrete operating results are not regularly reviewed by our CODM;

•results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives, including our foundry business; and

•acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.

A substantial majority of our revenue is generated from the sale of platforms. Platforms incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package. Our remaining primary product lines are incorporated in "other."

EXPLANATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES

In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this earnings release contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. 

Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Income tax effects have been calculated using an appropriate tax rate. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. 

Acquisition-related adjustments: The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the company exclude certain business combination accounting adjustments and certain expenses related to acquisitions as follows: 

•Revenue and gross margin: Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the deferred revenue write-down, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets that impact cost of sales, and the inventory valuation adjustment. 

◦Deferred revenue write-down: Sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for subsequent price adjustments and returns and are deferred until the products are resold by the distributor. Business combination accounting principles require us to write down to fair value the deferred revenue assumed in our acquisitions as we have limited performance obligations associated with this deferred revenue. Our GAAP revenues and related cost of sales for the subsequent reselling by distributors to end customers after an acquisition do not reflect the full amounts that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value. The non-GAAP adjustments made in the first quarter of 2016 eliminate the effect of the deferred revenue write-down associated with our acquisition of Altera. We believe these adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect revenue and gross margin trends of our business.  

◦Inventory valuation adjustment: Business combination accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. The fair value of inventory reflects the acquired company’s cost of manufacturing plus a portion of the expected profit margin. The non-GAAP adjustments to our cost of sales in the first half of 2016 exclude the expected profit margin component that is recorded under business combination accounting principles associated with our acquisition of Altera. We believe the adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect cost of sales and gross margin trends of our business.  

•Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets: Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangibles assets such as developed technology, trade names, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. We record charges relating to the amortization of these intangibles within both cost of sales and operating expenses in our GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. Consequently, our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.  

•R&D plus MG&A spending: Non-GAAP R&D plus MG&A spending excludes the impact of other charges associated with the acquisition of Altera, which primarily includes bankers fees, compensation-related costs, and valuation charges for Altera's stock based compensation incurred in the first quarter of 2016.  

Restructuring and other charges: Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other charges include asset impairments, pension charges, and costs associated with the Intel Security Group planned divestiture. We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures. We believe that these costs do not reflect our current operating performance. Consequently, our non-GAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. 

Gains or losses from divestiture: We are expecting a gain in 2017 as a result of our planned divestiture of the Intel Security Group. We have excluded this expected gain for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures. We believe making these adjustments facilitate a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results. 

Gross cash, net cash and other longer term investments: We reference non-GAAP financial measures of gross cash, net cash and other longer term investments, which are used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity and capital resources. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful to investors in understanding our capital structure and how we manage our resources.
