 Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.  

Effective October 3, 2016, PerkinElmer, Inc. (the “Company”) realigned its operating segments into the Diagnostics segment and the Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment, to better position the Company to grow in attractive end markets and expand share with its core product offerings through an improved customer focus, more value-add collaboration and breakthrough innovations.  

On December 21, 2016, the Company entered into a Master Purchase and Sale Agreement with Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (“Varian”) under which the Company agreed to sell its Medical Imaging business to Varian, and the Company has placed the Medical Imaging business into discontinued operations.  

The Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2017 will be the Company’s first periodic report to reflect the Company’s new segment structure and the exclusion of the Company’s Medical Imaging business from continuing operations. The Company has made available on the Investor Relations section of its website (ir.perkinelmer.com) unaudited historical financial data for the twelve months ended January 3, 2016 and the three months ended March 29, 2015, June 28, 2015, October 4, 2015, January 3, 2016, April 3, 2016, July 3, 2016 and October 2, 2016, respectively, that retrospectively reflect the Company’s new segment structure and the exclusion of the Company’s Medical Imaging business from continuing operations.  

The information in this Item 7.01 shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
