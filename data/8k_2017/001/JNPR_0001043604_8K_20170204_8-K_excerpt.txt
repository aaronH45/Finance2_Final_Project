Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

On February 6, 2017, Juniper Networks, Inc. (the “Company”) announced through its corporate blog that the Company and Pradeep Sindhu, the Company’s Executive Vice President, Chief Technology Officer, have agreed to redefine Dr. Sindhu’s duties and responsibilities so that he can reduce the time he spends at the Company and devote a majority of his time to Fungible, Inc. (“Fungible”), a startup company that Dr. Sindhu co-founded in 2015. Dr. Sindhu will remain employed with the Company as the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Scientist, and will continue to serve as the Company’s Chief Technology Officer in order to assist with the transition to his successor. The Company has commenced a search to identify a successor.  

Dr. Sindhu has also notified the Company on February 4, 2017 that, consistent with his transition to a new role at the Company, he will not stand for re-election as a Director of the Company at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”). Dr. Sindhu did not refuse to stand for re-election because of a disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices. In connection with the Annual Meeting, Dr. Sindhu will assume the position of Technical Advisor to the Board of Directors.  

A copy of the blog post by the Company is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. Information on our website is not, and will not be deemed to be, a part of this report or incorporated into any other filings the Company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
