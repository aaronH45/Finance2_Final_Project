•Announced acquisition of Western Refining, Inc. on November 17, 2016

SAN ANTONIO - February 6, 2017 - Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported fourth quarter net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Tesoro of $78 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to $54 million, or $0.45 per diluted share a year ago. Consolidated net earnings were $101 million for the fourth quarter 2016 compared to $83 million for the same period last year. EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2016 was $468 million compared to $388 million last year. Fourth quarter operating income and EBITDA include a pre-tax benefit of $123 million in 2016 and pre-tax loss of $276 million related to a lower of cost or market (LCM) inventory adjustment in 2015. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

“We made excellent progress in 2016 executing our growth and productivity improvement strategies. This included achieving very strong safety and refining availability, delivering annual improvements to operating income and making strategic acquisitions that position the Company for further growth. We returned approximately $500 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends and invested in high-return capital projects. We achieved these results despite a challenging market environment characterized by lower refining margins and weaker crude oil differentials,” said Greg Goff, Chairman and CEO.

“Looking ahead to 2017, we are excited about the potential opportunities that we see from an attractive refining market environment, strong consumer demand for gasoline and numerous strategic initiatives underway to continue to improve operating income. Additionally, we are looking forward to continued growth of Tesoro through our pending acquisition of Western Refining,” added Goff.

SEGMENT RESULTS

REFINING. Refining operating income was $43 million for the fourth quarter 2016 compared to $12 million in 2015 and segment EBITDA was $205 million compared to $146 million in 2015. Fourth quarter 2016 operating income and segment EBITDA include a pre-tax benefit of $123 million related to a LCM inventory adjustment compared to a pre-tax loss of $276 million in the fourth quarter 2015. 

The Tesoro Index(a) was $10.59 per barrel during the fourth quarter with a gross refining margin of $9.45 per barrel. This compares to the Tesoro Index of $15.60 per barrel with a gross refining margin of $9.05 per barrel in the fourth quarter 2015. The year-over-year comparisons of operating results and refining gross margins primarily reflect the relatively strong market conditions in 2015 as well as LCM impacts. Total refinery throughput for the quarter was 841 thousand barrels per day, or 94% utilization. Manufacturing costs in the fourth quarter 2016 decreased by 3% per barrel over last year to $5.43 per barrel primarily due to higher refinery throughput in the fourth quarter 2016. Total refinery utilization was 93% for 2016.

LOGISTICS. Logistics operating income increased to $123 million in the fourth quarter 2016 from $97 million a year ago and segment EBITDA increased to $177 million from $146 million last year. The performance of Tesoro Logistics LP (NYSE: TLLP) was driven by year-over-year growth in crude oil gathering throughput, terminalling and transportation throughput and contributions from the acquisitions of the Alaska Storage and Terminalling Assets completed during the third quarter 2016 and the Northern California Terminalling and Storage Assets completed in November. 

MARKETING. Marketing operating income was $169 million, segment EBITDA was $192 million and fuel margins were 11.4 cents per gallon in the fourth quarter 2016. This compares to operating income of $175 million, segment EBITDA of $187 million and fuel margins of 11.7 cents per gallon last year. Consumer demand remained strong, with year-over-year U.S. gasoline demand growth of approximately 1.6% and California gasoline demand growth of approximately 2.1%, through October. Additionally, U.S. vehicle miles traveled improved by approximately 3.1% year-over-year through November. The Company successfully executed its strategy of growing its branded station network, increasing total branded stations by 95 to 2,492 at the end of 2016. 

CORPORATE AND OTHER

Corporate and unallocated costs for the fourth quarter 2016 were $111 million and include approximately $3 million of costs related to the pending acquisition of Western Refining, Inc. (NYSE: WNR) announced in November 2016. Net interest was $84 million in the fourth quarter 2016, which includes $20 million of bridge financing costs and $2 million of additional interest related related to the pending acquisition of Western Refining. The effective tax rate was 39.2% for the quarter and 33.4% for the full year. 

BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW

Tesoro ended the fourth quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, up from $942 million at the end of 2015. This was primarily driven by proceeds from the $1.6 billion of senior notes issued during the quarter related to the announced acquisition of Western Refining and $672 million of higher cash and cash equivalents at TLLP. Tesoro has $2.0 billion of availability under its revolving credit facility and an additional $1.0 billion of availability under its new revolving credit facility that is contingent on the close of the Western Refining acquisition. As a result of the senior notes issuance to fund the Western Refining acquisition, total

debt, net of unamortized issuance costs, was $6.9 billion or 46% of total capitalization at the end of the fourth quarter. Excluding TLLP debt and equity, total debt was $2.9 billion or 35% of total capitalization. 

Capital spending for the fourth quarter 2016 was $233 million for Tesoro and $91 million for TLLP. Turnaround expenditures for the fourth quarter were $101 million. Capital spending for the full year 2016 was $676 million for Tesoro and $272 million for TLLP. Turnaround expenditures for the full year were $334 million. 

The Company paid cash dividends of $63 million in the fourth quarter 2016. For the full year 2016, Tesoro repurchased 3.2 million shares for $250 million and paid cash dividends of $249 million. Additionally, Tesoro today announced that its board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share payable on March 15, 2017 to all holders of record as of February 28, 2017. Tesoro continues to maintain a strong balance sheet while investing in high-return capital projects, pursuing strategic acquisitions and returning cash to shareholders.

STRATEGIC UPDATE

On November 17, 2016, Tesoro announced a definitive agreement under which Tesoro will acquire Western Refining in a primarily stock transaction. This transaction is an important step for Tesoro in its ongoing commitment to creating significant value for shareholders, employees and key community partners. The acquisition is expected to create a premier, highly integrated and geographically diversified refining, marketing and logistics company and provide a strong platform for earnings growth and cash flow generation. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2017 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the shareholders of both companies and the receipt of regulatory approval.

Also, during the quarter, Tesoro issued $1.6 billion in debt in the form of senior notes. The Company intends to use a combination of the net proceeds from senior notes, cash on hand and borrowings under its amended revolving credit facility to fund the cash consideration and other amounts related to Western Refining acquisition. Additional uses may include the repayment and redemption of certain outstanding indebtedness of Western Refining and its subsidiaries and the payment of related fees and expenses.

Additionally during the quarter, Tesoro sold the Northern California Terminalling and Storage Assets to TLLP for a total consideration of $400 million, which included cash proceeds of $360 million and the issuance of common and general partner units to Tesoro, valued at approximately $40 million.

On January 1, 2017, TLLP closed the previously announced acquisition of crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering systems and two natural gas processing facilities for total consideration of approximately $700 million. The North Dakota Gathering and Processing Assets include over 650 miles of crude oil, natural gas and produced water gathering pipelines, 170 MMcf per day of natural gas processing capacity and 18,700 barrels per day of fractionation capacity in the Williston Basin in North Dakota. 

The Company’s expectations for 2016 were a Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel, Marketing segment fuel margins of 11 to 14 cents per gallon and crude oil differentials reflecting transportation costs. For the full year 2016, the Tesoro Index was at the low end of the range and Marketing fuel margins were in line with expectations. Crude oil differentials were significantly narrower than expectations and resulted in lower year-over-year capture rates and refining profitability. For the full year 2016, Tesoro delivered an estimated $485 million of year-over-year improvements from higher utilization and operational efficiencies versus our original commitment of $500 to $600 million, which was revised to $400 to $500 million in the second quarter of 2016.

Additionally, the Company also committed to delivering $400 to $500 million of annual improvements to operating income in 2016, consisting of $200 to $250 million in Refining, $175 to $200 million in Logistics and $25 to $50 million in Marketing. For the full year 2016, we estimate that Tesoro delivered approximately $420 million of annual improvements to operating income, including Refining improvements of approximately $245 million, Logistics improvements of approximately $130 million and Marketing improvements of approximately $45 million. Estimated Logistics improvements were below the range primarily due to the weak commodity price environment, which impacted crude oil and natural gas volumes and organic growth.

2017 OUTLOOK

In November 2016, the Company issued its expectations for 2017, which include a Tesoro Index of $12 to $14 per barrel and Marketing segment fuel margins of 11 to 14 cents per gallon. In addition, Tesoro committed to delivering an estimated $475 to $575 million of annual improvements in operating income in 2017, excluding any expected synergies from the proposed Western Refining acquisition, through the execution of its growth and productivity plans. These improvements consist of $305 to $355 million in Refining, $125 to $150 million in Logistics and $45 to $70 million in Marketing. The Company expects total capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion, consisting of $870 million at Tesoro and $325 million at TLLP. Turnaround expenditures for the full year 2017 are expected to be $360 million.

(a)As a performance benchmark, we utilize crack spreads and the Tesoro Index to measure the difference between market prices for crude oil and refined products. Crack spreads are a commonly used proxy within the industry to estimate or identify trends in gross refining margins, while the Tesoro Index is more specifically designed around Tesoro’s assets. Crack spreads and the Tesoro Index can fluctuate significantly over time as a result of market conditions and supply and demand balances. For example, The West Coast 321 crack spread is calculated using three barrels of Alaska North Slope crude oil (ANS) producing two barrels of Los Angeles CARB gasoline and one barrel of Los Angeles CARB diesel. In comparison the Tesoro Index uses several crude oils and approximately 8 to 10 products to provide a potentially closer representation of the trends in the available margin. Our actual gross refining margins differ from these crack spreads and the Tesoro Index based on the actual slate of crude oil we run at our refineries and the products we produce or yield.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

Our management uses certain “non-GAAP” performance measures to analyze operating segment performance and “non-GAAP” financial measures to evaluate past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our GAAP financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). These financial non-GAAP measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include:

•EBITDA—U.S. GAAP-based net earnings before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expenses 

•Segment EBITDA—a segment’s U.S. GAAP operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses plus equity in earnings (loss) of equity method investments and other income (expense), net

•Debt to capitalization ratio excluding TLLP—the ratio achieved by dividing the net result of our consolidated debt less all debt owed by TLLP (both net of unamortized issuance costs) by the sum of our consolidated debt less TLLP’s total debt (both net of unamortized issuance costs) and our total equity less noncontrolling interest associated with the public ownership of TLLP

We present these measures because we believe they may help investors, analysts, lenders and ratings agencies analyze our results of operations and liquidity in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, including but not limited to:

•our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the refining, logistics and marketing industries, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods;

•our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and

•the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.

Management also uses these measures to assess internal performance, and we believe they may provide meaningful supplemental information to the users of our financial statements. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. See the tables below for reconciliations between each non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.

ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY

The TLLP financial and operational data presented include the historical results of all assets acquired from Tesoro prior to the acquisition dates. The acquisitions from Tesoro were transfers between entities under common control. Accordingly, the financial information of TLLP contained herein has been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of the assets acquired in the acquisitions from Tesoro prior to the effective date of each acquisition for all periods presented. The TLLP financial data is derived from the combined financial results of the TLLP predecessor (the “TLLP Predecessor”). We refer to the TLLP Predecessor and, prior to each acquisition date, the acquisitions from Tesoro collectively, as “TLLP’s Predecessors.”

(j)Gross refining margin approximates total refining throughput multiplied by the gross refining margin per barrel. Consolidated gross refining margin combines gross refining margin for each of our regions. Gross refining margin includes the effect of intersegment sales to the marketing segment and services provided by TLLP as well as the incremental expense or benefit associated with the LCM adjustments for all periods presented.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(l)Management uses various measures to evaluate performance and efficiency and to compare profitability to other companies in the industry, including gross refining margin per barrel and manufacturing costs before depreciation and amortization expenses (“Manufacturing Costs”) per barrel. We calculate gross refining margin per barrel by dividing gross refining margin (revenues for manufactured refined products sold less costs of feedstocks, purchased refined products, transportation and distribution) by total refining throughput. We calculate Manufacturing Costs per barrel by dividing Manufacturing Costs by total refining throughput.

(m)Sources of total refined product sales include refined products manufactured at our refineries and refined products purchased from third parties.
