Net Revenues  

Investment Banking  

Full Year  

Net revenues in Investment Banking were $6.27 billion for 2016, 11% lower compared with a strong 2015. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $2.93 billion, 16% lower compared with a strong 2015, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide transactions. Net revenues in Underwriting were $3.34 billion, 6% lower compared with a strong 2015, due to significantly lower net revenues in equity underwriting, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide volumes. Net revenues in debt underwriting were significantly higher, reflecting significantly higher net revenues from asset-backed activity and higher net revenues from leveraged finance activity. The firm’s investment banking transaction backlog decreased compared with the end of 2015. (3)   

Fourth Quarter  

Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.49 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, 4% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015 and 3% lower than the third quarter of 2016. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $709 million, 19% lower compared with a strong fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide transactions. Net revenues in Underwriting were $777 million, 16% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015, due to significantly higher net revenues in debt underwriting, reflecting higher net revenues from leveraged finance and asset-backed activity. Net revenues in equity underwriting were lower, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide initial public offering volumes. The firm’s investment banking transaction backlog increased compared with the end of the third quarter of 2016. (3)  

Institutional Client Services  

Full Year  

Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $14.47 billion for 2016, 5% lower than 2015.  

Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $7.56 billion for 2016, 3% higher than 2015, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in credit products and higher net revenues in interest rate products. These increases were partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in mortgages, as well as lower net revenues in currencies and commodities. Although market conditions improved during the latter part of 2016, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution operated in a challenging environment generally characterized by low interest rates, political uncertainty and slow global economic growth during the year.  

Net revenues in Equities were $6.91 billion, 12% lower than 2015, primarily due to significantly lower net revenues in equities client execution, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in cash products, primarily in Asia, as well as lower net revenues in derivatives. Commissions and fees were slightly lower and net revenues in securities services were essentially unchanged compared with 2015. During 2016, Equities operated in an environment characterized by lower client activity levels and generally low levels of volatility.  

For 2015, the fair value net gain attributable to the debt valuation adjustment was $255 million ($214 million and $41 million related to Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, respectively). Beginning in 2016, such gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income. (7)

Fourth Quarter  

Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $3.60 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, 25% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015 and 4% lower than the third quarter of 2016.  

Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $2.00 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, 78% higher compared with a difficult fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting higher net revenues across all major businesses, including significant increases in credit products and interest rate products. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution operated in an environment generally characterized by improved market conditions, including rising interest rates and tighter credit spreads.  

Net revenues in Equities were $1.59 billion, 9% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting lower net revenues in equities client execution, due to significantly lower net revenues in cash products, partially offset by higher net revenues in derivatives. In addition, net revenues in securities services were lower, reflecting the impact of lower average customer balances. Commissions and fees were also slightly lower. Although global equity prices generally increased during the quarter, Equities operated in an environment characterized by continued low client activity levels.  

For the fourth quarter of 2015, the fair value net loss attributable to the debt valuation adjustment was $68 million ($54 million and $14 million related to Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, respectively). Beginning in 2016, such gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income. (7)  

Investing & Lending  

Full Year  

Net revenues in Investing & Lending were $4.08 billion for 2016, 25% lower than 2015. This decrease was primarily due to significantly lower net revenues from investments in equities, primarily reflecting a significant decrease in net gains from private equities, driven by company-specific events and corporate performance. In addition, net revenues in debt securities and loans were lower compared with 2015, reflecting significantly lower net revenues related to relationship lending activities, partially offset by higher net gains from investments in debt instruments and higher net interest income.  

Fourth Quarter  

Net revenues in Investing & Lending were $1.48 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, 15% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015 and 6% higher than the third quarter of 2016. The increase in net revenues compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in debt securities and loans, driven by higher net interest income and higher net gains from investments. In addition, net revenues from investments in equities were slightly higher, reflecting higher net gains in private equities.  

Investment Management  

Full Year  

Net revenues in Investment Management were $5.79 billion for 2016, 7% lower than 2015. This decrease primarily reflected significantly lower incentive fees compared with a strong 2015. In addition, management and other fees were slightly lower, reflecting shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies, partially offset by the impact of higher average assets under supervision. During the year, total assets under supervision (3) increased $127 billion to $1.38 trillion. Long-term assets under supervision increased $75 billion, including net inflows of $42 billion, primarily in fixed income assets, and net market appreciation of $33 billion, primarily in equity and fixed income assets. In addition, liquidity products increased $52 billion.

Fourth Quarter  

Net revenues in Investment Management were $1.61 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, 3% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015 and 8% higher than the third quarter of 2016. The increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 was due to higher incentive fees and transaction revenues. Management and other fees were essentially unchanged compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision, offset by shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies. During the quarter, total assets under supervision (3) increased $32 billion to $1.38 trillion. Long-term assets under supervision increased $1 billion, including net inflows of $17 billion and net market depreciation of $16 billion, both primarily in fixed income assets. Liquidity products increased $31 billion.  

Expenses  

Operating expenses were $20.30 billion for 2016, 19% lower than 2015.  

Compensation and Benefits  

Compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits) were $11.65 billion for 2016, 8% lower than 2015, reflecting a decrease in net revenues and the impact from expense savings initiatives. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2016 was 38.1% compared with 37.5% for 2015. Total staff decreased 7% during 2016.  

Non-Compensation Expenses  

Full Year  

Non-compensation expenses were $8.66 billion for 2016, 30% lower than 2015, primarily due to significantly lower net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters, which are included in other expenses. In addition, market development expenses and professional fees were lower compared with 2015, reflecting expense savings initiatives. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for 2016 were $396 million compared with $4.01 billion for 2015 (2015 primarily related to net provisions for mortgage-related matters).  

Fourth Quarter  

Non-compensation expenses were $2.33 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, 44% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015 and 11% higher than the third quarter of 2016. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily due to significantly lower net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters, which are included in other expenses.  

Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $147 million compared with $1.95 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 (the fourth quarter of 2015 primarily related to net provisions for mortgage-related matters). The fourth quarter of 2016 included a $114 million charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. Compensation was reduced to fund this charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives.  

Provision for Taxes  

The effective income tax rate for 2016 was 28.2%, up from 26.9% for the first nine months of 2016 and down from 30.7% for 2015. The increase from the first nine months of 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in the impact of permanent benefits, partially offset by changes in the earnings mix. The decline from 2015 was primarily due to the impact of non-deductible provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters in 2015, partially offset by the impact of changes in tax law on deferred tax assets and changes in the earnings mix in 2015 and an increase related to higher enacted tax rates impacting certain of the firm’s U.K. subsidiaries in 2016.
