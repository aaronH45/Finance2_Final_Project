Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers 

On February 23, 2017, Theodore F. Craver, Jr. was appointed to the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Duke Energy Corporation (the “Corporation”), effective March 1, 2017. Mr. Craver was Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Edison International, the parent company of a large California utility and various competitive electric businesses, from 2008 until his retirement in 2016. 

The Board has determined that Mr. Craver has no material relationship with Duke Energy or its subsidiaries and is therefore independent under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Mr. Craver’s directorship will expire, along with the Corporation’s other directors’ terms, at the next annual meeting of shareholders. Mr. Craver has been appointed to the Finance and Risk Management Committee and Regulatory Policy and Operations Committee of the Board, effective March 1, 2017. 

As a non-employee director of the Corporation, Mr. Craver will receive a pro-rated payment of the cash and stock annual retainer, will receive meeting fees in accordance with the Corporation’s Director Compensation Program, as set forth on Exhibit 10.55 of the Company’s Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2016, and will be eligible to participate in the Corporation’s Directors’ Savings Plan, which is described in the Annual Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on March 24, 2016. Mr. Craver is subject to the Corporation’s Stock Ownership Guidelines, which require outside directors to own Duke Energy common stock (or common stock equivalents) with a value equal to at least five times the annual cash retainer (i.e., an ownership level of $450,000) or retain 50% of their vested annual equity retainer until such minimum requirements are met.
