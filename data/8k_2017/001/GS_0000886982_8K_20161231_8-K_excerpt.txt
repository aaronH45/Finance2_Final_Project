 Item 8.01. Other Events.  

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the “Company”) has amended its indenture under which it issues senior debt securities from time to time. These amendments will apply only to debt securities issued on or after January 1, 2017. These amendments will, among other things:  

   •    Provide that acceleration of the payment of principal will only be permitted for (i) specified payment defaults after a 30-day grace period and (ii) insolvency events;  

   •    Confirm that transfers of the Company’s assets substantially as an entirety to subsidiaries of the Company are permitted without restriction; and  

   •    Provide that events of default and remedies, including acceleration rights, will continue to be determined on a series-by-series basis, but for this and other purposes, “series” means securities with the same CUSIP number.  

These changes will only apply to any debt securities that were issued on or after January 1, 2017. For a description of these changes and related matters to consider when making an investment in the Company’s debt securities, please refer to the Prospectus dated January 6, 2017.  

The changes referenced above are set forth in the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated December 31, 2016, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee, which amends and supplements the Senior Debt Indenture dated July 16, 2008, between the Company and the Trustee.
