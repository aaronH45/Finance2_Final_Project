 AVERY DENNISON ANNOUNCES 

FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2016 RESULTS 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

GLENDALE, Calif., February 1, 2017 – Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE:AVY) today announced preliminary, unaudited results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. All non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this document are reconciled to GAAP in the attached tables. Unless otherwise indicated, comparisons are to the same periods in the prior year. 

“I am pleased to report another year of progress toward our long-term goals,” said Mitch Butier, President and CEO. “We drove strong organic sales growth and margin expansion through our strategy to accelerate growth in high value categories and disciplined execution in our base businesses. 

“Label and Graphic Materials had another outstanding year and the transformation of Retail Branding and Information Solutions is on track. Results in our newly created Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment were as anticipated, and it is well positioned for profitable growth. I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and focus on our continued success. 

“In 2017, we expect to again deliver solid sales and earnings growth,” said Butier. “We remain confident that the consistent execution of our strategies will enable us to achieve our long-term goal of superior value creation through a balance of profitable growth and capital discipline.” 

For more details on the company’s results, see the summary table accompanying this news release, as well as the supplemental presentation materials, “Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Financial Review and Analysis,” posted on the company’s website at www.investors.averydennison.com, and furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K. 

Fourth Quarter 2016 Results by Segment 

Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect the company’s new operating structure. The Label and Graphic Materials segment includes Label and Packaging Materials, Graphics Solutions, and Reflective Solutions (all previously reported in Pressure-sensitive Materials). The Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment includes Performance Tapes (previously reported in Pressure-sensitive Materials), Fasteners Solutions (previously reported in Retail Branding and Information Solutions), and Vancive Medical Technologies (previously reported as a standalone segment). Retail Branding and Information Solutions now includes tickets, tags, and labels for apparel, radio-frequency identification, and Printer Solutions. 

Organic sales change refers to the increase or decrease in sales excluding the estimated impact of currency translation, product line exits, and acquisitions and divestitures. Adjusted operating margin refers to income before interest expense and taxes, excluding restructuring charges and other items, as a percentage of sales. 

Label and Graphic Materials 

· Reported sales increased approximately 10 percent; on an organic basis, sales grew approximately 7 percent. Within the segment, sales in Label and Packaging Materials increased mid-single digits and the combined Graphics and Reflective businesses increased low-double digits on an organic basis. 

· Operating margin improved 70 basis points to 11.3 percent, driven primarily by the impact of higher volume. Adjusted operating margin also improved 70 basis points. 

Retail Branding and Information Solutions 

· Reported sales increased approximately 3 percent; on an organic basis, sales grew approximately 5 percent. 

· Operating margin improved 610 basis points to 9.3 percent, primarily due to lower restructuring charges. Adjusted operating margin improved 220 basis points as the net savings associated with the business model transformation and the impact of higher volume were partially offset by higher employee-related costs. 

Industrial and Healthcare Materials 

· Reported sales decreased approximately 8 percent; on an organic basis, sales declined approximately 10 percent, as expected. Strong growth in industrial was more than offset by an expected decline in healthcare categories. 

· Operating margin declined 360 basis points to 8.8 percent as the impact of lower volume was only partially offset by the benefit of productivity initiatives. 

Other 

Share Repurchases / Equity Dilution from Long-Term Incentives 

In 2016, the company repurchased 3.8 million shares at an aggregate cost of $262 million. Net of dilution, the company reduced its share count by 2 million. The cost of repurchases, net of proceeds from stock option exercises, was $191 million. 

Income Taxes 

The 2016 full year tax rate was 32.8 percent, in-line with our previous expectation of 33 percent. The tax rate in 2017 is expected to be in the low-thirty percent range. 

Cost Reduction Actions 

In 2016, the company realized approximately $82 million in pre-tax savings from restructuring, net of transition costs, and incurred pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $20 million, the majority of which represent cash charges. 

Outlook 

In its supplemental presentation materials, “Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Financial Review and Analysis,” the company provides a list of factors that it believes will contribute to its 2017 financial results. Based on the factors listed and other assumptions, the company expects 2017 earnings per share of $4.10 to $4.30. 

Excluding an estimated $0.20 per share for restructuring charges and other items, the company expects adjusted earnings per share (non-GAAP) of $4.30 to $4.50. 

Note: Throughout this release and the supplemental presentation materials, amounts on a per share basis reflect fully diluted shares outstanding.

Certain statements contained in this document are “forward-looking statements” intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements, and financial or other business targets, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results and trends may differ materially from historical or anticipated results depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to risks and uncertainties relating to the following: fluctuations in demand affecting sales to customers; worldwide and local economic conditions; fluctuations in currency exchange rates and other risks associated with foreign operations, including in emerging markets; the financial condition and inventory strategies of customers; changes in customer preferences; fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials; our ability to generate sustained productivity improvement; our ability to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions; the impact of competitive products and pricing; loss of significant contracts or customers; collection of receivables from customers; selling prices; business mix shift; timely development and market acceptance of new products, including sustainable or sustainably-sourced products; investment in development activities and new production facilities; integration of acquisitions and completion of potential dispositions; amounts of future dividends and share repurchases; customer and supplier concentrations; successful implementation of new manufacturing technologies and installation of manufacturing equipment; disruptions in information technology systems, including cyber-attacks or other intrusions to network security; successful installation of new or upgraded information technology systems; data security breaches; volatility of financial markets; impairment of capitalized assets, including goodwill and other intangibles; credit risks; our ability to obtain adequate financing arrangements and maintain access to capital; fluctuations in interest and tax rates; changes in tax laws and regulations, and uncertainties associated with interpretations of such laws and regulations; outcome of tax audits; fluctuations in pension, insurance, and employee benefit costs; the impact of legal and regulatory proceedings, including with respect to environmental, health and safety; changes in governmental laws and regulations; protection and infringement of intellectual property; changes in political conditions; the impact of epidemiological events on the economy and our customers and suppliers; acts of war, terrorism, and natural disasters; and other factors. 

We believe that the most significant risk factors that could affect our financial performance in the near-term include: (1) the impacts of global economic conditions and political uncertainty on underlying demand for our products and foreign currency fluctuations; (2) competitors’ actions, including pricing, expansion in key markets, and product offerings; and (3) the degree to which higher costs can be offset with productivity measures and/or passed on to customers through selling price increases, without a significant loss of volume. 

For a more detailed discussion of these and other factors, see “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” in our 2015 Form 10-K, filed on February 24, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Accordance with SEC Regulations G and S-K 

We report our financial results in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and also communicate with investors using certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for or superior to, the comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement presentation of our financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts, we believe that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures we provide are useful to their assessment of our performance and operating trends, as well as liquidity. 

Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities, or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP financial measures, may make it difficult to assess our underlying performance in a single period. By excluding the accounting effects, both positive and negative, of certain items (e.g., restructuring charges, legal settlements, certain effects of strategic transactions and related costs, losses from debt extinguishments, losses from curtailment and settlement of pension obligations, gains or losses on sales of certain assets, and other items), we believe that we are providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of our core operating results and liquidity measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are used internally to evaluate trends in our underlying performance, as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period. While some of the items we exclude from GAAP financial measures recur, they tend to be disparate in amount, frequency, or timing. 

We use the following non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying news release and presentation: 

Organic sales change refers to the increase or decrease in sales excluding the estimated impact of currency translation, product line exits, acquisitions and divestitures, and, where applicable, the extra week in our fiscal year. The estimated impact of currency translation is calculated on a constant currency basis, with prior period results translated at current period average exchange rates to exclude the effect of currency fluctuations. We believe that organic sales change assists investors in evaluating the sales growth from the ongoing activities of our businesses and provides greater ability to evaluate our results from period to period. 

Adjusted operating margin refers to income from continuing operations before interest expense and taxes, excluding restructuring charges and other items, as a percentage of sales. 

Adjusted income from continuing operations refers to reported income from continuing operations tax-effected at the full year tax rate, and adjusted for tax-effected restructuring charges and other items. 

Adjusted EPS refers to reported income from continuing operations per common share, assuming dilution, tax-effected at the full year tax rate, and adjusted for tax-effected restructuring charges and other items. 

We believe that adjusted operating margin, adjusted income from continuing operations, and adjusted EPS assist investors in understanding our core operating trends and comparing our results with those of our competitors. 

Free cash flow refers to cash flow from operations, less payments for property, plant and equipment, software and other deferred charges, plus proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, plus (minus) net proceeds from sales (purchases) of investments, plus (minus) free cash outflow (inflow) from discontinued operations. We believe that free cash flow assists investors by showing the amount of cash we have available for debt reductions, dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions. 

The following reconciliations are provided in accordance with Regulations G and S-K and reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
