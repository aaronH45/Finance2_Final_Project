EVERETT, WA, February 7, 2017 - Fortive Corporation (“Fortive”) (NYSE: FTV) today announced results for the fourth quarter 2016. Prior to July 2, 2016, Fortive operated as part of Danaher Corporation (“Danaher”) and the historical financial measures presented in this announcement for periods prior to July 2, 2016 were derived from Danaher’s accounting records and are presented on a carved-out basis.

For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, net earnings were $224.5 million. For the same period, non-GAAP adjusted net earnings were $237.7 million. Diluted net earnings per share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016 were $0.64. For the same period, non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.68.

For the fourth quarter of 2016, GAAP revenues increased 3.3% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, with core revenue growth of 3.5%.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this earnings release also references “adjusted net earnings,” “adjusted diluted net earnings per share,” and “core revenue,” which are non-GAAP financial measures. The reasons why we believe these measures, when used in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures, provide useful information to investors, how management uses such non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and other information relating to these measures are included in the supplemental reconciliation schedule attached. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial measures, but should instead be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures used by Fortive in this release may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings per Share

We disclose the non-GAAP measures of historical adjusted net earnings and historical and forecasted adjusted diluted net earnings per share, which make the following adjustments to GAAP net earnings and GAAP diluted net earnings per share, respectively:

•Excluding on a pretax basis amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

While we have a history of acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. We believe however that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation and that intangible assets related to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Furthermore, the forecasted adjusted diluted net earnings per share does not reflect certain adjustments that are inherently difficult to predict or estimate due to their unknown timing, effect and/or significance. 

In addition, because we were part of Danaher for the three month period ended December 31, 2015, we are also making the following adjustments to the corresponding historical GAAP net earnings as if the Separation had been effectuated at the beginning of the relevant period (the “Separation Adjustments”):

•Because the carved-out GAAP financial measures for the three-month period ended December 31, 2015 did not reflect the level of selling, general and administrative expenses, including stock-based compensation, that would have been incurred as a stand-alone, publicly traded company (“Estimated SG&A Level”), adding on a pretax basis additional expenses necessary for such costs to equal the Estimated SG&A Level; and

•Adding interest expenses on a pretax basis (based on the assumed borrowing cost of approximately 2.8% per annum) as if the outstanding indebtedness incurred in connection with the Separation had been incurred at the beginning of such period (“Additional Interest Expense”).

8

Management believes that the Separation Adjustments, when considered together with the corresponding carved-out GAAP financial measures, provide useful information to investors by helping to identify certain types or levels of additional expenses incurred as a stand-alone, publicly traded company after the Separation that may not have been allocated or reflected in the historical carved-out GAAP financial measures for periods in which we were part of Danaher. We believe that such adjustments, when presented with the corresponding carved-out GAAP measures, may assist in assessing the business trends and making comparisons of long-term performance before and after the Separation. We will not make the Separation Adjustments for any periods in which the Separation had been effectuated prior to the beginning of such period.

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by reflecting additional ways of viewing aspects of Fortive’s operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, help our investors to understand the long-term profitability trends of our business, and facilitate comparisons of our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers. The items described above have been excluded from, or added to, these measures because items of this nature and/or size occur with inconsistent frequency or occur for reasons that may be unrelated to our commercial performance during the period and/or because we believe the corresponding adjustments are useful in assessing our potential ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period.

We deem acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to our larger acquisitions) if we determine that such costs exceed the range of our typical acquisition-related transaction costs in a given period.

These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Core Revenue

We use the term “core revenue” when referring to a corresponding GAAP revenue measure, excluding (1) sales impacts from acquired businesses, (2) sales impacts from the Separation and (3) the impact of currency translation. References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to GAAP sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales or operating profit, as applicable, attributable to certain divested businesses or product lines not considered discontinued operations prior to the first anniversary of the divestiture. Sales impacts from the Separation refer to sales to or from Danaher made under agreements entered into, or terminated, in connection with the Separation prior to the first anniversary of the Separation. The portion of sales attributable to the impact of currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales from acquired businesses or the Separation) and (b) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales from acquired businesses or the Separation) after applying the current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestiture related items (including the impact of agreements with Danaher that were entered into or terminated in connection with the Separation) because the nature, size and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers. In addition, we exclude the 

9

impact of agreements that were terminated, or entered into, in connection with the Separation because management believes that excluding such impact may be useful to investors in assessing our operational performance independent of the impact of sales to Danaher resulting primarily from the Separation. We exclude the effect of currency translation from sales measures because currency translation is not under management’s control and is subject to volatility. We believe that such exclusion, when presented with the corresponding GAAP measures, may assist in assessing the business trends and making comparisons of long-term performance.
