 ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  

On January 10, 2017, in advance of a publicly webcast presentation at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on January 10, 2017, Danaher Corporation (“Danaher” or the “Company”) furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K the presentation slides attached hereto, which are incorporated by reference herein. The presentation slides attached hereto contain certain information regarding Danaher’s anticipated financial performance for 2016.  

Following is required reconciliation and other information relating to the non-GAAP measures included in the attached presentation slides:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, operating cash flow, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing Danaher’s results that, when reconciled to operating cash flow, helps our investors to understand Danaher’s ability to generate cash without external financings, strengthen its balance sheet, invest in its business and grow its business through acquisitions and other strategic opportunities (although a limitation of operating cash flow is that it does not take into account the Company’s debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures).  

This information shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
