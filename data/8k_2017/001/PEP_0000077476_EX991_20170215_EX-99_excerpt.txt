PURCHASE, N.Y. - February 15, 2017 - PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. 

“We concluded 2016 with another strong quarter of operating performance, capping off a successful year. We met or exceeded every financial goal we set for 2016, while delivering a good balance between revenue performance and productivity,” said Chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi. “Looking ahead to 2017, we expect solid financial performance despite anticipated continued macroeconomic challenges. Further, reflecting our commitment to providing attractive cash returns to shareholders, we are increasing our dividend per share for the 45th consecutive year, beginning with our June 2017 payment.”

Summary of Fourth Quarter Financial Performance:

•Reported fourth quarter results were impacted by: 

•A 53rd reporting week and the reinvestment of the corresponding operating profit benefit in certain productivity and growth initiatives (incremental investments); and 

•A charge resulting from the redemption of certain senior notes in accordance with the “make-whole” redemption provisions (debt redemption charge).

•Reported year-ago results were impacted by:

•A non-cash tax benefit associated with our agreement with the IRS which reduced our reserve for uncertain tax positions. 

•Reported fourth quarter and year-ago results were also impacted by:

•Pension-related settlements; 

•Restructuring charges in conjunction with the multi-year productivity plans we publicly announced in 2014 and 2012; and

•Commodity mark-to-market impacts. 

•See A-11 for further details on the above items.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Reported gross margin contracted 15 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 15 basis points. Core gross margin contracted 25 basis points and core operating margin expanded 90 basis points. Reported and core operating margin expansion reflect the implementation of effective revenue management strategies and productivity gains. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The reported effective tax rate was 22.7 percent in 2016 and 11.2 percent in 2015 (due to the non-cash tax benefit associated with the tax settlement referred to above). The core effective tax rate was 24.0 percent in 2016 and 22.5 percent in 2015.

•Reported EPS was $0.97, a 17 percent decline from the prior year, reflecting the impacts of pension-related settlements, the debt redemption charge this year, as well as the year-ago non-cash tax benefit. Foreign exchange translation negatively impacted reported EPS by 3 percentage points.

•Core EPS was $1.20, an increase of 13 percent. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, core constant currency EPS increased 15 percent (see schedule A-10 for a reconciliation to reported EPS, the comparable GAAP measure).

Discussion of Fourth Quarter Division Results:

In addition to the reported net revenue performance as set out in the tables on pages 2 and A-9, reported operating results were driven by the following:

Frito-Lay North America (FLNA)

Positively impacted by productivity gains and lower raw material costs, partially offset by operating cost inflation. The 53rd reporting week contributed 7 percentage points to reported operating profit growth, partially offset by incremental investments, which reduced reported operating profit growth by 4 percentage points.

Quaker Foods North America (QFNA)

Positively impacted by a prior year impairment charge related to our dairy joint venture and ceasing its operations (9 percentage points), as well as lower raw material costs and productivity gains. These gains were partially offset by operating cost inflation and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The 53rd reporting week contributed 5.5 percentage points to reported operating profit growth, partially offset by incremental investments, which reduced reported operating profit growth by 4 percentage points.

North America Beverages (NAB)

Positively impacted by productivity gains and lower raw material costs, partially offset by operating cost inflation. The pension-related settlement benefit in the prior year had a 5-percentage-point unfavorable impact on reported operating profit growth. The 53rd reporting week contributed 7 percentage points to reported operating profit growth, partially offset by incremental investments, which reduced reported operating profit growth by 3 percentage points.

Latin America 

Positively impacted by productivity gains and the impact of efficiency initiatives recorded in the prior year, partially offset by operating cost inflation, higher raw material costs (in local currency terms, driven by a strong U.S. dollar), higher advertising and marketing expenses, and adverse foreign exchange translation. Incremental investments reduced reported operating profit growth by 13 percentage points. Lower restructuring charges versus the prior year had a 10-percentage-point favorable impact on reported operating profit growth.

Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA)

Positively impacted by productivity gains, partially offset by operating cost inflation, higher raw material costs (in local currency terms, driven by a strong U.S. dollar), adverse foreign exchange translation and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Lower restructuring charges versus the prior year had a 19-percentage-point favorable impact on reported operating profit growth. The 

5

53rd reporting week contributed 1.5 percentage points to reported operating profit growth, partially offset by incremental investments, which reduced reported operating profit growth by 1 percentage point.

Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA)

Negatively impacted by operating cost inflation, higher raw material costs (in local currency terms, driven by a strong U.S. dollar), a charge associated with a recent tax law change as well as the net impact of efficiency initiatives. These impacts were partially offset by productivity gains, lower advertising and marketing expenses and favorable foreign exchange translation. Lower restructuring charges versus the prior year had a 10-percentage-point favorable impact on reported operating profit performance.

Summary of Full-Year 2016 Financial Performance:

•Reported full-year 2016 results were impacted by: 

•A 53rd reporting week offset by the corresponding incremental investments; 

•A debt redemption charge; and

•An impairment charge to reduce the holding value of our 5% indirect equity interest in Tingyi-Asahi Beverages Holding Co. Ltd. (TAB) to its estimated fair value (charge related to the transaction with Tingyi).

•Reported prior-year results were impacted by:

•An impairment charge related to our Venezuelan businesses;

•The deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries;

•A non-cash tax benefit associated with our agreement with the IRS which reduced our reserve for uncertain tax positions; and

•A charge related to a write-off of the recorded value of a call option to increase our holding in TAB (charge related to the transaction with Tingyi)

•Reported full-year and prior-year results were also impacted by:

•Pension-related settlements; 

•Restructuring charges in conjunction with the multi-year productivity plans we publicly announced in 2014 and 2012; and

•Commodity mark-to-market impacts. 

•See A-10 for further details on the above items.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Reported gross margin expanded 65 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 235 basis points. Reported operating margin expansion benefited from the impact of the 2015 Venezuela impairment charges. Core gross margin expanded 50 basis points and core operating margin expanded 80 basis points. Reported and core operating margin expansion reflect the implementation of effective revenue management strategies and productivity gains, partially offset by incremental investments. 

•Reported operating profit increased 17 percent and core constant currency operating profit increased 7 percent. The 2015 Venezuela impairment charges had a 17-percentage-point favorable impact on reported operating profit growth, and the Venezuela deconsolidation had 

8

a 2-percentage-point unfavorable impact on reported operating profit growth. The commodity mark-to-market net impact favorably impacted reported operating profit by 2 percent. The net impact of charges related to the transaction with Tingyi and the pension-related settlements each had a 4 percentage-point unfavorable impact on reported operating profit growth. The 53rd reporting week positively contributed 1 percentage point to reported operating profit growth, more than fully offset by incremental investments, which reduced reported operating profit growth by 2 percentage points.

•The reported effective tax rate was 25.4 percent in 2016 and 26.1 percent in 2015. The core effective tax rate was 24.5 percent in 2016 and 24.3 percent in 2015.

•Reported EPS was $4.36, a 19 percent increase from the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of the 2015 Venezuela impairment charges. Foreign exchange translation negatively impacted reported EPS by 3 percentage points. 

•The 2015 Venezuela impairment charges and the Venezuela deconsolidation had a net 26-percentage-point favorable impact on reported EPS growth and the Venezuela deconsolidation had a 2.5-percentage-point unfavorable impact on core EPS growth.

•Core EPS was $4.85, an increase of 6 percent from the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, core constant currency EPS increased 9 percent (see schedule A-10 for a reconciliation to reported EPS, the comparable GAAP measure).

•Cash flow provided by operating activities was $10.4 billion. Free cash flow (excluding certain items) was $7.8 billion.

Discussion of Full-Year 2016 Division Results:

In addition to the reported net revenue performance as set out in the tables on pages 7 and A-9, reported operating results were driven by the following:

Frito-Lay North America (FLNA)

Positively impacted by productivity gains and lower raw material costs, partially offset by operating cost inflation and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The 53rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to reported operating profit growth, partially offset by incremental investments, which reduced reported operating profit growth by 1.5 percentage points.

Quaker Foods North America (QFNA)

Positively impacted by prior year impairment charges related to our dairy joint venture and ceasing of its operations (17 percentage points), as well as productivity gains and lower raw material costs, partially offset by higher advertising and marketing expenses and operating cost inflation. The 53rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to reported operating profit growth, partially offset by incremental investments, which reduced reported operating profit growth by 1.5 percentage points.

North America Beverages (NAB)

Positively impacted by productivity gains and lower raw material costs, partially offset by operating cost inflation and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Pension-related benefits in the prior year reduced reported operating profit by 2.5 percentage points. The 53rd reporting week contributed 1.5 percentage points to reported operating profit growth, partially offset by incremental investments, which reduced reported operating profit growth by 1 percentage point.

Latin America 

Positively impacted by the 2015 Venezuela impairment charges and the impact of efficiency initiatives (4 percentage points) as well as current year productivity gains. These impacts were partially offset by operating cost inflation, the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation (which reduced reported operating profit growth by 19 percentage points), higher raw material costs (in local currency terms, driven by a strong U.S. dollar), adverse foreign exchange translation and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Incremental investments reduced reported operating profit growth by 4 percentage points. 

Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA)

Positively impacted by productivity gains, partially offset by higher raw material costs (in local currency terms, driven by a strong U.S. dollar), operating cost inflation, higher advertising and 

10

marketing expenses and adverse foreign exchange translation. Incremental investments reduced reported operating profit growth by 2 percentage points.

Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA)

Negatively impacted by the net impact of charges related to the transaction with Tingyi (32 percentage points), operating cost inflation and higher advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by productivity gains. Additionally, the impact from a prior-year gain related to the refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in India negatively impacted reported operating profit performance by 4 percentage points. This impact was partially offset by a prior-year impairment charge associated with a joint venture in the Middle East which positively contributed 3 percentage points to reported operating profit performance.

2017 Guidance and Outlook

The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict certain elements which are included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange and commodity mark-to-market adjustments. 

The Company expects 2017 organic revenue growth of at least 3 percent. Based on current market consensus rates, foreign exchange translation is expected to negatively impact reported net revenue growth by approximately 3 percentage points and the 53rd week in 2016 is expected to negatively impact reported net revenue growth by 1 percentage point. 

The Company expects 2017 core earnings per share of $5.09, driven by the following expectations and factors:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Further, the Company expects:

•Approximately $10 billion in cash flow from operating activities and approximately $7 billion in free cash flow (excluding certain items); and

•Net capital spending of approximately $3 billion.

The Company also announced a 7 percent increase in its annualized dividend to $3.22 per share from $3.01 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2017. Total dividends to shareholders are expected to be approximately $4.5 billion in 2017. In addition, the Company anticipates share repurchases of approximately $2 billion, resulting in expected total cash returned to shareholders of approximately $6.5 billion in 2017.

3 Based on current foreign exchange market consensus rates.

(a)Reclassifications were made to prior years’ amounts to conform to the current year presentation, including the presentation of certain functional support costs associated with the manufacturing and production of our products within cost of sales. These costs were previously included in selling, general and administrative expenses. These reclassifications resulted in an increase in cost of sales of $347 million for the full years 2015 with corresponding reductions to gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses in the same year. The quarterly impact of these reclassifications increased cost of sales by $61 million, $84 million, $95 million and $107 million for the quarters ended March 21, 2015, June 13, 2015, September 5, 2015 and December 26, 2015, respectively, with corresponding reductions to gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses in the same periods. These reclassifications reflect changes in how we are classifying costs of certain support functions as a result of ongoing productivity and efficiency initiatives. These reclassifications had no impact on our consolidated net revenue, operating profit, net interest expense, provision for income taxes, net income or earnings per share.

Non-GAAP Measures

In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): division operating profit, core results, core constant currency results, free cash flow, free cash flow excluding certain items, and organic results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.

We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); gains or losses associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; charges related to restructuring programs; asset impairments (non-cash); amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; pension and retiree medical related items; debt redemptions; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures included herein. 

Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.

Glossary

We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:

Acquisitions and divestitures: All mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.

Beverage volume: Volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our bottlers.

Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior year average foreign exchange rates.

Core: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our historical results. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items:

Commodity mark-to-market net impact: Change in market value for commodity contracts that we purchase to mitigate the volatility in costs of energy and raw materials that we consume. The market value is determined based on average prices on national exchanges and recently reported transactions in the marketplace.

In the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $60 million and $167 million of mark-to-market net gains, respectively, on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. In the quarter and year ended December 26, 2015, we recognized $1 million and $11 million of mark-to-market net gains, respectively, on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses, as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.

Restructuring and impairment charges

2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan

In the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred restructuring charges of $54 million and $160 million, respectively, in conjunction with the multi-year productivity plan we publicly announced in 2014 (2014 Productivity Plan). In the quarter and year ended December 26, 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $75 million and $169 million, 

A - 6

respectively, in conjunction with our 2014 Productivity Plan. The 2014 Productivity Plan includes the next generation of productivity initiatives that we believe will strengthen our food, snack and beverage businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency. The 2014 Productivity Plan is in addition to the productivity plan we began in 2012 and is expected to continue the benefits of that plan.

2012 Multi-Year Productivity Plan

In the quarter and year ended December 26, 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $42 million and $61 million, respectively, in conjunction with the multi-year productivity plan we publicly announced in 2012 (2012 Productivity Plan). The 2012 Productivity Plan included actions in every aspect of our business that we believed would strengthen our complementary food, snack and beverage businesses by: leveraging new technologies and processes across PepsiCo’s operations, go-to-market and information systems; heightening the focus on best practice sharing across the globe; consolidating manufacturing, warehouse and sales facilities; and implementing simplified organization structures, with wider spans of control and fewer layers of management. The 2012 Productivity Plan has enhanced PepsiCo’s cost-competitiveness and provided a source of funding for future brand-building and innovation initiatives. 

Charges related to the transaction with Tingyi 

In the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a pre- and after-tax impairment charge of $373 million to reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in Tingyi-Asahi Beverages Holding Co. Ltd. (TAB) to its estimated fair value. 

In the year ended December 26, 2015, we recorded a pre- and after-tax charge of $73 million related to a write-off of the recorded value of a call option to increase our holding in TAB to 20%. 

Charge related to debt redemption

In the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, we paid $2.5 billion to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900% senior notes due 2018 and 5.125% senior notes due 2019 for the principal amounts of $1.5 billion and $750 million, respectively, and terminated certain interest rate swaps. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $233 million to interest expense, primarily representing the premium paid in accordance with the “make-whole” redemption provisions.

Pension-related settlements

In the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax pension settlement charge of $242 million related to the purchase of a group annuity contract.

In the quarter and year ended December 26, 2015, we recorded pre-tax pension-related settlement benefits of $30 million and $67 million, respectively, associated with the settlement of pension-related liabilities from previous acquisitions.

Venezuela impairment charges

In the year ended December 26, 2015, we recorded pre- and after-tax charges of $1.4 billion related to the impairment of investments in our wholly-owned Venezuelan subsidiaries and beverage joint venture.

Venezuela deconsolidation 

Conditions in Venezuela, including restrictive exchange control regulations and reduced access to U.S. dollars through official currency exchange markets, have resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and the U.S. dollar. The exchange restrictions and other conditions have significantly impacted our ability to effectively manage our businesses in Venezuela, including limiting our ability to import certain raw materials and to settle U.S. dollar-denominated obligations, and have restricted our ability to realize the earnings generated out of our Venezuelan businesses. We expect these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. 

As a result of these factors, we concluded that, effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015, we did not meet the accounting criteria for control over our wholly-owned Venezuelan subsidiaries and we no longer had significant influence over our beverage joint venture with our franchise bottler in Venezuela. Therefore, effective at the end of the third quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries and joint venture using the cost method of accounting. We reduced the value of the cost method investments to their estimated fair values, resulting in a full impairment. The factors that led to our conclusions at the end of the third quarter of 2015 continued to exist through the end of 2016. 

A - 7

Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2015, our financial results have not included the results of our Venezuelan businesses. We do not have any guarantees related to our Venezuelan entities, and our ongoing contractual commitments to our Venezuelan businesses are not material. We will recognize income from dividends and sales of inventory to our Venezuelan entities, which have not been and are not expected to be material, to the extent cash in U.S. dollars is received. We did not receive any cash in U.S. dollars from our Venezuelan entities during the fourth quarter of 2015 or fiscal year 2016. We will continue to monitor the conditions in Venezuela and their impact on our accounting and disclosures.

Tax benefit

In the year ended December 26, 2015, we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $230 million associated with our agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all open matters related to the audits for taxable years 2010 through 2011, which reduced our reserve for uncertain tax positions for the tax years 2010 through 2011. 

Division operating profit: The aggregation of the operating profit for each of our reportable segments, which excludes the impact of corporate unallocated expenses.

Effective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.

Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities.

Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.

Free cash flow excluding certain items: Free cash flow, excluding: (1) payments related to restructuring charges, (2) discretionary pension and retiree medical contributions, (3) net cash received related to interest rate swaps, (4) the tax impacts associated with each of these items, as applicable, and (5) net cash tax benefit related to debt redemption charge. As free cash flow excluding certain items is an important measure used to monitor our cash flow performance, we believe this non-GAAP measure provides investors additional useful information when evaluating our cash from operating activities. See below for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP (operating cash flow).

Net capital spending: Capital spending less cash proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment.

Organic: A measure that adjusts for impacts of foreign exchange translation as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, including the Venezuela deconsolidation, for the comparable period. The Venezuela deconsolidation impact excludes the results of our Venezuelan businesses for 2015. This measure also excludes the impact of the 53rd reporting week in 2016. We believe organic revenue provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.

Raw material costs: Raw materials include the principal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products, our key packaging materials and energy costs.

2017 guidance

Our 2017 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the commodity mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses and restructuring and impairment charges. Our 2017 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. Our 2017 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Our 2017 organic revenue growth guidance also excludes the impact of a 53rd reporting week in 2016. We are not able to reconcile our full year projected 2017 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2017 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2017 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity hedges due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. We are also unable to reconcile our full year projected 2017 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2017 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2017 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.
