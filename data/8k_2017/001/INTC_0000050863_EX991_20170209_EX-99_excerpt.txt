Disclosures  

This presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures relating to our performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the Appendix at the end of this presentation. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by Intel should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to “Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures” in Intel’s quarterly earnings release for a detailed explanation of the adjustments made to the comparable GAAP measures, the ways management uses the non-GAAP measures, and the reasons why management believes the non-GAAP measures provide investors with useful supplemental information.  

Statements in this presentation that refer to Business Outlook, forecast, future plans and expectations are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,”  

“goals,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Statements that refer to or are based on projections, uncertain events or assumptions also identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on management’s expectations as of February 9, 2017 and involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s expectations are set in Intel’s earnings release dated January 26, 2017, which is included as an exhibit to Intel’s Form 8-K furnished to the SEC on such date. Additional information regarding these and other factors that could affect Intel’s results is included in Intel’s SEC filings, including the company’s most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Copies of Intel’s Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports may be obtained by visiting our Investor Relations website at www.intc.com or the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
