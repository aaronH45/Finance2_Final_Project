 Item 5.02(b). Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

On January 6, 2017, Mr. David P. Steiner resigned from his position on the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Waste Management, Inc. (the “Company”). In Mr. Steiner’s employment agreement, he agreed to resign from the Board when his employment ended. Mr. Steiner did not resign because of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices.  

Mr. Steiner’s departure from the Company entitles him to the payments and benefits set forth in Section 6(e)(i) – (e)(v) of his employment agreement dated May 6, 2002, as amended and previously filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2002. Mr. Steiner’s outstanding performance share unit awards will be prorated as provided for in Section 2.a. of Important Award Details in the award agreements that are Exhibit 10.1 to Forms 8-K filed on March 12, 2014, March 3, 2015 and March 2, 2016.  

The Company has entered into an agreement with Mr. Steiner (the “Separation Agreement”) setting forth additional terms of his departure from the Company. With respect to Mr. Steiner’s outstanding stock option awards, the Separation Agreement provides that Mr. Steiner’s departure from the Company shall be considered “Retirement” pursuant to the terms of each of the applicable award agreements. The Separation Agreement also expanded the post-employment covenants in Mr. Steiner’s employment agreement, including, but not limited to, the inclusion of a release and a “standstill” that were not required by his employment agreement.  

The Separation Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
