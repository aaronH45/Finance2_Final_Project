 Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.  

On January 29, 2017, the Company, Rite Aid Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Rite Aid”), and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “Amendment”) to the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 27, 2015 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Rite Aid and Merger Sub. As previously disclosed, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, as amended by the Amendment, Merger Sub will merge with and into Rite Aid (the “Merger”), with Rite Aid surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company.  

Based on the terms and conditions of the Amendment, the Company no longer expects any material accretion from Rite Aid in fiscal year 2017. This takes into account the extended timeframe for closing, the updated potential store divestitures, and the new per share merger consideration.  

The Company has therefore revised its guidance for fiscal year 2017, and now anticipates adjusted net earnings per share of $4.90 to $5.08.  

The Company continues to expect that it will realize synergies from the acquisition of Rite Aid in excess of $1 billion, to be fully realized within three to four years of the closing of the Merger. These synergies, as previously disclosed, are expected to be derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.  

 Item 8.01. Other Events.  

On January 30, 2017, the Company and Rite Aid issued a joint press release announcing that they had entered into the Amendment. A copy of the joint press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated in this Item 8.01 by reference.  

 Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” and “will” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, risks related to the satisfaction of the conditions to closing the acquisition in the anticipated timeframe or at all, including risks related to the failure to obtain necessary  

 regulatory and Rite Aid stockholder approvals and the possibility that the acquisition does not close, including in circumstances in which Rite Aid would be obligated to pay the Company a termination fee or other expenses and vice versa; risks related to the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including the possibility that the expected synergies from the proposed acquisition will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully; risks associated with the financing of the transaction; disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; negative effects of this announcement or the consummation of the proposed acquisition on the market price of the Company’s common stock; significant transaction costs; unknown liabilities; the risk of litigation and/or regulatory actions related to the proposed acquisition; other business effects, including the effects of industry, market, economic, political or regulatory conditions; future exchange or interest rates or credit ratings; changes in tax laws, regulations, rates and policies; competitive developments; and risks and uncertainties discussed in the reports that the Company and Rite Aid have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. The Company and Rite Aid expressly disclaim any current intention to update publicly any forward-looking statement after the date of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.
