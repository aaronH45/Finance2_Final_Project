For the year ended December 31, 2016, SCANA reported earnings of $595 million, or $4.16 per share, compared to earnings of $746 million, or $5.22 per share, for the same period in 2015. Earnings for 2015 included a $201 million, net of tax gain or $1.41 per share, from the sale of two subsidiaries, Carolina Gas Transmission (CGT) and SCANA Communications, Inc. (SCI). 

“We are pleased with our annual results and the continued growth in our electric and gas companies.” said Jimmy Addison, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “Our earnings outlook continues to support our long-term growth expectations, based upon expected customer growth and investment in our electric and gas infrastructure driven by the economies of the Carolinas.” 

SCANA’s earnings for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $124 million, or earnings per share of 87 cents per share, compared to $98 million, or earnings per share of 69 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 2015. 

FINANCIAL RESULTS BY MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS 

South Carolina Electric & Gas Company

Reported earnings for 2016 at South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANA’s principal subsidiary, were $526 million, or earnings per share of $3.68, compared to $480 million, or $3.35 per share, in 2015. Increased electric margins primarily from a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth, and favorable weather compared with the prior year, as well as higher gas margins, were partially offset by increases in operations and maintenance expenses, as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program including interest, depreciation, and property taxes. Abnormal weather increased earnings by 19 cents per share in 2016, compared to 8 cents per share in 2015. 

For the fourth quarter of 2016, SCE&G reported earnings of $93 million, or 65 cents per share, compared to $75 million, or 52 cents per share, in the same quarter of 2015. Abnormal weather decreased earnings by 8 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to a decrease of 14 cents per share in the same quarter of 2015. At December 31, 2016, SCE&G was serving approximately 709,000 electric customers and 358,000 natural gas customers, up 1.6 and 2.9 percent, respectively, over 2015.

PSNC Energy

PSNC Energy, the Company’s North Carolina-based retail natural gas distribution subsidiary, reported 2016 earnings of $57 million, or 40 cents per share, compared to $54 million, or 38 cents per share in 2015. This increase is primarily attributable to higher gas margins from customer growth and a North Carolina Utilities Commission approved rate increase that became effective November 1, 2016. These increases were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense, depreciation and property taxes. Reported earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $27 million, or 19 cents per share, compared to $24 million, or 17 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. At December 31, 2016, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 550,000 customers, an increase of 2.9 percent over the previous year. 

SCANA Energy Marketing 

SCANA Energy Marketing, which markets natural gas in deregulated energy markets, including Georgia where the Company does business as SCANA Energy, reported 2016 earnings of $30 million, or 21 cents per share, compared to $28 million, or 19 cents per share, in 2015. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $7 million, or 5 cents per share, compared to $2 million, or 2 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. These earnings increases are due to higher gas margins primarily attributable to more favorable weather in 2016 than in 2015.

Corporate and Other, Net 

SCANA’s corporate and other businesses, which include the holding company, and prior to their sales, CGT and SCI, reported a loss of $18 million, or 13 cents per share in 2016, compared to earnings of $185 million, or $1.30 per share in 2015. This decrease is mainly attributable to gains on the sales of CGT and SCI during the first quarter of 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2016, these businesses reported a loss of $3 million, or 2 cents per share, consistent with the same quarter of 2015. 

EARNINGS OUTLOOK

Based on 2016 GAAP earnings per share of $4.16, the Company estimates its targeted average annual earnings per share growth rate range to be 2 to 4 percent over the next 3 to 5 years due to the impact of incremental electric margins attributable to abnormal weather in 2016. Due to the significance of weather to SCE&G’s earnings and its unpredictability, the Company is not able to provide 2017 GAAP earnings guidance.

For 2017, the Company estimates that GAAP-Adjusted Weather-Normalized earnings per share will be $4.15 to $4.35, with an internal target of $4.25 per share. 

In addition to the GAAP basis long-term growth rate guidance above, the Company estimates its targeted average annual growth rate for GAAP-Adjusted Weather-Normalized earnings per share to be 4 to 6 percent over the next 3 to 5 years based on 2016 GAAP-Adjusted Weather-Normalized earnings per share of $3.97. 2016 GAAP-Adjusted Weather-Normalized earnings per share reflect downward adjustments of 28 cents per share pre-tax and a tax effect of 9 cents per share for a net of tax 19 cents per share to normalize weather in the electric business. 

The Company's management believes that these non-GAAP earnings and earnings growth measures provide a meaningful representation of the Company's fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period-over-period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data. In management's opinion, these non-GAAP measures serve as useful indicators of the financial results of the Company's

primary businesses and as a basis for management's provision of earnings guidance and growth projections. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures in part in making budgetary and operational decisions including determining eligibility for certain incentive compensation payments. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the GAAP measures of earnings per share or average annual earnings per share growth rate, but are offered as supplements to those GAAP measures.

Factors and risks that could impact future earnings are discussed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and below under the Safe Harbor Statement.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note (1): Pursuant to Orders of the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (SCPSC), other income for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects the recognition of $5 million of gains which had been realized upon the settlement of certain interest rate contracts and previously recorded as regulatory liabilities. Such gain recognition was fully offset by downward adjustments to revenues within electric margin and had no effect on net income. 

Note (2): During the third quarter of 2015, the SCPSC approved SCE&G’s adoption of updated, lower depreciation rates for its electric and common utility assets effective as of January 1, 2015. The SCPSC also approved SCE&G’s request that the reduction relating to the first half of 2015’s depreciation expense resulting from the adoption of these depreciation rates be offset with a corresponding reduction to the recovery of fuel costs (electric revenue). Accordingly, electric revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects a reduction of $14.5 million when compared to electric revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. 

Note (3): In the first quarter of 2015, SCANA sold two of its subsidiaries, CGT and SCI. The sales were closed on January 31st and February 20th of 2015, respectively. The gain on the sale of CGT was $136 million, or 95 cents per share, net of taxes and the gain on the sale of SCI was $65 million, or 46 cents per share, net of taxes.
