E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company

WILMINGTON, Del., Jan. 24, 2017 - DuPont (NYSE: DD), a science company that brings world-class, innovative products, materials, and services to the global marketplace, today announced fourth-quarter 2016 GAAP earnings of $0.29 per share and operating earnings2 of $0.51 per share. Prior year GAAP and operating earnings2 were a loss of $(0.26) and earnings of $0.27 per share, respectively. GAAP income from continuing operations before taxes was $353 million, including charges of $(599) million related to an asset impairment charge and transaction costs offset by a $382 million non-operating pension/OPEB gain. Prior year GAAP loss from continuing operations before taxes was $(421) million, including a $(775) million charge for restructuring costs. Refer to Schedule B for details of significant items excluded from operating earnings per share. 

For the full-year 2016, DuPont delivered GAAP earnings of $2.85 per share and operating earnings2 of $3.35 per share. Prior-year GAAP and operating earnings2 were $2.09 and $2.77 per share, respectively. 

Fourth-quarter sales were $5.2 billion, down 2 percent versus prior year as a 1-percent benefit from currency was offset by a 2-percent decline in local price and a 1-percent decline in volume. Volume declined as growth in Performance Materials, Electronics & Communications and Industrial Biosciences was more than offset by declines in Agriculture, due to timing of fourth-quarter seed sales primarily due to the southern U.S. route-to-market change. Excluding this timing change, sales would have increased 2 percent. Full-year sales totaled $24.6 billion, down 2 percent versus prior year due to a 1-percent negative impact from currency and a 1-percent decline in local price. Volume was flat as growth in Performance Materials, Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences was offset by declines in the other segments. Excluding the change in timing of fourth-quarter seed sales in Agriculture, sales decreased 1 percent. 

Free cash flow4 improvement of $1.6 billion for the year reflected higher earnings, lower capital expenditures, lower tax payments, working capital improvements, and the absence of Chemours cash outflows. 

“2016 was an important year for DuPont as we exceeded our expectations for earnings, cost savings, operating margin expansion and free cash flow improvement," said Ed Breen, chairman and CEO of DuPont. “We made excellent progress on our strategic priorities in 2016 to increase shareholder value, and we will build on this groundwork as we move into 2017. We look forward to closing the merger with Dow and are continuing to have constructive discussions with regulators in key jurisdictions. We now expect the merger to close in the first half of 2017, pending regulatory approval."

The following is a summary of business results for each of the company’s reportable segments comparing fourth quarter and full year with the prior year, unless otherwise noted.

Agriculture - For the fourth-quarter 2016, an operating loss of $19 million improved $35 million, or 65 percent. A benefit from currency of $78 million and cost savings, were partially offset by timing of seed deliveries, primarily related to the southern U.S. route-to-market change. Operating margins expanded by about 210 basis points. 

Full-year operating earnings of $1,758 million increased $112 million, or 7 percent, as cost savings and lower product costs were partially offset by timing of seed deliveries, primarily related to the southern U.S. route-to-market change and negative currency. Operating margins expanded by about 170 basis points. 

Electronics & Communications - Fourth-quarter 2016 operating earnings of $98 million increased $11 million, or 13 percent, on cost savings and volume growth in Solamet® paste. Operating margins expanded by about 115 basis points.

Full-year operating earnings of $358 million were even with the prior year as cost savings were offset by lower sales and a $16 million litigation expense. Sales declined on weakness in consumer electronics markets and decreased demand in the photovoltaic market impacting sales of Tedlar® film. Operating margins expanded by about 90 basis points. 

6

Industrial Biosciences - Fourth-quarter 2016 operating earnings of $67 million decreased $11 million, or 14 percent, primarily due to declines in CleanTech. Operating margins contracted by about 295 basis points. 

Full-year operating earnings of $270 million increased $27 million, or 11 percent, reflecting cost savings and an increase in sales, partly offset by a negative impact from currency. Operating margins expanded by 155 basis points. 

Nutrition & Health - Fourth-quarter 2016 operating earnings of $135 million increased $50 million, or 59 percent, on cost savings and a $27 million gain from an asset sale. Volume was flat as growth in sweeteners and probiotics was offset by declines in protein solutions. Operating margins expanded by 615 basis points. 

Full-year operating earnings of $504 million increased $131 million, or 35 percent, on cost savings, volume growth in probiotics and cultures and a $27 million gain from an asset sale. Operating margins expanded by about 400 basis points. 

Performance Materials - Fourth-quarter 2016 operating earnings of $328 million increased $47 million, or 17 percent, as lower product costs, cost savings, and increased demand in global automotive markets, more than offset the absence of $33 million in prior year benefits from the sale of a business and tax benefits associated with a manufacturing site. Operating margins expanded by 275 basis points. 

Full-year operating earnings of $1,297 million increased $81 million, or 7 percent as cost savings, increased volumes, and lower product costs, more than offset a $63 million negative impact from currency and the absence of $49 million of benefits from the prior year, comprised of a net benefit from a joint venture, the sale of a business and the realization of tax benefits associated with a manufacturing site. Operating margins expanded by about 180 basis points. 

Protection Solutions - Fourth-quarter 2016 operating earnings of $142 million decreased $5 million, or 3 percent, as cost savings were more than offset by higher costs due to lower plant utilization and the negative impact from currency. Operating margins contracted by about 60 basis points. 

Full-year operating earnings of $668 million increased $27 million, or 4 percent, as cost savings were partially offset by the impact of lower sales. Operating margins expanded by about 150 basis points. 

First-Quarter 2017 Outlook

We expect the merger to close in the first half of 2017, pending regulatory approval. Therefore, only guidance for the first quarter of 2017 is being provided. The company expects first-quarter 2017 GAAP earnings to decrease about 18 percent from prior year. The company’s first-quarter 2017 GAAP earnings include an expected charge of about $0.15 per share for transaction costs associated with the planned merger with Dow. Prior year GAAP earnings included a net benefit of $0.18 per share from significant items, primarily due to a gain on the sale of an entity. 

First-quarter 2017 operating earnings2 are expected to increase about 8 percent versus prior year driven by benefits from cost savings and the impact of the change in timing for seed deliveries, primarily related to the southern U.S. route-to-market change in Agriculture. These benefits are anticipated to be partially offset by the expected reduction in planted corn acres in the U.S.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

This earnings release includes information that does not conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures include the company’s consolidated results and earnings per share on an operating earnings basis, which excludes significant items and non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs (operating earnings and operating EPS), total segment pre-tax operating earnings, operating costs and corporate expenses on an operating earnings basis. Management uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performance of the company’s segments, including allocating resources and evaluating incentive compensation. From a liquidity perspective, management uses free cash flow, which is defined as cash provided/used by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Free cash flow is useful to investors and management to evaluate the company’s cash flow and financial performance, and is an integral financial measure used in the company’s financial planning process. Management believes that these non-GAAP measurements are meaningful to investors as they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the company and provide a more useful comparison of year-over-year results. These non-GAAP measurements supplement our GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided in schedules A, C and D. Details of significant items are provided in schedule B.

For fourth quarter 2016 and full year 2016, the effective tax rate for the total of pre-tax charges was 32.2% and 27.0%, respectively. A significant portion of the transaction costs are in the US; however, those costs are not always tax-deductible. In addition, the Company incurred $(20) in the fourth quarter 2016 of other tax costs related to the planned merger and related activities. 

 Third quarter and first quarter 2015 included charges of $(9) and $(12), respectively, recorded in other operating charges associated with transaction costs related to the separation of the Performance Chemicals segment. Second quarter 2015 included charges of $(25) associated with transaction costs related to the separation of the Performance Chemicals segment consisting of $(5) recorded in other operating charges and $(20) recorded in interest expense. Second quarter 2015 also includes a tax charge of $(17) due to a state tax rate change associated with the separation. 

(2)

Fourth, third, second and first quarter 2016 included benefits / (charges) of $14, $(17), $90 and $(2), respectively, associated with the 2016 Global Cost Savings and Restructuring Program. The fourth and second quarter benefits were primarily due to the reduction in severance and related benefit costs due to the elimination of positions at a lower cost than expected. The charges in the third and first quarters were primarily due to identification of additional asset-related charges with the first quarter charge being offset by reduction in severance and related benefit costs. The third quarter charge consisted of $(14) recorded in employee separation/asset related charges, net and $(3) recorded to other income, net. The fourth, second and first quarter benefits / (charges) were recorded in employee separation/asset related charges, net. 

 Fourth quarter 2015 included a $(798) restructuring charge consisting of $(793) recorded in employee separation/asset related charges, net and $(5) recorded in other income, net associated with structural actions across all businesses and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating businesses and aligning staff functions more closely with them. The charge included $(656) of severance and related benefit costs, $(109) of asset related charges, and $(33) of contract termination costs. 

Fourth quarter 2016 included a benefit of $7 for reductions to the first quarter 2016 charge for La Porte site contract termination costs within the Agriculture segment. The first quarter 2016 included a $(75) restructuring charge related to the decision to not re-start the segment's insecticide manufacturing facility at the La Porte site located in La Porte, Texas. The first quarter charge included $(41) of asset related charges, $(18) of contract termination costs, and $(16) of employee severance and related benefit costs. The fourth quarter 2016 benefit and first quarter 2016 charge were recorded in employee separation/asset related charges, net. 

Fourth quarter 2016 and fourth quarter 2015 included benefits of $21 and $23 for reductions to the previously recognized severance costs related to the 2014 restructuring program. Second quarter 2015 included a $(2) net restructuring charge primarily due to the identification of additional projects in certain segments, offset by lower than estimated individual severance costs and workforce reductions achieved through non-severance programs. The activity in 2016 and 2015 related to the 2014 restructuring program was recorded in employee separation/asset related charges, net. 

(3)During the fourth quarter 2016, a $(435) pre-tax impairment charge was recorded in employee separation / asset related charges, net related to the write-down of the company's uncompleted enterprise resource planning (ERP) system which the company had elected to defer further testing and deployment in fourth quarter 2015. The company intends to complete the ERP project, however, given the uncertainties related to timing as well as potential developments and changes to technologies in the market place at the time of restart, it can no longer be considered probable. 

 During third quarter 2016, a $(158) pre-tax impairment charge was recorded in employee separation / asset related charges, net related to the write-down of indefinite lived intangible assets within the Industrial Biosciences segment. The third quarter charge was the result of realignment of brand marketing strategies and a determination to phase out the use of certain acquired trade names. 

 During first quarter 2015, a $(37) pre-tax impairment charge was recorded in employee separation / asset related charges, net for a cost basis investment within the Other segment. The assessment resulted from the venture's revised operating plan reflecting underperformance of its European wheat based ethanol facility and deteriorating European ethanol market conditions. 

(4)

In the second quarter 2016, third quarter 2015 and first quarter 2015, the company recorded insurance recoveries of $30, $147 and $35, respectively, in other operating charges for recovery of costs for customer claims related to the use of the Agriculture's segment Imprelis® herbicide.

(7)Fourth and second quarter 2015 included gains of $33 and $112, respectively, net of legal expenses, recorded in other income, net related to the company's settlement of a legal claim. This matter relates to the Protection Solutions segment.

(8)Unless specifically addressed in notes above, the income tax effect on significant items is calculated based upon the enacted tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment.

(9)Earnings per share for the year may not equal the sum of quarterly earnings per share due to the changes in average share calculations.
