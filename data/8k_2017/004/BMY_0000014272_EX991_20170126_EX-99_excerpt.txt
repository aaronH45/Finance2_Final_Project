2017 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE

Bristol-Myers Squibb is confirming its 2017 GAAP EPS guidance range of $2.47 - $2.67 and is adjusting its non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $2.85 - $3.05 to $2.70 - $2.90. Both GAAP and non-GAAP guidance assume current exchange rates. 2017 GAAP and non-GAAP line-item guidance assumptions include:

•Worldwide revenues increasing in the low-single digits.

•Gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 72% to 73% for both GAAP and non-GAAP.

•Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreasing in the mid- to high-single digit range for both GAAP and non-GAAP.

•Research and development expenses increasing in the high-single digit range for both GAAP and non-GAAP.

•An effective tax rate of approximately 21% for both GAAP and non-GAAP.

As previously announced in the third quarter of 2016, the company’s operating model is evolving, to drive the company’s continued success in the near- and long-term. The majority of costs are expected to be incurred by 2020. Although GAAP operating expenses may increase initially as restructuring and other charges are incurred relating to this evolution, the company expects non-GAAP operating expenses to be roughly flat with 2016 levels through 2020.

The financial guidance excludes the impact of any potential future strategic acquisitions and divestitures and any specified items that have not yet been identified and quantified. The guidance also assumes no generic entry for Sprycel in Europe following the appeal of the European Patent Office’s decision. The non-GAAP guidance also excludes other specified items as discussed under “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.” Details reconciling GAAP amounts to non-GAAP amounts, with non-GAAP reflecting specified items are provided in supplemental materials attached to this press release and available on the company’s website.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, that are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. These items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods including restructuring costs, accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, R&D charges in connection with the acquisition or licensing of third party intellectual property rights, divestiture gains or losses, pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges and debt redemption gains or losses, among other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. Non-GAAP information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting for future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP.
