 Item 2.02Results of Operations and Financial Condition. 

On February 8, 2017, the Company issued a press release announcing its results of operations for its first fiscal quarter ended January 15, 2017. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. 

In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the Company provides information regarding Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”), Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”) and Adjusted ROIC in the press release as additional information about its operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The Company’s management believes that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. In addition, management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company as well as a component of incentive compensation. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus charges for Mr. Robb’s separation agreement. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company defines ROIC as net income less interest expense, net of tax (“ROIC earnings”) divided by average invested capital. Adjustments to ROIC earnings for the Adjusted ROIC calculation include charges related to Mr. Robb’s separation agreement in Q1 2017, store and facility closures and asset impairments. Invested capital reflects a trailing four-quarter average. The press release includes a tabular reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP net income, which the Company believes to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 

The information contained in this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. Furthermore, the information contained in this Item 2.02 or Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
