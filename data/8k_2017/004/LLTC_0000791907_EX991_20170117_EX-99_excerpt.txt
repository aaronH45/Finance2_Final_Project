 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS SEQUENTIAL INCREASES IN REVENUE, NET INCOME, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE. THE COMPANY INCREASES THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND $0.01 TO $0.33 PER SHARE  

 ﻿  

 Milpitas, California, January 17, 2017, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ:LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the fiscal quarter ended January 1, 2017. Quarterly revenues of $375.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 increased $1.9 million or 0.5% over the previous quarter’s revenue of $373.9 million and increased $28.7 million or 8.3% over the $347.1 million reported in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.  

 ﻿  

 On a GAAP basis, net income of $124.0 million increased $8.9 million or 7.7% over the previous quarter’s net income of $115.1 million and increased $2.5 million or 2.0% over the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Diluted earnings per share of $0.50 per share in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 increased $0.03 per share or 6% over the previous quarter and was unchanged from the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.  

 ﻿  

 According to Lothar Maier, CEO, “Revenue for our second fiscal quarter of $375.8 million was slightly higher than we guided and is up 8.3% over the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. This is a good result in what historically has been a weaker seasonal quarter for us. On a non-GAAP basis excluding merger-related charges totaling $10.8 million, non-GAAP gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share were 76.3%, 45.5% and $0.54, respectively, all increases over the prior quarter. The increase in revenue was aided by an increase in our Communication and Industrial markets while gross margin was up slightly primarily due to a richer product mix.  

 ﻿  

 Due to the pending merger with Analog Devices, Inc., we expect that this will be our final earnings release as an independent company. We would like to thank our long-term investors who trusted our long-term market and operational strategies. Finally, we would like to thank the employees of Linear Technology who together over the course of 35 years helped to create a truly special company.”

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $88.7 million over the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 to $1.61 billion. The Company's Board of Directors approved an increase in the Company's quarterly dividend from $0.32 per share to $0.33 per share. This marked the 25th consecutive year the Company has increased its dividend. A cash dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on March 7, 2017 to stockholders of record on February 24, 2017. During the second quarter the Company generated positive cash flows from operations of $179.5 million or 48% of total revenues. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 the Company paid $78.7 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, representing $0.32 per share. There were no open market stock repurchases as the Analog Merger Agreement restricts the ability of the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock.

 As a result of the pending transaction with Analog Devices, the Company will not hold a quarterly earnings conference call.

 To supplement the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, certain non-GAAP financial information is provided, which is adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain costs and expenses, and adjusted for their tax effects. However, because there are no standardized or generally accepted definitions for most non-GAAP financial metrics, definitions of non-GAAP financial metrics (e.g. determining which costs and expenses to exclude when calculating such a metric) are inherently subject to judgement. The non-GAAP and supplemental information is provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of operating performance and prospects in the future. The presentation of non-GAAP and supplemental information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared and presented in accordance with United States GAAP. The following charges are presented as a non-GAAP financial metric as they are considered to be non-recurring by nature, and therefore are not indicative of core operating results, as they represent costs incurred as a result of the pending merger between Linear Technology and Analog Devices as announced on July 26, 2016:  

 ﻿  

 Merger-related charges that are directly related to the pending merger between Linear Technology and Analog Devices. Charges primarily include costs for advisory services, appraisals, legal services, employee-related expense and auditing services. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these items as they are not indicative of ongoing operating results and therefore limit comparability and excluding these items helps investors compare our operating performance with our results in prior periods as well as with the performance of other companies.  

 ﻿  

 Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. Includes the income tax effects of the excluded item noted above. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude the tax effects of the items noted above in order to present a more meaningful measure of non-GAAP net income.
