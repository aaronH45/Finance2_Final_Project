        "In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an update to simplify the accounting for employee share-based payments, including the income tax impacts, the classification on the statement of cash flows, and forfeitures. We elected to early adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized in the income statement rather than in additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet. As a result of applying this change prospectively, we recognized $7.0 of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017."
