Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure  

Broadcom Limited (“Broadcom” or the “Company”) will be meeting with investors and potential investors during the week beginning January 9, 2016. In connection with those meetings, Broadcom intends to make a presentation relating to the Company available to such investors and potential investors. Exhibit 99.1 contains selected financial information included in this presentation that is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).  

The non-GAAP data shown in Exhibit 99.1 include the effect, where applicable, of purchase accounting on revenues, and excludes, where applicable, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, purchase accounting effect on inventory, settlement costs and other charges, net, depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets) and capital expenditures. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company’s underlying performance. However, internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to the Company’s operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Company’s competitors. The presentation of these and other similar items in Broadcom’s non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual. Broadcom believes this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company’s on-going performance and has therefore chosen to provide this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company’s on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors and potential investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data included in Exhibit 99.1.
