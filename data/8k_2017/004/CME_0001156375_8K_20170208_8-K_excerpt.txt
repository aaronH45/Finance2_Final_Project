   Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.    

  On February 8, 2017, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of CME Group Inc. (the "Company") amended and restated the Company’s Bylaws (as so amended and restated, the "Bylaws") primarily to implement "proxy access." Section 1.13 has been added to the Bylaws to permit a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning three percent or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials director candidates constituting up to the greater of two individuals or 20% of the number of directors elected by the Company’s Class A and Class B shareholders voting together, provided that the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws. Proxy access will first be available to shareholders in connection with the Company’s 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. 

The Bylaws were also amended to (i) make clarifications, updates and refinements to the advance notice bylaws contained in Section 1.1 and Section 1.2 and to the provisions related to the submission of a questionnaire, representation and agreement by director nominees contained in Section 1.3, (ii) clarify the voting standard for the election of Class B directors contained in Section 1.8 and (iii) make certain other conforming and technical changes.

The foregoing description of the amendments to the Bylaws is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is included as Exhibit 3.1 to this report.
