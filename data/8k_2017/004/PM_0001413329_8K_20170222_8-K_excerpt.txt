Item 7.01.Regulation FD Disclosure

On February 22, 2017, Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI”) is hosting a live audio webcast of a presentation at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference where PMI’s Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jacek Olczak, will address investors. PMI has issued a press release announcing the highlights of the presentation. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference to this Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Adjusted diluted EPS is not a U.S. GAAP measure. PMI defines adjusted diluted EPS as reported diluted EPS adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items. PMI believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure as it represents core earnings, improves comparability and helps investors analyze business performance and trends. Adjusted diluted EPS should be considered neither in isolation nor as a substitute for reported diluted EPS prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our 2016 reported and adjusted diluted EPS was $4.48. During 2016, we did not have an EPS impact related to asset impairment and exit costs, and discrete tax items.

In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 hereto, shall not be deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as may be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing or document.
