 Item 8.01 Other Events.  

On February 22, 2017, The J. M. Smucker Company (the “Company”) entered into a share repurchase plan (the “Plan”) established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), in connection with the 6,586,598 remaining common shares authorized for repurchase by the Company’s Board of Directors as of the Company’s fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2017. A Rule 10b5-1 plan allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be unable to do so under the Exchange Act’s insider trading rules or during self-imposed trading blackout periods.  

The Plan will facilitate purchases of the Company’s common shares under its authorized share repurchase program. The Company’s designated broker will have authority under the Plan to repurchase up to 3,000,000 of the remaining 6,586,598 common shares authorized for repurchase commencing on February 27, 2017 and expiring on October 31, 2017, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Repurchases under the Plan will be subject to specified parameters and certain price and volume restraints as established in the Plan. Therefore, there is no guarantee as to the exact number of common shares that will be repurchased. Any repurchased shares will be held in treasury.
