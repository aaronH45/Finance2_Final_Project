ATLANTA, February 8, 2017 -- Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) today announced financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2016. 

“The business had an outstanding performance in the fourth quarter, delivering results that exceeded both our revenue and EPS guidance. Equifax ends the year with record results and enters 2017 with outstanding momentum across all business units and centers of excellence,” said Richard F. Smith, Equifax’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 

Financial Results Summary

The company reported revenue of $801.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 20 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2015 and a 23 percent increase in local currency. 

Fourth quarter diluted EPS attributable to Equifax was $1.01, an increase of 9 percent as compared to fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax was $1.42, up 25 percent as compared to fourth quarter of 2015. This financial measure for 2016 excludes the accrual for certain legal settlements, and the realignment of internal resources. The financial measure for both 2016 and 2015 excludes the acquisition-related amortization expense, net of associated tax impacts, and Veda acquisition related amounts, as described more fully in the attached Q&A.

For the full year 2016, revenue was $3.1 billion, an 18 percent increase from 2015. Diluted EPS attributable to Equifax was $4.04, a 14 percent increase from the prior year. Full year adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax was $5.52, up 23 percent percent from the prior year period. For the full year 2016, operating margin was 26.0% compared to 26.1% for the prior year. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.8 percent compared to 34.7 percent in 2015. These financial measures for 2016 and 2015 have been adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance and are described more fully in the attached Q&A.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Full Year 2017 and First Quarter Outlook

For the full year we anticipate revenue between $3.375 billion and $3.425 billion, and Adjusted EPS between $5.96 and $6.10. Given the recent strength of the US dollar, at current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency to negatively impact 2017 revenue growth by approximately 1% and Adjusted EPS by slightly over $0.02. On a constant currency basis, revenue is expected to grow 8% to 9% in 2017 and Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 9% to 11%.

“This compares favorably to the outlook we discussed when we released our third quarter earnings in October", said Richard F. Smith, Equifax’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “At that time, our expectation was to deliver revenue growth in 2017 at the high end of our total growth model of 7% to 10% assuming a flat mortgage origination market. Since that time, our mortgage origination outlook has changed to down 15%. This creates a 3% headwind to our growth rate in 2017 which we have offset with New Product Innovation and Enterprise Growth Initiatives.” 

For the first quarter, we anticipate revenue between $822 million and $826 million, and Adjusted EPS between $1.39 and $1.42. Given the recent strength of the US dollar, at current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency to negatively impact revenue growth by almost 1%, and Adjusted EPS by just under $0.01. On a constant currency basis, revenue is expected to grow 14% and Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 14% to 16%.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures

Acquisition-related amortization expense, net of tax - We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the significant cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management believes excluding the impact of amortization expense is useful because excluding acquisition-related amortization, and other items that are not comparable, allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Certain acquired intangibles result in significant cash income tax savings which are not reflected in earnings. Management believes that including a benefit to reflect the cash income tax savings is useful as it allows investors to better value Equifax. Management makes these adjustments to earnings when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. 

Veda acquisition related amounts for transaction expenses incurred as a direct result of the acquisition, as well as integration expense in the first year following the closure of the acquisition - During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded a charge of $5.0 million ($3.5 million, net of tax) for Veda acquisition related amounts other than acquisition-related amortization, of which $4.6 million related to integration costs is included in operating income, $0.2 million is recorded in depreciation and amortization, and $0.2 million related to foreign exchange loss is included in other income, net. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a charge of $40.2 million ($28.2 million, net of tax) for Veda acquisition related amounts. $30.1 million relates to transaction and integration costs in operating income, $9.2 million is recorded in other income and is the impact of foreign currency changes on the transaction structure, including the economic hedges, $0.2 million is recorded in depreciation and amortization, and $0.7 million is recorded in interest expense. Comparable charges for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were $0.5 million ($0.3 million, net of tax) for acquisition specific transaction and due diligence expense. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Accrual for certain legal claims - We recorded a charge of $6.5 million ($5.0 million, net of tax) and $7.5 million ($4.7 million, net of tax) related to an accrual for certain legal claims in the fourth quarter of 2016 and third quarter of 2015, respectively. Management believes excluding these charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, since a charge of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Charge related to the realignment of internal resources and other - We recorded a charge of $5.7 million ($3.7 million, net of tax) and $23.4 million ($14.9 million, net of tax) in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2015, respectively. These charges were predominantly related to the realignment of our internal resources to support our strategic objectives and increase the integration of our global operations. Management believes excluding these charges from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2016, since a charge of such an amount for 2015 is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Income from the settlement of escrow amounts related to a past acquisition - During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded income of $12.3 million ($11.1 million, net of tax) from the settlement of escrow amounts related to an acquisition completed in January 2014. Management believes excluding this income from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, since an income of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

State income tax benefit - During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded an unanticipated state income tax benefit of $8.6 million, due to a change in tax law. Management believes excluding this benefit from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016, because a benefit of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin, excluding Veda acquisition related amounts other than acquisition-related amortization, an accrual for certain legal claims, realignment of internal resources and other costs, income from the settlement of escrow amounts, and impairment of our BVS investment -  Management believes excluding the impact of Veda acquisition related amounts other than acquisition-related amortization, an accrual for certain legal claims, realignment of internal resources and other costs, income from the settlement of escrow amounts, and impairment of BVS investment from the calculation of operating income and operating margin, on a non-GAAP basis, allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management defines adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income attributable to Equifax plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes certain one-time items. Management believes the use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis.
