On February 9, 2017, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.

The Notes are governed by the Indenture, dated as of November 5, 1999 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust National Association, as successor in interest to State Street Bank and Trust Company, as trustee. 

The 2020 Notes mature on February 7, 2020, the 2027 Notes mature on March 15, 2027 and the 2047 Notes mature on March 15, 2047. Interest on the 2020 Notes is payable on February 7 and August 7 of each year, commencing August 7, 2017 and accrues from February 9, 2017. Interest on the 2027 Notes and the 2047 Notes is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing September 15, 2017 and accrues from February 9, 2017. The Company may redeem the Notes of each series, in whole or in part, at its option at any time with respect to the 2020 Notes; and prior to (i) December 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the 2027 Notes) with respect to the 2027 Notes and (ii) September 15, 2046 (six months prior to the maturity date of the 2047 Notes) with respect to the 2047 Notes, in each case, by paying a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, the Company may redeem the 2027 Notes and 2047 Notes, as applicable, in whole or in part, at its option at any time on or after December 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the 2027 Notes) with respect to the 2027 Notes, and September 15, 2046 (six months prior to the maturity date of the 2047 Notes) with respect to the 2047 Notes, in each case, at 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes or 2047 Notes, as applicable, to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with all of its other senior unsecured indebtedness. 

The Notes are subject to certain customary covenants, including limitations on the Company’s ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets; limitations on the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to secure indebtedness with liens; and limitations on sale and leaseback transactions by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event (as described in the officers’ certificates setting forth the terms of the 2020 Notes, 2027 Notes and 2047 Notes (each, an “Officers’ Certificate”)), the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount.
