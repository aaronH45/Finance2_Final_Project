NEW YORK, February 8, 2017 – Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2016.  

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bewkes said: “We had another very successful year in 2016, demonstrating once more Time Warner’s ability to deliver strong financial performance alongside creative and programming excellence. All our operating divisions increased revenue and profits while also making investments to capitalize on the growing demand for the very best video content and new ways to deliver it to audiences around the world. Warner Bros. is once again the #1 supplier of television shows for the broadcast networks, and had its second-best year ever at the global box office, nearing $5 billion in receipts with such hits as Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.”  

Mr. Bewkes continued: “Home Box Office again stood apart with its combination of the biggest Hollywood hit movies and best original programming — receiving more Primetime Emmy Awards in 2016 than any other network for the 15th consecutive year and launching Westworld, which is produced by Warner Bros. and is the most-watched new series in HBO’s history. We’re also really pleased with the growth of HBO’s domestic OTT product, and we expanded HBO’s international OTT footprint with launches in Spain, Brazil and Argentina in 2016. Turner continued to strengthen its leadership with TBS, TNT and Adult Swim all ranking among ad-supported cable’s top five networks in primetime among adults 18-49 for the year. TBS was the #1 ad-supported entertainment cable network on the strength of great sports and a bold new lineup of originals, including Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, and CNN was the #1 news network among adults 18-49 in primetime and the #1 digital news destination in 2016. The deal to be acquired by AT&T Inc., which we announced in October 2016, will accelerate our efforts to spur innovation in the media industry and further strengthen our businesses. We remain on track to close the transaction later this year.”  

Full-Year Company Results  

Full-year revenues increased 4% to $29.3 billion due to increases at all operating divisions and lower intersegment eliminations, and included the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $340 million in the year.

Adjusted EPS in the current year excludes $1.0 billion of premiums paid and costs incurred in connection with debt repurchases.  

In 2016, Cash Provided by Operations from Continuing Operations reached $4.7 billion and Free Cash Flow totaled $4.4 billion.

TURNER  

Full-Year Results  

Revenues increased 7% ($768 million) to $11.4 billion, benefiting from increases of 12% ($630 million) in Subscription revenues and 3% ($126 million) in Advertising revenues. The increase in Subscription revenues was due to higher domestic rates and growth at Turner’s international networks, partially offset by the impact of lower domestic subscribers and foreign exchange rates. Advertising revenues benefited from domestic growth and local currency growth at Turner’s international networks, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates. Domestic advertising revenues grew primarily due to Turner’s news business and sports business, including the 2016 NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball National Championship game, partially offset by lower delivery at certain entertainment networks.  

Operating Income increased 7% ($285 million) to $4.4 billion due to the increase in revenues partially offset by higher expenses, including increased programming and marketing costs. Programming costs grew 5% primarily due to higher sports costs and increases at Turner’s news business related to its coverage of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. The increase in marketing costs was primarily associated with new original series related to the TBS and TNT rebrands.  

Adjusted Operating Income increased 8% ($316 million) to $4.4 billion. Adjusted Operating Income for the current year excludes a $25 million asset impairment.  

In 2016, among adults 18-49 in primetime: TBS, TNT and Adult Swim ranked among ad-supported cable’s top 5 networks; TBS was the #1 ad-supported entertainment cable network; and CNN was the #1 news network and was the fastest growing top 30 cable network in the U.S. In 2016, CNN was also the #1 digital news destination. In March 2016, Turner and CBS entered into an agreement with the NCAA to extend their television, digital and marketing rights to the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship Tournament through 2032. Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Western Conference Finals on TNT was the most-viewed NBA telecast of all time on cable and TNT’s most watched program ever with an average of nearly 16 million viewers.  

Fourth-Quarter Results  

Revenues increased 7% ($177 million) to $2.8 billion, due to an increase of 14% ($182 million) in Subscription revenues and 9% ($14 million) in Content and other revenues, partially offset by a decrease of 2% ($19 million) in Advertising revenues. Subscription revenues benefited from higher domestic rates and growth at Turner’s international networks, partially offset by the impact of lower domestic subscribers. Content and other revenues increased primarily due to higher licensing revenues. Advertising revenues decreased due to declines at Turner’s international networks, partially due to foreign exchange rates. Domestic advertising was flat with growth at Turner’s news business offset by lower delivery at certain entertainment networks and lower revenues associated with the MLB postseason games.  

Operating Income increased 8% ($64 million) to $841 million, reflecting revenue growth partially offset by higher expenses, including increased marketing costs primarily due to new original series. Programming expenses were essentially flat.  

Adjusted Operating Income increased 9% ($70 million) to $851 million.  

HOME BOX OFFICE  

Full-Year Results  

Revenues increased 5% ($275 million) to $5.9 billion, due to increases of 5% ($255 million) in Subscription revenues and 2% ($20 million) in Content and other revenues. Subscription revenues grew primarily due to higher domestic rates and international growth. The increase in Content and other revenues primarily reflects higher international licensing revenues, partially offset by lower domestic licensing revenues.  

Operating Income increased 2% ($39 million) to $1.9 billion, reflecting higher revenues partially offset by increased expenses, including higher programming and restructuring and severance costs. Programming costs grew 7%, primarily reflecting increased original programming costs, partially offset by a reduction in amortization resulting from a longer estimated utilization period for original programming.  

4  

Adjusted Operating Income grew 3% ($50 million) to $1.9 billion.  

HBO received 22 Primetime Emmy Awards in 2016, the most of any network for the 15th consecutive year, including Outstanding Drama Series for Game of Thrones, Outstanding Comedy Series for Veep and Outstanding Variety Talk Series for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. Game of Thrones received 12 awards and is the most awarded scripted show ever with a cumulative 38 Primetime Emmy Awards. In addition, the sixth season of Game of Thrones averaged close to 26 million viewers, making it HBO’s most-watched series ever. The first season of Westworld averaged over 13 million viewers and is the most watched freshman series in HBO history. In 2016, HBO launched OTT products on Microsoft’s Xbox platforms, new Samsung smart TVs, Sony’s PlayStation platforms and Amazon Prime Channels. In 2016, HBO also launched an OTT service in Spain and HBO Latin America launched OTT services in Brazil and Argentina.  

Fourth-Quarter Results  

Revenues increased 6% ($79 million) to $1.5 billion, due to increases of 5% ($64 million) in Subscription revenues and 7% ($15 million) in Content and other revenues. Subscription revenues increased due to higher domestic rates and international growth. The increase in Content and other revenues primarily reflects higher home entertainment revenues, partially offset by lower international licensing revenues.  

Operating Income increased 9% ($36 million) to $429 million, due to the increase in revenues partially offset by higher expenses, including increased distribution expenses related to the timing of home video releases. Programming expenses decreased 2% mainly due to lower programming charges, partially offset by increased original programming costs.  

Adjusted Operating Income increased 10% ($38 million) to $431 million.  

WARNER BROS.  

Full-Year Results  

Revenues were essentially flat at $13.0 billion, reflecting higher theatrical and television revenues offset by lower videogames revenues and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Theatrical revenues increased primarily due to the box office releases of Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Television revenues grew primarily due to increased production. Videogames revenues declined as the prior year benefited from the releases of Mortal Kombat X and Batman: Arkham Knight.  

Operating Income increased 22% ($318 million) to $1.7 billion as increased theatrical contributions and a $90 million gain on the April 2016 sale of Flixster more than offset the impact from lower videogames revenues.  

Adjusted Operating Income increased 16% ($227 million) to $1.7 billion. Adjusted Operating Income for the current year excludes the gain on the sale of Flixster.  

Warner Bros. is producing 75 series for the 2016-2017 television season, including 36 primetime series on broadcast networks, the most of any studio for the 8th season in a row. Season-to-date, among adults 18-49, The Big Bang Theory is the #1 show and The Voice and The Bachelor are the #1 and #2 unscripted series, respectively. At the global box office, Warner Bros. was the #2 studio in 2016 and grossed nearly $5.0 billion in box office receipts, its second-best worldwide theatrical performance.  

Fourth-Quarter Results  

Revenues increased 17% ($563 million) to $3.9 billion mainly due to higher theatrical revenues, which benefited from the releases of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and The Accountant, and higher television revenues, primarily due to higher licensing revenues and increased production.  

Operating Income increased 57% ($208 million) to $574 million primarily due to the increase in revenues, partially offset by higher associated costs of revenues.  

5  

Adjusted Operating Income increased 57% ($213 million) to $586 million.  

CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME AND PER SHARE RESULTS  

Full-Year Results  

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. shareholders of $3.9 billion and EPS of $4.94. This compares to Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner common shareholders in 2015 of $3.8 billion and EPS of $4.58. The increase in EPS primarily reflects higher Operating Income, a lower effective tax rate primarily due to the benefit from an IRS-approved tax accounting method change and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by premiums paid and costs incurred in connection with debt repurchases.  

Adjusted EPS was $5.86 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $4.75 in 2015. Adjusted EPS in the current year excludes $1.0 billion of premiums paid and costs incurred in connection with debt repurchases.  

For 2016 and 2015, the Company had Net Income attributable to Time Warner Inc. shareholders of $3.9 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively.  

Fourth-Quarter Results  

For the three months ended December 31, 2016, the Company had Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. shareholders of $317 million and EPS of $0.40 per diluted common share. This compares to Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2015 of $857 million, or $1.06 per diluted common share. The decrease in EPS reflects premiums paid and costs incurred in connection with debt repurchases in the current year quarter, partially offset by higher Operating Income and fewer shares outstanding.  

Adjusted EPS was $1.25 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.06 in last year’s fourth quarter. Adjusted EPS in the current year quarter excludes $1.0 billion of premiums and costs incurred in connection with debt repurchases.  

For the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, the Company had Net Income attributable to Time Warner Inc. shareholders of $293 million and $857 million, respectively.  

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The Company utilizes Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Operating Income margin and Adjusted EPS, among other measures, to evaluate the performance of its businesses. These measures are considered important indicators of the operational strength of the Company’s businesses. Some limitations of Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Operating Income margin and Adjusted EPS are that they do not reflect certain charges that affect the operating results of the Company’s businesses and they involve judgment as to whether items affect fundamental operating performance.  

Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) is Operating Income (Loss) excluding the impact of noncash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets; gains and losses on operating assets (other than deferred gains on sale-leasebacks); gains and losses recognized in connection with pension and other postretirement benefit plan curtailments or settlements; external costs related to mergers, acquisitions or dispositions (including restructuring and severance costs associated with dispositions), as well as contingent consideration related to such transactions, to the extent such costs are expensed; amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations; and the foreign currency losses during the three months ended December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015, related to the translation of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency resulting from the Company’s change to the SICAD 2 exchange rate beginning December 31, 2014 and the Simadi exchange rate during the quarter ended March 31, 2015, respectively. Adjusted Operating Income margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income divided by Revenues.  

Beginning with periods ending on or after October 1, 2016, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) is defined as Operating Income (Loss) excluding the impact of noncash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets; gains and losses on operating assets (other than deferred gains on sale-leasebacks); gains and losses recognized in connection with pension and other postretirement benefit plan curtailments or settlements; costs related to the pending acquisition by AT&T Inc. (including retention, restructuring and severance costs associated with the transaction); external costs  

6  

 related to mergers, acquisitions or dispositions (including restructuring and severance costs associated with dispositions), as well as contingent consideration related to such transactions, to the extent such costs are expensed; amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations; and the foreign currency losses during the three months ended December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 related to the translation of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency resulting from the Company’s change to the SICAD 2 exchange rate beginning December 31, 2014 and the Simadi exchange rate during the quarter ended March 31, 2015, respectively.  

Adjusted EPS is Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. common shareholders with the following items excluded from Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. common shareholders: noncash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets and investments; gains and losses on operating assets (other than deferred gains on sale-leasebacks), liabilities (including extinguishments of debt) and investments, in each case including associated costs of the transaction; gains and losses recognized in connection with pension and other postretirement benefit plan curtailments or settlements; external costs related to mergers, acquisitions, investments or dispositions (including restructuring and severance costs associated with dispositions), as well as contingent consideration related to such transactions, to the extent such costs are expensed; amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations; the foreign currency losses during the three months ended December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 related to the translation of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency resulting from the Company’s change to the SICAD 2 exchange rate beginning December 31, 2014 and the Simadi exchange rate during the quarter ended March 31, 2015, respectively; and amounts attributable to businesses classified as discontinued operations; as well as the impact of taxes and noncontrolling interests on the above items and the Company’s share of the above items with respect to equity method investments. Adjusted EPS is considered an important indicator of the operational strength of the Company’s businesses as this measure eliminates amounts that do not reflect the fundamental performance of the Company’s businesses. The Company utilizes Adjusted EPS, among other measures, to evaluate the performance of its businesses both on an absolute basis and relative to its peers and the broader market. Many investors also use an adjusted EPS measure as a common basis for comparing the performance of different companies.  

Beginning with periods ending on or after October 1, 2016, Adjusted EPS is Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. common shareholders with the following items excluded from Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. common shareholders: noncash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets and investments; gains and losses on operating assets (other than deferred gains on sale-leasebacks), liabilities (including extinguishments of debt) and investments, in each case including associated costs of the transaction; gains and losses recognized in connection with pension and other postretirement benefit plan curtailments or settlements; costs related to the pending acquisition by AT&T Inc. (including retention, restructuring and severance costs associated with the transaction); external costs related to mergers, acquisitions, investments or dispositions (including restructuring and severance costs associated with dispositions), as well as contingent consideration related to such transactions, to the extent such costs are expensed; amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations; the foreign currency losses during the three months ended December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 related to the translation of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency resulting from the Company’s change to the SICAD 2 exchange rate beginning December 31, 2014 and the Simadi exchange rate during the quarter ended March 31, 2015, respectively; and amounts attributable to businesses classified as discontinued operations; as well as the impact of taxes and noncontrolling interests on the above items and the Company’s share of the above items with respect to equity method investments.  

Free Cash Flow is defined as Cash Provided by Operations from Continuing Operations plus payments related to securities litigation and government investigations (net of any insurance recoveries), external costs related to mergers, acquisitions, investments or dispositions (including restructuring and severance costs associated with dispositions), to the extent such costs are expensed, contingent consideration payments made in connection with acquisitions, and excess tax benefits from equity instruments, less capital expenditures, principal payments on capital leases and partnership distributions, if any. The Company uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate the performance and liquidity of its businesses and considers Free Cash Flow when making decisions regarding strategic investments, dividends and share repurchases. The Company believes Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors because it is an important indicator of the Company’s liquidity, including its ability to reduce net debt, make strategic investments, pay dividends to common shareholders and repurchase stock.  

7  

A general limitation of these measures is that they are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation and excluded items. Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the Company’s Operating Income (Loss), Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations and various cash flow measures (e.g., Cash Provided by Operations from Continuing Operations), as well as other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
