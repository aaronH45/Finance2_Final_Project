Item 8.01—Other Events.  

On January 18, 2017, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) dated as of July 23, 2015, among Anthem, Inc. (the “Company”), Anthem Merger Sub Corp. and Cigna Corporation (“Cigna”), the Company delivered written notice to Cigna that Anthem has elected to extend the “Termination Date” (as defined in the Merger Agreement) through and including April 30, 2017.  

Anthem’s election to extend the Termination Date is based on its determination that additional time will be needed to consummate the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement, regardless of the outcome of the District Court’s proceeding in United States, et al. v. Anthem, Inc. and Cigna Corp.  

The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report filed by Anthem on July 27, 2015, and which is incorporated herein by reference.
