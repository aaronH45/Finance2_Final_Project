PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Q4 2016 vs. Q3 2016 

▪The increase in the provision for income taxes compared to the prior quarter was based primarily on increased income before income taxes.

In the current quarter, the ASU 2016-09 income tax benefit driven by increased stock options exercised was offset by an adjustment to correct a portion of the income tax benefit recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 upon adoption of ASU 2016-09.

SUMMARY RESULTS & KEY METRICS

(*) Total revenue presented on an FTE basis is a non-generally accepted accounting principle financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. Please refer to the Reconciliation to Fully Taxable Equivalent section for further detail.

Net income per diluted common share for the full year was $4.32, compared to $3.99 in the prior year. Net income for 2016 totaled $1.03 billion, up $58.7 million, or 6%, from $973.8 million in 2015. The performance in 2016 generated a return on average common equity of 11.9%, compared to 11.5% in 2015. 

The current-year second quarter revenue included a pre-tax gain on the sale of 1.1 million Visa Inc. Class B common shares, net of the valuation adjustment to existing swap agreements, totaling $118.2 million, partially offset by impairment charges associated with our leasing portfolio of $21.6 million. Additionally, the current-year second quarter noninterest expense included charges relating to certain securities lending litigation of $46.5 million, contractual modifications associated with certain existing asset servicing clients of $18.6 million, and severance and other personnel related charges of $17.5 million. 

The prior-year second quarter included a pre-tax gain on the sale of 1.0 million Visa Inc. Class B common shares totaling $99.9 million, voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar net-asset-value (NAV) funds of $45.8 million and the impairment of the residual value of certain aircraft under leveraged lease agreements of $17.8 million.

FULL YEAR 2016 RESULTS VS. FULL YEAR 2015 (continued)

Net interest income on an FTE basis in 2016 totaled $1.26 billion, an increase of $164.6 million, or 15%, from $1.10 billion in 2015, due to higher levels of average earning assets and an increased net interest margin. The net interest margin increased to 1.18% in 2016 from 1.07% in 2015 due to higher yields on earning assets. The current-year and prior-year net interest margin reflect the impact of a $2.7 million and a $17.8 million impairment of the residual value of certain assets under leveraged lease agreements, respectively. Excluding the impairments, net interest margin was 1.18% and 1.09% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Noninterest expense totaled $3.47 billion in 2016, up $190.1 million, or 6%, from $3.28 billion in the prior year. The current-year second quarter noninterest expense included charges relating to certain securities lending litigation of $46.5 million, contractual modifications associated with certain existing asset servicing clients of $18.6 million, and severance and other personnel related charges of $17.5 million. The prior-year second quarter included a $45.8 million charge related to voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar NAV funds. Excluding the charges, noninterest expense increased $153.3 million, or 5%, primarily attributable to increased compensation, outside services, and equipment and software expense. 

The provision for credit losses in 2016 was a credit of $26.0 million, reflecting improved credit quality across the portfolio coupled with an update to the underlying data used in the quantitative portion of the inherent allowance for credit losses that resulted in a reduction in the allowance ascribed to the residential real estate and private client portfolios. The provision for credit losses in 2015 was a credit of $43.0 million, which reflected improved credit quality across the portfolio coupled with the adoption of a change in estimation methodology for inherent losses. The change in estimate resulted in a decrease in the estimate for the allowance for credit losses for the commercial and institutional loan portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit.

The provision for income taxes in 2016 totaled $484.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 31.9%. The provision for income taxes in 2015 totaled $491.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 33.5%. The current year includes a $12.3 million income tax benefit attributed to the Corporation adopting ASU 2016-09, an increase in federal tax-exempt income and change in the earnings mix in tax jurisdictions in which the Corporation operates, each of which resulted in a reduction of the effective tax rate.

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Total stockholders’ equity averaged $9.6 billion, up $915.8 million, or 11% from the prior-year quarter’s average of $8.7 billion.

During the year, the Corporation issued and sold 500,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of Series D Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock for proceeds of $493.5 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other issuance costs.

RECONCILIATION TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT

The following table presents a reconciliation of interest income, net interest income, net interest margin, and total revenue prepared in accordance with GAAP to such measures on an FTE basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this presentation provides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.
