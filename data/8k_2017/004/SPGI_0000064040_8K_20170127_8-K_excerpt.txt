Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

As previously announced, effective beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, S&P Global Inc. (the “Company”) realigned certain of its reportable segments to be consistent with changes to its organizational structure and how the Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of these segments. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Platts are included in a new reportable segment named Market and Commodities Intelligence. This change in organizational structure did not impact the other reportable segments of the Company. 

To assist in the analysis of the Company’s new reportable segment structure, the Company has recast operating results for the three quarters and first nine months of 2016 and each of the four quarters and full year of 2015 in Exhibit 99 to this Form 8-K.

The information furnished pursuant to this Item 7.01 shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in this Form 8-K shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing or document.
