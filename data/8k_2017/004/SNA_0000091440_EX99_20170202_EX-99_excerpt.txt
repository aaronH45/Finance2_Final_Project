In 2017, we expect to make continued progress through our Snap-on Value Creation Processes and, at the same time, advance further along each of our strategic runways for growth: enhance the franchise network, expand with repair shop owners and managers, extend in critical industries and build in emerging markets. As always, I thank our franchisees and associates for their significant contributions to our team. Without their dedication, capability and commitment, the encouraging results of the fourth quarter and the continuing positive trends of the year would not have been possible.”

 Outlook  

 Snap-on expects to make continued progress in 2017 along its defined runways for coherent growth, leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base, not only in automotive repair, but in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including extending in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. In pursuit of these initiatives, Snap-on expects that capital expenditures in 2017 will be in a range of $80 million to $90 million.

 Non-GAAP Measures  

 References in this document to “organic sales” refer to sales from continuing operations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), excluding acquisition-related sales and the impact of foreign currency translation. Management evaluates the company’s sales performance based on organic sales growth, which primarily reflects growth from the company’s existing businesses as a result of increased output, customer base and geographic expansion, new product development and/or pricing, and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prior-year reporting period. The company’s organic sales disclosures also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in our businesses and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with prior periods.
