In November, Charter continued introducing its Spectrum brand, and residential pricing and packaging in additional Legacy TWC markets, including New York City, as well as in all Legacy Bright House markets. Spectrum is an industry-leading suite of video, Internet, and voice services that includes over 200 HD channels, minimum offered Internet speeds of at least 60 Mbps, and a fully featured voice service, delivered at a highly competitive price. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, 94% of Legacy Charter's residential customers received Charter Spectrum products. Charter will complete the launch of Spectrum to residences in the majority of remaining Legacy TWC markets in the first quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter, Spectrum Enterprise launched new pricing and packaging to the enterprise marketplace, and during the second quarter of 2017, Charter will launch Spectrum pricing and packaging for small and medium businesses in Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets.

In the second quarter of 2017, Charter will also restart all-digital efforts in the approximately 40% of Legacy TWC's footprint and 60% of Legacy Bright House's footprint that are not yet all-digital. All-digital allows Charter to offer more advanced products and services, and provides residential customers with two-way digital set-tops, which offer better picture quality, an interactive programming guide and video on demand on all TV outlets in the home. Charter intends to complete the all-digital conversion in Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets in less than 2 years, with a minimum Internet speed offering of 100 Mbps in many markets. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, Legacy Charter's footprint was 100% all-digital.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, Charter's residential customer relationships grew by 250,000, versus 359,000 in the prior year period.1 Residential PSUs increased by 345,000 versus a gain of 917,000 in the prior year period. The year-over-year decline in customer relationship and PSU net additions was primarily the result of elevated churn from Legacy TWC historical pricing and packaging. As of December 31, 2016, Charter had 24.8 million residential customer relationships and 48.5 million residential PSUs.

Residential video customers decreased by 51,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016, versus an increase of 118,000 in the year-ago period, driven primarily by higher year-over-year video losses at Legacy TWC. Over the last twelve months, Legacy Charter grew residential video customers by 42,000 or 1.0%. As of December 31, 2016, Charter had 16.8 million residential video customers.

Charter added 357,000 residential Internet customers in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 495,000 a year ago. As of December 31, 2016, over 90% of Legacy Charter's residential Internet customers subscribed to tiers that provided speeds of 60 Mbps or more compared to 36% at Legacy TWC and 71% at Legacy Bright House. The Company continues to see strong demand for its Internet service as consumers value the speed and reliability of Charter's Internet offering. As of December 31, 2016, Charter had 21.4 million residential Internet customers.

During the fourth quarter, the Company added 39,000 residential voice customers, versus 304,000 during the fourth quarter of 2015. The year-over-year decline in voice net additions was primarily driven by a Legacy TWC voice promotion that drove voice net additions in the fourth quarter of 2015. As of December 31, 2016, Charter had 10.3 million residential voice customers.

Fourth quarter residential revenue per customer relationship was $109.77, and grew by 1.4% as compared to the prior year period, driven by promotional rate step-ups and rate adjustments, partially offset by continued single play Internet sell-in.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, SMB customer relationships grew by 37,000, versus customer growth of 35,000 during the fourth quarter of 2015. SMB PSUs increased 73,000, compared to 64,000 during the fourth quarter of 2015. As of December 31, 2016, Charter had 1.4 million SMB customer relationships and 2.4 million SMB PSUs.

1All customer data referred to herein for periods prior to the third quarter of 2016, are pro forma for the Transactions as if they had closed at the beginning of the earliest period presented.

UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND OPERATING DATA

(dollars in millions, except per share data) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenue

On a pro forma basis, fourth quarter revenues rose 7.2% year-over-year to $10.3 billion, driven primarily by growth in Internet, commercial, advertising and video revenues. On an actual basis, fourth quarter revenue increased 309.0% year-over-year, driven by the Transactions.

Video revenues totaled $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.9% on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period. Pro forma video revenue growth was driven by annual and promotional rate adjustments and higher advanced services penetration. On an actual basis, fourth quarter video revenues increased by 251.2% compared to the prior year period, driven by the Transactions.

On a pro forma basis, Internet revenues grew 13.3%, compared to the year-ago quarter, to $3.3 billion, driven by an increase of 1,463,000 Internet customers during the last year, promotional rolloff and price adjustments. On an actual basis, Internet revenues grew 324.2% year-over-year, as a result of the Transactions.

Voice revenues totaled $719 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 0.5% on a pro forma basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, as promotions and value-based pricing more than offset the addition of 368,000 voice customers over the last twelve months. Voice revenues increased 431.6% year-over-year, on an actual basis, driven by the Transactions.

5

Commercial revenues rose to $1.4 billion, an increase of 11.8% on a pro forma basis over the prior year period, driven by SMB revenue growth of 13.0% and enterprise revenue growth of 9.8%. On an actual basis, commercial revenues grew 382.1% year-over-year, as a result of the Transactions. 

Fourth quarter advertising sales revenues of $506 million increased 20.8% on a pro forma basis compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by an increase in political advertising revenue. Advertising sales grew 482.9% year-over-year, on an actual basis, driven by the Transactions.

Operating Costs and Expenses

On a pro forma basis, fourth quarter total operating costs and expenses increased by $259 million, or 4.2%, compared to the year-ago period, primarily driven by increases in programming and other expenses. On an actual basis, total operating costs and expenses grew by 300.4% year-over-year as a result of the Transactions. 

Fourth quarter programming expense increased by $137 million, or 6.1% on a pro forma basis, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting contractual programming increases, partly offset by Transactions synergies.

Costs to service customers increased by $19 million or 1.0% on a pro forma basis year-over-year, despite year-over-year residential and SMB customer relationship growth of 4.6%, as a result of less all-digital activity at Legacy TWC, lower service transaction volume per customer and lower churn at Legacy Charter. 

Marketing expenses decreased by $32 million, or 5.5% year-over-year, on a pro forma basis, due to efficiencies from the consolidation of marketing strategies following the Transactions. Other expenses grew by $61 million, or 6.1% on a pro forma basis, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting higher advertising sales costs associated with increased political advertising and higher enterprise sales and labor costs, partly offset by Transactions synergies.

Adjusted EBITDA

Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $3.9 billion grew by 12.7% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, reflecting revenue growth and operating expense growth of 7.2% and 4.2%, respectively. Excluding transition costs of $78 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $22 million in the prior year period, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA grew by 14.3% year-over-year. On an actual basis, Adjusted EBITDA grew by 324.3% year-over-year, due to the Transactions.

Net Income Attributable to Charter Shareholders

Net income attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $454 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to pro forma net income of $130 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The year-over-year increase in pro forma net income was primarily related to higher Adjusted EBITDA, a pension revaluation gain, and a gain on financial instruments driven by the foreign currency remeasurement of Legacy TWC’s British pound debt and revaluation of related currency swaps, partly offset by higher severance-related and transaction expenses, higher income tax expense and higher depreciation and amortization. Net income per basic common share attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $1.69 in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $0.48, on a pro forma basis, during the same period last year. The increase was primarily the result of the factors described above, as well as a 0.5% decrease in pro forma weighted average shares outstanding versus the prior year period.

On an actual basis, net income attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $454 million during the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to a net loss of $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in net income was primarily related to higher income from operations as a result of the Transactions. Actual 

6

net income per basic common share attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $1.69 in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss per basic common share of $1.21 during the same period last year. The increase was driven by the Transactions, partly offset by a 165.0% increase in weighted average shares outstanding versus the prior year period, also a result of the Transactions.

Capital Expenditures

Property, plant and equipment expenditures totaled $1.888 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $1.831 billion, on a pro forma basis, during the fourth quarter of 2015. The pro forma year-over-year increase in capital expenditures was driven by an increase in CPE spending primarily due to higher customer connect volumes for markets where Spectrum pricing and packaging was recently launched and transition capital expenditures incurred in connection with the Transactions. Transition capital expenditures accounted for $187 million of capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding transition-related expenditures, fourth quarter 2016 capital expenditures totaled $1.701 billion, compared to $1.782 billion, on a pro forma basis, during the same period last year.

On an actual basis, fourth quarter 2016 capital expenditures increased by $1.3 billion as compared to the prior year, due to the Transactions.

Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow

During the fourth quarter of 2016, net cash flows from operating activities totaled $3.2 billion, compared to $611 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The year-over-year increase in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to higher Adjusted EBITDA and a working capital benefit, partly offset by higher cash paid for interest in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the fourth quarter of 2015, following the close of the Transactions.

Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2016 totaled $1.9 billion, compared to $80 million during the same period last year. The increase was related to higher net cash flows from operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the fourth quarter of 2015, given the close of the Transactions, partly offset by higher capital expenditures.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenue

For the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues rose to $40.0 billion on a pro forma basis, 7.0% higher than in 2015, driven by continued growth in Internet, commercial, and video revenues, along with higher advertising from increased political revenue.

Operating Costs and Expenses

Net Income Attributable to Charter Shareholders

On a pro forma basis, net income attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $159 million in 2015. The year-over-year increase in pro forma net income was primarily related to higher Adjusted EBITDA.

On an actual basis, net income attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $271 million in 2015. The increase in net income was driven by the Transactions, including a $3.3 billion tax benefit resulting from a reduction in Legacy Charter's preexisting valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and higher income from operations, partly offset by higher interest expense, also a result of the Transactions. Actual net income per basic common share attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $17.05 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a net loss per basic common share of $2.68 during the same period last year. The increase was driven by the Transactions, partly offset by a 104% increase in weighted average shares outstanding versus the prior year period, also a result of the Transactions.

Capital Expenditures

Pro forma capital expenditures totaled $7.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $7.0 billion in 2015. The increase was primarily the result of higher spending on scalable infrastructure, CPE, support and transition related capital. Transition related capital expenditures accounted for $460 million and $115 million of capital expenditures in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding transition-related expenses, pro forma capital expenditures totaled $7.1 billion in 2016 versus in $6.9 billion 2015.

Cash Flow & Free Cash Flow

In 2016, net cash flows from operating activities totaled $8.0 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in 2015. The year-over-year increase in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to higher Adjusted EBITDA and a working capital benefit, partly offset by higher cash paid for interest, following the close of the Transactions.

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3.3 billion, compared to $547 million during the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to higher cash flow from operating activities, partly offset by higher capital expenditures, following the close of the Transactions.

Liquidity & Financing

As of December 31, 2016, total principal amount of debt was $60.0 billion and Charter's credit facilities provided approximately $2.8 billion of additional liquidity in excess of Charter's $1.5 billion cash position.

Additional Information Available on Website

The information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, which will be posted on the “Financial Information” section of our investor relations website at ir.charter.com, when it is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). A slide presentation to accompany the conference call and a trending schedule containing historical customer and financial data will also be available in the “Financial Information” section.

Use of Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Pro Forma Information

The company uses certain measures that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") to evaluate various aspects of its business. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, consolidated net income (loss) and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. These terms, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are reconciled to consolidated net income (loss) and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, in the Addendum to this release.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, other pension benefits, special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of the Company's businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by the Company's capital structure or investment activities. However, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and the cash cost of financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures.  

Free cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.

Management and Charter's board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to assess Charter's performance and its ability to service its debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under the Company's credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the the SEC). For the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, the Company uses Adjusted 

11

EBITDA, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by its operating subsidiaries to other Charter entities. The Company's debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which were $296 million and $91 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $930 million and $322 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Pro forma results give effect to the Transactions as if they had closed at the beginning of the earliest period presented and include the operations of Legacy Charter, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House for the full year ended December 31, 2016 and three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Due to the transformative nature of the Transactions, the Company believes that providing a discussion of its results of operations on a pro forma basis provides management and investors a more meaningful perspective on the Company's financial and operational performance and trends. The results of operations data on a pro forma basis are provided for illustrative purposes only and are based on available information and assumptions that Charter believes are reasonable and do not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations of Charter would have been had the Transactions occurred as of the beginning of the earliest period presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position. Exhibit 99.1 in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 filed with the SEC on November 3, 2016 provides pro forma financial information for each quarter of 2015 and the first and second quarters of 2016 and a reconciliation of the pro forma financial information to the actual results of operations of the Company.

(a)All customer statistics include the operations of Legacy TWC, Legacy Bright House and Legacy Charter each of which is based on individual legacy company reporting methodology.
