Operating Results - year ended December 31, 2016

This section discusses the company's full year 2016 results, as compared to 2015, and comments on significant items that have impacted the company's results as presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Operating revenues decreased $388.5 million (7.6%) to $4,734.4 million in 2016, from $5,122.9 million in 2015, primarily due to decreased investment management fees. Investment management fees decreased by $288.0 million (7.1%) to $3,773.1 million in 2016, from $4,061.1 million in 2015 due to lower average AUM along with the impact of changes in the AUM product and currency mix. Foreign exchange rate changes decreased operating revenues by $136.8 million compared to 2015. The average Pound Sterling exchange rate for 2016 was 1.3556 compared to 1.5282 for 2015, an 11.3% decline. Performance fees decreased $41.6 million (48.4%) to $44.3 million in 2016 from $85.9 million in 2015. 

Operating expenses decreased $206.5 million (5.5%) to $3,558.0 million in 2016, from $3,764.5 million in 2015. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses comprise $172.7 million of the decrease consistent with the related revenue decline. Foreign exchange rate changes decreased 2016 operating expenses by $83.2 million when compared to 2015. Business optimization charges increased to $49.9 million in 2016, compared to $16.2 million in 2015. As of the end of 2016, this initiative has produced annualized run-rate expense savings of $20.8 million. These savings have helped offset acquisition-related increases in operating expenses.

Non-operating income and expense includes a decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $25.8 million from $35.1 million in 2015 to $9.3 million in 2016. The decrease in equity in earnings includes the $17.8 million impairment charge on our Indian asset management joint venture in the first quarter of 2016 related to the weakening of the Indian Rupee against the U.S. Dollar, prior to the company's acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the joint venture. Interest expense increased in 2016 to $93.4 million from $81.7 million in 2015, related to the senior note issuance in late 2015. Other gains and losses, net was a gain of $22.9 million in 2016 compared to a loss of $1.5 million in 2015. 2016 includes net gains of $22.0 million related to foreign currency hedges, as compared to losses of $7.7 million in 2015. The capital management discussion below includes details of our foreign currency hedges. Also included in non-operating income is other income of CIP, net of $79.2 million in 2016 as compared to $27.1 million in 2015.

Property, office and technology expenses increased $7.1 million (9.1%) to $85.3 million in the fourth quarter, from $78.2 million in the third quarter 2016.

Further details of these foreign exchange hedge contracts are given below in the capital management section.

The effective tax rate increased to 29.9% for the fourth quarter from 26.0% for the third quarter 2016. The impact of the inclusion of noncontrolling interests in CIP increased our effective tax rate by 0.8% for the fourth quarter, compared to a decrease of 1.1% for the third quarter 2016.

Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliations

We are presenting the following non-GAAP performance measures: net revenues (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM), adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd., and adjusted diluted EPS. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency into our business on an ongoing operations basis and allow more appropriate comparisons with industry peers. Management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business and for internal management reporting. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on AUM), operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Invesco Ltd., and diluted EPS. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

The following are reconciliations between the presented non-GAAP measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. These measures are described more fully in the company's Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Refer to these public filings for additional information about the company's non-GAAP performance measures. In addition, a reconciliation of adjusted operating expenses is provided below, together with reconciliations of the U.S. GAAP operating expense lines to provide further analysis of the non-GAAP adjustments.

Footnotes to the Assets Under Management Tables

(a) Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding China joint venture (JV) AUM. For quarterly AUM, our share of the average AUM in the fourth quarter for our JVs in China was $10.1 billion (third quarter 2016: $10.4 billion; fourth quarter 2015: $6.6 billion). For year-to-date AUM, our share of the average AUM in the twelve months of 2016 for our JVs in China was $9.2 billion (twelve months of 2015: $6.1 billion). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our China JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the net income of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, is not considered a meaningful effective fee rate measure. The numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from CIP; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM. 

(b) Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM. See the reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Information on pages 9 through 11 of this release for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.

(c) The alternatives asset class includes absolute return, commodities, currencies, financial structures, global macro, long/short equity, managed futures, multi-alternatives, private capital - direct, private capital - fund of funds, private direct real estate, public real estate securities, senior secured loans and custom solutions. 

(d) Long-term AUM excludes institutional money market AUM and PowerShares QQQ AUM. Ending AUM as of December 31, 2016 includes $70.9 billion in institutional money market AUM and $42.0 billion in PowerShares QQQ AUM (September 30, 2016: $69.2 billion and $39.5 billion, respectively; December 31, 2015: $58.5 billion and $42.9 billion, respectively). Ending retail money market AUM as of December 31, 2016, included in long-term AUM, were $7.4 billion (September 30, 2016: $8.0 billion; December 31, 2015: $6.1 billion).

(e) Passive AUM includes ETFs, UITs, non-fee earning leverage and other passive mandates. Active AUM are total AUM less Passive AUM.

Investment Capabilities Performance Overview

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note:AUM measured in the one-, three-, and five-year peer group rankings represents 58%, 57%, and 55% of total Invesco AUM, respectively, and AUM measured versus benchmark on a one-, three-, and five-year basis represents 70%, 68%, and 64% of total Invesco AUM, respectively, as of 12/31/2016. Peer group rankings are sourced from a widely-used third party ranking agency in each fund's market (Lipper, Morningstar, IA, Russell, Mercer, eVestment Alliance, SITCA, Value Research) and are asset-weighted in USD. Rankings are as of prior quarter-end for most institutional products and preceding month-end for Australian retail funds due to their late release by third parties. Rankings for the most representative fund in each GIPS composite are applied to all products within each GIPS composite. Excludes passive products, closed-end funds, private equity limited partnerships, non-discretionary funds, unit investment trusts, fund of funds with component funds managed by Invesco, stable value building block funds, and CDOs. Certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor's experience.
