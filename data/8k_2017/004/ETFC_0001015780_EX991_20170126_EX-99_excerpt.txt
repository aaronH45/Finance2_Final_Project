 “We ended the year as a more focused and energized company, and I am exceptionally proud what our team has accomplished during the past four months,” said Karl Roessner, Chief Executive Officer. “The acquisition of OptionsHouse provided the catalyst to realign the leadership team and refocus the entire Company on business performance. After taking a hard look at our structure and list of projects, we exited 2016 as a leaner, more agile organization, poised to reclaim our position as the best home for active traders and investors alike, with the number one options platform in the industry. As for results, 2016 marks our strongest earnings in 10 years, demonstrating our commitment to managing expenses with discipline, deploying multiple capital initiatives, and diminishing risk associated with our legacy loan portfolio. With balance sheet expansion already well under way, and the team aligned and marching forward on our business growth objectives, I am confident in our ability to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders in the years to come.”

 Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures and Certain Metrics  

 Management believes that adjusting GAAP measures by excluding or including certain items is helpful to investors and analysts who may wish to use some or all of this information to analyze the Company’s current performance, prospects and valuation. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally to evaluate operating performance and in formulating the budget for future periods. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures and metrics discussed below are appropriate for evaluating the operating and liquidity performance of the Company.  

 Adjusted Net Revenue  

 Management believes that excluding the loss on termination of legacy wholesale funding obligations provides more useful information about the Company's ongoing operating performance because this item is not directly related to our performance. See endnote (1) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.  

 Adjusted Operating Margin  

 Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted income before income taxes by adjusted net revenue. Adjusted income before income taxes excludes the provision (benefit) for loan losses and losses on early extinguishment of debt. The related loss on termination of legacy wholesale funding obligations is excluded from both adjusted net revenue and adjusted income before income taxes. Management believes that excluding these items from operating margin provides a useful measure of the Company's ongoing operating performance because management excludes these items when evaluating operating margin performance. See endnote (1) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.  

 Corporate Cash  

 Corporate cash represents cash held at the parent company as well as cash held in certain subsidiaries, not including bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, that can distribute cash to the parent company without any regulatory approval or notification. The Company believes that corporate cash is a useful measure of the parent company’s liquidity as it is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in regulated subsidiaries. See endnote (8) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.  

 Tangible Common Equity Book Value per Share  

 Tangible common equity book value per share represents common shareholders’ equity, which excludes preferred stock, less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of related deferred tax liabilities) divided by common stock outstanding. The Company believes that tangible common equity book value per share is a measure of the Company’s capital strength. See endnote (7) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.  

 It is important to note that these metrics and other non-GAAP measures may involve judgment by management and should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or superior to, net income or other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. For additional information on the adjustments to these non-GAAP measures, please see the Company’s financial statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” that will be included in the periodic report the Company expects to file with the SEC with respect to the financial periods discussed herein.  

 ENDNOTES  

 (1) The following tables provide reconciliations of non-GAAP adjusted income before income tax expense (benefit), adjusted operating margin percentage and adjusted net revenue to the comparable GAAP measures (dollars in millions):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (a)     A reconciliation of adjusted net revenue to net revenue is presented for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 only as no other periods presented include adjustments to net revenue for the purpose of reporting adjusted operating margin.     

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 (2) Customer margin balances include the following (dollars in billions):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (a)     Represents OptionsHouse's customer margin receivables held by third party.     

 (3) Effective January 1, 2016, the Company elected to treat E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Clearing as single member limited liability companies which resulted in a net tax benefit of $25 million for the full year 2016.  

 (4) Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the Company updated the presentation of its consolidated income statement line items for all periods presented as follows:   

 Reclassified corporate interest income and corporate interest expense from other income (expense) to net interest income;  

 Reclassified losses on early extinguishment of debt from other income (expense) to non-interest expense; and  

 Reclassified other income (expense) from other income (expense) to gains (losses) on securities and other, net.   

 Although the Company issued preferred stock during the third quarter of 2016, it has not presented the net income available to common shareholders line item as no related preferred stock dividends were declared during 2016.  

 (5) Amounts and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.  

 (6) Operating margin is the percentage of net revenue that results in income before income taxes. The percentage is calculated by dividing income before income taxes by total net revenue.  

 (7) The following tables provide a reconciliation of GAAP common equity book value and common equity book value per share to non-GAAP tangible common equity book value and tangible common equity book value per share at period end (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 (8) The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP consolidated cash and equivalents to non-GAAP corporate cash at period end (dollars in millions):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 (9) Net new and end of period brokerage accounts during the third quarter of 2016 include 147,761 accounts acquired as part of the OptionsHouse acquisition. Net new and end of period brokerage accounts during the fourth quarter 2015 were impacted by the closure of 3,007 accounts related to the shutdown of the Company's global trading platform.  

 (10) The brokerage account attrition rate is calculated by dividing attriting brokerage accounts by total brokerage accounts at the previous period end, and is presented on an annualized basis. Attriting brokerage accounts are derived by subtracting net new brokerage accounts from gross new brokerage accounts.  

 (11) Customer cash held by third parties are held outside E*TRADE Financial and include money market funds and sweep deposit accounts at unaffiliated financial institutions and customer cash held by a third party clearing firm. Customer cash held by third parties are not reflected in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and are not immediately available for liquidity purposes. The following table provides details of customer cash held by third parties (dollars in billions):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (a)     Represents OptionsHouse's customer cash held by third party.   

 (12) Net new brokerage assets and net new customer assets during the third quarter of 2016 include $3.7 billion of assets from the OptionsHouse acquisition. Net new customer assets are total inflows to all new and existing customer accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing customer accounts. The net new banking assets and net new brokerage assets metrics treat asset flows between E*TRADE entities in the same manner as unrelated third party accounts.  

 (13) Delinquent loans include charge-offs for loans that are in bankruptcy or are 180 days past due which have been written down to their expected recovery value. The following table shows the total amount of charge-offs on loans that are still held by the Company at the end of the periods presented (dollars in millions):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 (14) Includes unpaid principal balances and premiums (discounts).  

 (15) The TDR loan performance detail is a subset of the Company’s total loan performance. TDRs include loan modifications performed under the Company’s modification programs and loans that have been charged-off due to bankruptcy notification.  

 (16) Modifications are a subset of TDRs, and represent loan modifications performed under the Company’s modification programs. They do not include loans that have been charged-off due to the Company receiving notification of bankruptcy if the loan has not been modified previously by the Company. The following table shows the reconciliation of total TDRs that had a modification and those for which the Company received a notification of bankruptcy (dollars in millions):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 (17) The total expected losses on modifications includes both the previously recorded charge-offs and the specific valuation allowance.  

 (18) E*TRADE Financial’s capital ratios are calculated as follows and are preliminary for the current period (dollars in millions):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (a)     As a result of applying the transition provisions under Basel III in 2015, the Company included 25% of the TRUPs in the calculation of E*TRADE Financial’s Tier 1 capital and 75% of the TRUPs in the calculation of E*TRADE Financial’s total capital. In accordance with the transition provisions, the TRUPs were fully phased out of E*TRADE Financial's Tier 1 capital in 2016.   

  (b)     Under the regulatory guidelines for risk-based capital, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-weighted assets.     

 (19) E*TRADE Bank’s capital ratios are calculated as follows and are preliminary for the current period (dollars in millions):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (a)     Under the regulatory guidelines for risk-based capital, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-weighted assets.
