Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 

  On February 22, 2017, Humana Inc. (“Humana”) entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement (the “ASR Agreement”) with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (“Goldman Sachs”) to repurchase $1.5 billion of its common stock as part of the $2.25 billion share repurchase program that Humana announced on February 14, 2017. 

  Under the ASR Agreement, on February 27, 2017, Humana made a payment of $1.5 billion to Goldman Sachs from available cash on hand and received an initial delivery of 5,833,738 shares of Humana common stock from Goldman Sachs. The specific number of shares that Humana ultimately will repurchase pursuant to the ASR Agreement will be based generally on the daily volume-weighted average share price of Humana common stock over the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreement. Final settlement under the ASR Agreement is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2017. The ASR Agreement contains provisions customary for agreements of this type, including provisions for adjustments to the transaction terms upon certain specified events, the circumstances generally under which final settlement of the ASR Agreement may be accelerated or extended or the ASR Agreement may be terminated early by Goldman Sachs or Humana, and various acknowledgements and representations made by the parties to each other. At final settlement, under certain circumstances, Humana may be entitled to receive additional shares of Humana common stock from Goldman Sachs or Humana may be required to make a cash payment or, if Humana elects, deliver shares of Humana common stock to Goldman Sachs. The obligations of Goldman Sachs under the ASR Agreement are guaranteed by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. All of the shares of Humana common stock delivered to Humana under the ASR Agreement will be held in treasury or retired.
