        " 11 (2) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the non-operating income that remains after backing out the portion related to the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios. Management believes excluding non-operating income helps the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results, and increases comparability to prior years. Additionally, management does not emphasize the impact of non-operating income when managing the firm and evaluating its performance. The following table details the calculation of other non- operating income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016: Three months ended Year ended 12/31/2015 12/31/2016 12/31/2015 12/31/2016 Total non-operating income $ 43.4 $ 12.2 $ 103.5 $ 227.1 Less: net investment income (loss) of consolidated sponsored portfolios .6 (2.9 ) 1.5 121.1 Total other non-operating income $ 42.8 $ 15.1 $ 102.0 $ 106.0 (3) As previously disclosed, the firm made the decision in June 2016 to compensate certain clients in regard to the Dell appraisal rights matter. The firm also recognized an offset to this charge for a related insurance recovery. Management believes it is useful to readers of the firm's consolidated statements of income to adjust for this non-recurring charge in arriving at adjusted operating expenses and net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and diluted earnings per share, as this will aid with comparability to prior periods and analyzing the firm's core business results. (4) These were calculated using the effective tax rate applicable to the related items. (5) This non-GAAP measure was calculated by applying the two-class method to adjusted net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution."
