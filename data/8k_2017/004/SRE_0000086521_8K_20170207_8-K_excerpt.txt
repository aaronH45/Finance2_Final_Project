Petition for Modification Requesting Two-Year Extension to File Next Cost of Capital Application

On February 7, 2017, San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E), Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas), Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Edison Company (Edison) (collectively, the Joint Investor-Owned Utilities or Joint IOUs), along with the Office of Ratepayer Advocates (ORA) and The Utility Reform Network (TURN), filed a Joint Petition for Modification (PFM) with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) seeking a two-year extension for each of the Joint IOUs to file its next respective Cost of Capital application. The PFM reflects a memorandum of understanding (MOU) among the joint parties to modify previous CPUC Decisions (D.) 12-12-034 and 13-03-015, extending the date to file the next Cost of Capital application from April 20, 2017 to April 22, 2019 for a 2020 test year. 

In addition to the two-year extension of the deadline to file the next Cost of Capital application, the MOU contains the following provisions agreed to by the Joint IOUs, ORA and TURN:

•Effective January 1, 2018 the Joint IOUs will update their cost of capital for the following:

◦True-up of long-term debt costs to reflect actual August 2017 embedded costs and forecasted interest rates for variable interest rate long-term debt and new long-term debt issuances scheduled from September 2017 through December 2018

◦An update to preferred stock costs for any new issuances since January 1, 2013 and any new preferred stock anticipated to be issued in 2017-2018 (for SDG&E and SoCalGas, there have been no such issuances since January 1, 2013 and no issuances are anticipated through 2018)

◦An adjustment to the Return on Equity (ROE) effective January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019 for SDG&E and SoCalGas as follows:

◦The Cost of Capital adjustment mechanism (CCM) will be in effect to adjust 2019 cost of capital, if necessary. Unless changed by the operation of the CCM, the updated costs of long-term debt and preferred stock (if applicable) and new ROEs will remain in effect through December 31, 2019

◦Ratemaking capital structures, as shown below, will remain at previously adopted levels until modified, if at all, by a future Cost of Capital decision by the CPUC:

•The Joint IOUs have agreed to incur a combined $5 million in costs to create and administer a program to assist low income customers in obtaining Section 8 qualified housing. SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ combined share of the $5 million is expected to be approximately $1.2 million. 

The PFM is subject to final approval by the CPUC. If and once adopted, the Joint IOUs would submit their individual updated cost of capital and corresponding revenue requirement impacts to the CPUC in September 2017 to become effective January 1, 2018. While the actual changes to the revenue requirements resulting from this PFM would not be known until the above-mentioned filing is submitted and the actual cost of debt through August 2017 and forecasted cost through 2018 is quantified in the third quarter of 2017, SDG&E and SoCalGas estimate that the reductions in their annual revenue requirements will be within a range of $16 million to $24 million and $44 million to $52 million, respectively, beginning in 2018.

We provide additional information regarding the CPUC’s cost of capital proceeding and the CCM in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Sempra Energy’s, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

•cybersecurity threats to the energy grid, natural gas storage and pipeline infrastructure, the information and systems used to operate our businesses and the confidentiality of our proprietary information and the personal information of our customers and employees;

•expropriation of assets by foreign governments and title and other property disputes;

•the impact on reliability of SDG&E’s electric transmission and distribution system due to increased amount and variability of power supply from renewable energy sources and increased reliance on natural gas and natural gas transmission systems;

•the impact on competitive customer rates due to the growth in distributed and local power generation and the corresponding decrease in demand for power delivered through SDG&E’s electric transmission and distribution system;

•the impact on customer rates and other adverse consequences due to possible departing retail load resulting from customers transferring to Direct Access and Community Choice Aggregation;

•the inability or determination not to enter into long-term supply and sales agreements or long-term firm capacity agreements due to insufficient market interest, unattractive pricing or other factors; and

•other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.

We caution you not to rely unduly on any forward-looking statements. You should review and consider carefully the risks, uncertainties and other factors that affect our business as described herein and in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
