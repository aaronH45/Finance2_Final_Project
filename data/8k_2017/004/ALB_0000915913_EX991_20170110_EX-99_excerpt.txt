Albemarle Corporation Announces Pricing and Expiration of Any and All Tender Offers

CHARLOTTE, N.C., January 10, 2017 - Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) (the “Company” or “Albemarle”), a leader in the global specialty chemicals industry, today announced the pricing, as set forth in the table below, and expiration of its previously announced tender offers (the “Any and All Tender Offers”) to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding 3.000% notes due 2019 and 4.500% notes due 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Per $1,000 principal amount. Total Consideration (as defined below), calculated on the basis of pricing for the U.S. Treasury Reference Security as of 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 10, 2017.

The Any and All Tender Offers were made pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase, dated January 4, 2017, and the related letter of transmittal and notice of guaranteed delivery (the “Tender Offer Documents”) to purchase for cash any and all of the 2019 Notes and the 2020 Notes. The 2019 Notes and the 2020 Notes are collectively referred to herein as “Notes.”

The Any and All Tender Offers expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 10, 2017 (such time and date, the “Expiration Date”). Holders of Notes were required to validly tender and not validly withdraw their Notes prior to or at the Expiration Date to be eligible to receive the Total Consideration.

The “Total Consideration” listed in the table above for each $1,000 principal amount of each series of Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Any and All Tender Offers was determined in the manner described in the Tender Offer Documents by reference to a fixed spread specified in the table above plus the yield to maturity based on the bid-side price of the applicable U.S. Treasury Reference Security specified in the table above at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 10, 2017.

According to information provided by D.F. King & Co., Inc., the tender and information agent for the tender offers, $192,187,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and $175,191,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes were validly tendered prior to or at the Expiration Date and not validly withdrawn. These amounts include $135,000 aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes and $475,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes tendered pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedures described in the Tender Offer Documents, which remain subject to the holders’ performance of the delivery requirements under such procedures. The Company has accepted for purchase all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Expiration Date. The settlement date for the Notes is expected to be January 11, 2017 (the “Settlement Date”), although the settlement of Notes tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures is expected to be January 13, 2017 (the "Guaranteed Delivery Settlement Date").

Based on the results of the Any and All Tender Offers, the Aggregate Maximum Repurchase Amount (as defined in the offer to purchase relating to the tender offers) with respect to the Company’s offer on its 1.875% senior notes due 2021 and its 4.150% senior notes due 2024 is approximately $325 million.

Holders will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase from the applicable last interest payment date up to, but not including, the Settlement Date. The Company intends to make payment on Notes tendered by the guaranteed delivery procedures on the Guaranteed Delivery Settlement Date, but accrued interest will cease to accrue on the Settlement Date for all Notes accepted in the Any and All Tender Offers, including those tendered by the guaranteed delivery procedures.

Albemarle will fund the tender offers with the net proceeds from the previously completed sale of its Chemetall Surface Treatment segment. The tender offers are being made to reduce the Company’s outstanding debt. The Company currently intends to deliver a notice of redemption to redeem all of the 2019 Notes that were not validly tendered and accepted in the Any and All Tender Offers in accordance with the terms of the make-whole redemption provisions under the indenture governing the 2019 Notes.
