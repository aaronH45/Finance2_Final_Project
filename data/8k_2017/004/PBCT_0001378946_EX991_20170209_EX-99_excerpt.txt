Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP 

In addition to evaluating People’s United Financial Inc. ("People's United") results of operations in  

accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management routinely  

supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the  

efficiency and tangible common equity ratios, tangible book value per share and operating earnings  

metrics. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to  

investors in understanding People’s United’s underlying operating performance and trends, and  

facilitates comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. Further, the efficiency ratio  

and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance,  

including non-interest expense control, while the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value  

per share are used to analyze the relative strength of People’s United’s capital position.  

The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People’s United  

to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding operating lease  

expense, goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangible assets, losses 

on real estate assets and non-recurring expenses, which are also excluded in arriving at operating  

non-interest expense) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent ("FTE")  

basis plus total non-interest income (including the FTE adjustment on bank-owned life insurance  

("BOLI") income, the netting of operating lease expense and excluding gains and losses on sales of  

assets other than residential mortgage loans and acquired loans, and non-recurring income) (the  

denominator). People’s United generally considers an item of income or expense to be non-recurring if it  

is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not  

similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following 

two years.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP 

Operating earnings exclude from net income available to common shareholders those items that  

management considers to be of such a non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items  

(net of income taxes), People’s United’s results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent  

basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited  

to: (i) non-recurring gains/losses; (ii) merger-related expenses, including acquisition integration and  

other costs; (iii) writedowns of banking house assets and related lease termination costs; (iv) severance- 

related costs; and (v) charges related to executive-level management separation costs, are generally  

also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Effective with the quarter ended March 31, 2016,  

recurring writedowns of banking house assets and certain severance-related costs are no longer  

considered to be non-operating expenses. Operating earnings per common share is derived by  

determining the per share impact of the respective adjustments to arrive at operating earnings and  

adding (subtracting) such amounts to (from) earnings per common share, as reported. Operating return  

on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average total assets.  

Operating return on average tangible common equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings  

(annualized) by average tangible common equity. The operating dividend payout ratio is calculated by  

dividing dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.   

The tangible common equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible common equity (total stockholders’ equity  

less preferred stock, goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the numerator) to (ii)  

tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the  

denominator). Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible common equity by  

common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and  

unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") common shares).   

In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by People’s  

United for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used  

by other financial institutions.
