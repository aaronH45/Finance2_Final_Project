Item 5.02. Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

On January 24, 2017, our Compensation Committee approved 2016-related bonuses for certain of our executive officers, which are set forth below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 * Mr. Steinberg’s bonus reflects a cash payment of $667,421 representing a 2013 certified bonus on unrecognized gain associated with the sale of Inmet Mining Corporation and $556,534 of cash and securities paid to Mr. Steinberg by investee companies for Mr. Steinberg’s service as a director of such investee companies. 

The Compensation Committee also approved the 2017 performance-based bonus program for Mr. Sharp. For 2017, Mr. Sharp will be entitled to an incentive cash bonus in an amount between $0 and $4 million. The entire incentive bonus will be dependent upon Leucadia National Corporation’s 2017 consolidated earnings before income taxes. The incentive program approved by the Compensation Committee provides for no annual incentive bonus if the minimum threshold level of performance is not achieved, a target incentive bonus of $3.5 million for target performance and the maximum bonus if performance equals or exceeds the top performance threshold level. Performance falling between these levels of performance will result in an amount of bonus interpolated between such threshold levels. The Compensation Committee reserved the absolute right to take into consideration additional performance measures in determining whether to reduce the calculated bonus award. The Compensation Committee may choose to pay a portion of the bonus in restricted equity.
