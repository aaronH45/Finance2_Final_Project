Exhibit 99.1  

APD Materials Technologies business segment restatement to discontinued operations  

We are providing this supplemental non-GAAP financial disclosure to assist in updating models to reflect our Materials Technologies (MT) business segment in discontinued operations. Additionally, we’ve included a GAAP/non-GAAP reconciliation for your reference.  

The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which, when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results.  

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests) excluding certain disclosed items, which we do not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by sales.  

Required information associated with the finalization of the PMD transaction was provided separately in a Form 8-K filing.  

Some of the changes to previously reported information include:  

   •   Rare gases product line and certain delivery systems equipment were previously reported in our MT business segment and are now included in Air Products Industrial Gases regional segments.  

   •   Market-priced gases which were previously transferred at cost to the MT business segment.  

   •   Certain utility operations move from the Corporate segment to the MT business segment.  

   •   Stranded costs move to the Corporate segment.  

   •   Minor changes to our FY16 continuing operations EPS of $5.64 (estimated FY16 continuing operations EPS provided Oct. 27, 2016 was $5.74) primarily due to tax & inventory adjustments.
