Court Issues Summary Judgment against Delphi in Unsecured Creditors Litigation

As previously disclosed, Delphi Automotive PLC (“Delphi” or the “Company”) has been subject to ongoing litigation related to general unsecured claims against the former Delphi Corporation, now known as DPH Holdings Corp. (“DPHH”), resulting from that entity's 2005 bankruptcy filing. In December 2014, a complaint was filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court") alleging that the 2011 redemption by Delphi Automotive LLP, the Company's predecessor entity, of the membership interests of General Motors Company ("GM") and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") totaling $4.4 billion, and the subsequent repurchase of shares and payment of dividends by Delphi, constituted distributions under the terms of The Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Partnership Agreement of Delphi Automotive LLP (the “Fourth LLP Agreement”) approximating $7.2 billion, triggering the maximum $300 million distribution to the holders of general unsecured claims. Delphi has contested the assertions in the complaint and continues to believe that the time for payment of these distributions has not yet occurred.

 In May 2016, the Bankruptcy Court initially denied both parties' motions for summary judgment, requiring further submissions to the Bankruptcy Court regarding the parties' intent with respect to the redemptions of the GM and PBGC membership interests. On January 12, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, ruling that the membership interest redemption payments qualified as distributions, which, along with share repurchases and dividend payments made by Delphi, count toward the $7.2 billion threshold, and thus the $300 million maximum distribution for general unsecured claims has been triggered. The Bankruptcy Court will rule on the application of pre-judgment interest at a future date.

In connection with the ruling, the Company expects to record a pre-tax charge of $300 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This one-time charge will be recorded to Other expense and will not affect the Company's operating earnings. However, in accordance with the terms of the Fourth LLP Agreement, Delphi continues to consider cumulative distributions through December 31, 2016 to be substantially below the $7.2 billion threshold, and intends to vigorously contest the ruling through the appeals process, although no assurance can be given as to the outcome of any such appeal.

Background

The Fourth LLP Agreement was entered into on July 12, 2011 by the members of Delphi Automotive LLP in order to position Delphi Automotive PLC for its initial public offering. Under the terms of the Fourth LLP Agreement, if cumulative distributions to the members of Delphi Automotive LLP under certain provisions of the Fourth LLP Agreement exceed $7.2 billion, Delphi, as disbursing agent on behalf of its predecessor entity, is required to pay to the holders of allowed general unsecured claims against DPHH, $32.50 for every $67.50 in excess of $7.2 billion distributed to the members, up to a maximum amount of $300 million.
