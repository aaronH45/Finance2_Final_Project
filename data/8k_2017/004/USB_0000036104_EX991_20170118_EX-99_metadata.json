        "quarter of last year reflecting the impact of a gain on the sale of a deposit portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2015 and an increase in equity investment income in the current year quarter. Total noninterest expense decreased $21 million (8.3 percent) principally due to lower costs related to investments in tax-advantaged projects, lower net shared services expense and lower employee benefits expense, reflecting lower pension and healthcare costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher compensation expense, reflecting the impact of merit increases and higher variable compensation along with increased staffing, and higher professional services expense primarily due to compliance programs and implementation costs of capital investments to support business growth. The provision for credit losses was $7 million (63.6 percent) higher year-over-year primarily due to an unfavorable change in the reserve allocation."
