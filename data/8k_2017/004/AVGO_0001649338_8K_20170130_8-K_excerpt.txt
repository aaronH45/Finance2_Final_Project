 Item 8.01. Other Events.  

On January 30, 2017, Broadcom Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Singapore (the “Company”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a prospectus supplement (the “Prospectus Supplement”) to the prospectus dated March 4, 2016, which was included in the Company’s automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-209923). The Prospectus Supplement relates to the possible issuance of up to 22,804,591 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (“Ordinary Shares”), from time to time, to the holders of exchangeable limited partnership units of Broadcom Cayman L.P. (the “Exchangeable Units”) in accordance with the Amended and Restated Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement of Broadcom Cayman L.P. (the “Partnership Agreement”). Subject to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, from and after February 1, 2017, holders of Exchangeable Units may elect to exchange their units for Ordinary Shares or for cash, in the Company’s sole discretion. Registration of the issuance of Ordinary Shares as provided in the Prospectus Supplement does not necessarily mean that any of the holders of Exchangeable Units will exchange their Exchangeable Units or that the Company will elect to issue Ordinary Shares to satisfy its redemption obligation instead of paying a cash amount.
