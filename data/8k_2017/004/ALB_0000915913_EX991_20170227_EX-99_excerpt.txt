Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported fourth quarter 2016 net sales of $696.7 million, net income from continuing operations of $50.3 million and adjusted EBITDA of $187.4 million.

"Our three reportable segments again delivered strong results in the fourth quarter capping a year in which our three GBU's delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of $96 million, an increase of 13% compared to 2015. Full year adjusted EBITDA growth of 34% in Lithium and 21% in Refining Solutions was especially impressive," said Luke Kissam, Albemarle's Chairman, CEO and President. "We also completed key strategic initiatives in the 

1

quarter that accelerate our transformation into a premier, high growth specialty chemicals company. The sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF SE was completed, fully restoring our balance sheet, and substantially increasing our financial flexibility. We finalized the agreement with CORFO that more than triples our Lithium quota in Chile, and secures our access to the best lithium reserve in the world through 2043. Finally, we closed on the acquisition of the lithium assets of Jiangxi Jiangli New Materials Science and Technology Co. Ltd., which makes us an owner of high quality spodumene conversion assets and makes us an integrated producer of lithium salts from spodumene given our ownership position in the Talison mines in Australia."

Outlook

Our 2016 performance and strategic actions have positioned Albemarle for another strong year of growth in 2017. We expect net sales to range between $2.8 billion and $2.95 billion, with adjusted EBITDA between $800 million and $840 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $4.00 and $4.25.

Results

Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2016 was $50.3 million, or $0.37 per diluted share (after income attributable to noncontrolling interests), compared to $169.3 million, or $1.43 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2015. The decrease in 2016 was primarily related to an increase in discrete tax charges of $0.55 per diluted share, an increase in mark-to-market actuarial losses of $0.35 per diluted share and the impact of a higher tax rate in 2016 due to the level and geographic mix of income. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA increased by $12.9 million, which includes a decrease of $24.5 million in All Other as compared to prior year related to divestitures and the FCS business. See notes to the condensed consolidated financial information for further details. Fourth quarter 2016 adjusted net income from continuing operations was $88.8 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, compared to $108.1 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, for fourth quarter 2015 (see notes to the condensed consolidated financial information). The Company reported net sales of $696.7 million in fourth quarter 2016, down from net sales of $722.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, driven by the divestitures of $70.9 million, partially offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes, as well as favorable price and mix impacts in certain businesses and favorable currency exchange impacts.

Net income from continuing operations for the full year 2016 was $478.6 million, or $3.90 per diluted share (after income attributable to noncontrolling interests), compared to $327.6 million, or $2.71 per diluted share, for the full year 2015. The full year 2016 includes the gains related to the sales of the metal sulfides and minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals businesses of $1.02 per diluted share. Increases in adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments of $96.1 million were partially offset by decreased adjusted EBITDA in All Other due to divestitures, and lower adjusted EBITDA in Corporate of $54.7 million due primarily to 2015 currency gains related to cash denominated in U.S. Dollars held by foreign subsidiaries where the European Union Euro serves as the functional currency, related to the acquisition of Rockwood. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for the full year 2016 was $403.8 million, or $3.57 per diluted share, compared to $392.2 million, or $3.52 per diluted share, for the full year 2015 (see notes to the condensed consolidated financial information). Net sales for the full year 2016 were $2.68 billion, down from net sales of $2.83 billion, driven primarily by the divestitures of $265.3 million, partially offset by the favorable impact of higher sales volumes, as well as favorable price and mix impacts in certain businesses and favorable currency exchange impacts.

On December 14, 2016, the Company closed the sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF SE for cash proceeds of approximately $3.1 billion, net of estimated purchase price adjustments, and recorded an after-tax gain of $135.0 million related to the sale of this business. We used a portion of the proceeds to significantly reduce leverage, including repaying the outstanding balance of the term loan in December 2016. In the second quarter of 2016, the Company determined that the business qualified for discontinued operations treatment, and as such began accounting for its assets and liabilities as held for sale. The financial results of the disposal group and related gain on sale have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and excluded from segment results for all periods presented.

Quarterly Segment Results

Effective January 1, 2016, our former Performance Chemicals reportable segment was split into two separate reportable segments: (1) Lithium and Advanced Materials, which includes Lithium and Performance Catalyst Solutions and Curatives (“PCS”), and (2) Bromine Specialties. For comparison purposes, prior year periods have 

2

been reclassified to conform to the current segments. This split did not affect the Refining Solutions reportable segment, which is presented on the same basis as in the prior year.

Lithium and Advanced Materials reported net sales of $278.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 30.0% from fourth quarter 2015 net sales of $214.0 million. Net sales were impacted by $0.9 million of favorable currency exchange impacts as compared to the prior year. The remaining $63.4 million increase in net sales was primarily due to favorable pricing impacts and increased sales volumes. Adjusted EBITDA for Lithium and Advanced Materials was $102.5 million, an increase of 31.6% from fourth quarter 2015 results of $77.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by $1.2 million of favorable currency exchange impacts as compared to the prior year. The remaining $23.4 million increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to favorable pricing impacts partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs.

Bromine Specialties reported net sales of $194.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 13.4% from fourth quarter 2015 net sales of $171.5 million. Net sales were impacted by $1.3 million of favorable currency exchange impacts as compared to the prior year. The remaining $21.7 million increase in net sales was primarily due to higher sales volumes. Adjusted EBITDA for Bromine Specialties was $46.9 million, an increase of 11.2% from fourth quarter 2015 results of $42.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by $1.1 million of favorable currency exchange impacts as compared to the prior year. The remaining $3.6 million increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by higher sales volumes.

Refining Solutions reported net sales of $193.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 3.7% from net sales of $200.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Net sales were impacted by $0.6 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts as compared to the prior year. The remaining $6.7 million decrease in net sales was primarily driven by lower sales volumes and unfavorable pricing impacts. Adjusted EBITDA for Refining Solutions was $57.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 8.8% from fourth quarter 2015 results of $52.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by $0.3 million of favorable currency exchange impacts as compared to the prior year. The remaining $4.9 million increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher equity income from our joint venture Nippon Ketjen Company Limited due to sales volumes as well as a favorable sales mix.

On January 4, 2016, we closed the sale of the metal sulfides business, and on February 1, 2016, we closed the sale of the minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals business. The divestiture of these businesses reduced net sales and adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the prior year period by $70.9 million and $7.8 million, respectively. 

All Other net sales were $30.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 77.5% from net sales of $133.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of the divested businesses, All Other net sales decreased by $32.5 million compared to the prior year due to lower sales volumes and unfavorable pricing impacts for fine chemistry services. All Other adjusted EBITDA was a loss of less than $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 100.2% from fourth quarter 2015 results of $24.5 million. Excluding the impact of the divested businesses, All Other adjusted EBITDA decreased by $16.7 million compared to the prior year predominantly due to lower overall sales for fine chemistry services.

In summary, total net sales of $696.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of $26.0 million, or 3.6%, from fourth quarter 2015 net sales of $722.6 million, were negatively impacted by the divestiture of our metal sulfides and minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals businesses, which reduced revenues versus the prior year by $70.9 million, partially offset by favorable currency impacts of $1.6 million. Excluding currency exchange impacts and the impact of the divested businesses, net sales for the period increased 6.0% as compared to the prior year. Total adjusted EBITDA of $187.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $12.9 million, or 7.4%, from fourth quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $174.5 million, was favorably impacted by $8.1 million currency exchange (including $5.5 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts on corporate results) as well as the divestiture of our metal sulfides and minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals business, which reduced adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year by $7.8 million. Excluding currency exchange impacts and the impact of the divested businesses, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2016 increased 7.0% as compared to the prior year.

Corporate Results

Corporate adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $19.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $22.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The improvement in Corporate adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to foreign currency gains in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $5.5 million partially offset by increased compensation costs.

Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rates for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015 of 49.5% and (23.5)%, respectively, are influenced by non-recurring, other unusual and non-operating pension and OPEB items (see notes to the condensed consolidated financial information). Our adjusted effective income tax rates, which exclude non-recurring, other unusual and non-operating pension and OPEB items, were 28.3% and 11.6% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and continue to be influenced by the level and geographic mix of income. The effective tax rate in 2015 was driven down by a variety of factors including mix of income and planning related to the Rockwood acquisition. Our effective income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 18.7% and 3.6%, respectively, and excluding non-recurring, other unusual and non-operating pension and OPEB items, 20.8% and 23.1%, respectively.

Cash Flow

Our cash flow from operations was approximately $733.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, up 103% versus the same period in 2015. We had $2.27 billion in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016, as compared to $213.7 million at December 31, 2015. Cash on hand, cash provided by operations, net borrowings and net proceeds from divestitures of $3.33 billion funded $1.25 billion of debt repayments, including the full repayment of the outstanding term loan, $196.7 million of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment and dividends to shareholders of $135.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in working capital increased $239.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of the increase in income taxes payable from the gain on the sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business of $253.0 million.

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Information

(a)Non-operating pension and OPEB items, consisting of MTM actuarial gains/losses, settlements/curtailments, interest cost and expected return on assets, are not allocated to our reportable segments and are included in the Corporate category. Although non-operating pension and OPEB items are included in Cost of goods sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses in accordance with GAAP, we believe that these components of pension cost are mainly driven by market performance, and we manage these separately from the operational performance of our businesses. Non-operating pension and OPEB items included in Cost of goods sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses were as follows (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The MTM actuarial loss (gain) was $26.6 million and ($30.1) million for the three months and years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and resulted from the annual remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans in the fourth quarter.
