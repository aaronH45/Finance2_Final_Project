Item 8.01  Other Events. 

As previously disclosed, on July 21, 2016, the Department of Justice and certain state attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to block the merger between Cigna Corporation ("Cigna") and Anthem, Inc. ("Anthem"). The trial was completed on January 4, 2017. 

On January 18, 2017, Cigna received written notice from Anthem seeking to extend the termination date of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 23, 2015 (the "Merger Agreement"), from January 31, 2017 through April 30, 2017. Following the issuance of the Court's opinion, Cigna intends to evaluate its options in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Current Report on Form 8-K may contain forward looking information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements may include statements regarding the proposed merger between Cigna and Anthem, Inc. You may identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as "believe," "expect," "plan," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "may," "should," "will" or other words or expressions of similar meaning, although not all forward-looking statements contain such terms. 

Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the timing and likelihood of completion of the proposed merger, including the timing, receipt and terms and conditions of any required governmental and regulatory approvals for the proposed merger that could reduce anticipated benefits or cause the parties to abandon the transaction; the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation from the proposed merger will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the risk that the businesses of Cigna and Anthem will not be integrated successfully; disruption from the proposed merger making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; the risk that unexpected costs will be incurred; the possibility that the proposed merger does not close, including due to the failure to satisfy the closing conditions; the risk that financing for the proposed merger may not be available on favorable terms, as well as more specific risks and uncertainties discussed in our most recent report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K available on the Investor Relations section of www.cigna.com as well as on Anthem's most recent report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K available on the Investor Relations section of www.antheminc.com. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made, are not guarantees of future performance or results, and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Cigna undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.
