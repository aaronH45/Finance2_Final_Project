SEATTLE, WASHINGTON - February 21, 2017, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) today announced fourth quarter 2016 financial results including the following highlights compared to the same quarter of 2015:

•Diluted Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders per share (EPS1) remained constant at $0.61

•Operating Income decreased 3% to $172 million

•Airfreight tonnage and ocean container volumes both increased 12% to record levels

“Through the hard work and dedication of our people, we shipped the most freight in our Company’s history and gained market share in the fourth quarter, as we did throughout 2016,” said Jeffrey S. Musser, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are especially pleased with the growth in our customs brokerage and other services, particularly in the U.S. through our Transcon business. Rates remained highly unpredictable in the quarter, as they were throughout much of 2016, again putting unusual pressure on our margins. While experience has shown us that margin pressure is cyclical, in light of such truly unprecedented rate volatility, we are improving processes to better address the rapid changes in buy and sell rates, which we expect to continue.

“We continue to execute our strategic initiatives and remain focused on expanding our business and exploring opportunities for growth. At the same time, given the uncertainties for global trade, we are also working hard to expand our presence in markets that are less uncertain. In addition, we recently appointed one of our most senior executives, Phil Coughlin, to the new position of Chief Strategy Officer to form a team that will explore additional opportunities for growth. As a market leader, we recognize that in order to maintain our leadership position and remain at the forefront of innovation, we must continuously invest in people, processes and technology. We believe the additional investments we’re making will enhance our market position.”

Bradley S. Powell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, added, “We shipped record volumes and again maintained operating income as a percentage of net revenues - a key measure of operating efficiency - above 30%. We believe the additional investments we have made in people and technology are delivering enhanced growth and market share. In 2017, we will continue to make additional important investments in technology and in our strategic efforts to explore new areas for profitable growth.”

Net Revenues (Non-GAAP measure)

We commonly refer to the term “net revenues” when commenting about our Company and the results of its operations. Net revenues are a Non-GAAP measure calculated as revenues less directly related operating expenses attributable to the Company's principal services. We believe that net revenues are a better measure than are total revenues when analyzing and discussing our effectiveness in managing our principal services since total revenues earned as a freight consolidator include the carriers' charges to us for carrying the shipment, whereas revenues earned in other capacities include primarily the commissions and fees earned by us. Net revenue is one of our primary operational and financial measures and demonstrates our ability to concentrate and leverage purchasing power through effective consolidation of shipments from customers utilizing a variety of transportation carriers and optimal routings. Using net revenues also provides a commonality for comparison among various services. The following table presents the calculation of net revenues.
