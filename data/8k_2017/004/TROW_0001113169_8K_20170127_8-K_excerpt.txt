SECTION 8 - OTHER EVENTS.

Item 8.01. Other Events.

On January 26, 2017, the Company issued an earnings release that contained disclosures regarding net client cash flows for the fourth quarter of 2016, and the year-ended December 31, 2016. In that disclosure, it was reported that the Company’s target-date retirement portfolios were the source of $1.9 billion of the Company’s net cash outflows for the fourth quarter of 2016 and net cash inflows of $6.3 billion for the year-ended December 31, 2016. 

Based on further analysis of the net cash flows that originated in these portfolios, specifically analysis of exchanges between certain of the portfolios, the Company determined that net cash flows originating in its target-date retirement portfolios were net outflows of $63 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and net inflows of $8.1 billion for the year-ended December 31, 2016. 

These changes do not affect the Company’s overall net cash flows reported in the earnings release, including the net cash outflows of $5.0 billion and $2.8 billion reported for the fourth quarter of 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.
