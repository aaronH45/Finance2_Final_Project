Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained. These factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 13, 2017, and include the following:

•risks that our tenants will not pay rent, may vacate early or may file for bankruptcy or that we may be unable to renew leases or re-let space at favorable rents as leases expire;

•risks that we may not be able to proceed with or obtain necessary approvals for any redevelopment or renovation project, and that completion of anticipated or ongoing property redevelopment or renovation projects that we do pursue may cost more, take more time to complete or fail to perform as expected;

•risk that we are investing a significant amount in ground-up development projects that may not perform as planned, may be dependent on third parties to deliver critical aspects of certain projects, requires spending a substantial amount upfront in infrastructure, and assumes receipt of public funding which has been committed but not entirely funded;

•risks normally associated with the real estate industry, including risks that occupancy levels at our properties and the amount of rent that we receive from our properties may be lower than expected, that new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected, that competition for acquisitions could result in increased prices for acquisitions, that costs associated with the periodic maintenance and repair or renovation of space, insurance and other operations may increase, that environmental issues may develop at our properties and result in unanticipated costs, and, because real estate is illiquid, that we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate;

•risks that our growth will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital;

•risks associated with general economic conditions, including local economic conditions in our geographic markets;

•risks of financing, such as our ability to consummate additional financings or obtain replacement financing on terms which are acceptable to us, our ability to meet existing financial covenants and the limitations imposed on our operations by those covenants, and the possibility of increases in interest rates that would result in increased interest expense; and

•risks related to our status as a real estate investment trust, commonly referred to as a REIT, for federal income tax purposes, such as the existence of complex tax regulations relating to our status as a REIT, the effect of future changes in REIT requirements as a result of new legislation, and the adverse consequences of the failure to qualify as a REIT.

Financial Results

Net income available for common shareholders was $57.9 million and earnings per diluted share was $0.80 for fourth quarter 2016 versus $67.8 million and $0.97, respectively, for fourth quarter 2015 ($0.73 per diluted share excluding a $0.24 gain on sale in the fourth quarter 2015). For the full year 2016, Federal Realty reported net income available for common shareholders of $249.4 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.50. This compares to net income available for common shareholders of $209.7 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.03 for the full year 2015. 

In the fourth quarter 2016, Federal Realty generated funds from operations available for common shareholders (FFO) of $104.9 million, or $1.45 per diluted share. This compares to FFO of $96.5 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2015. For the full year 2016, FFO was $406.4 million, or $5.65 per diluted share, compared to $352.9 million, or $5.05 per diluted share for the full year 2015. Excluding an early extinguishment of debt charge in 2015, FFO per diluted share for the full year 2015 was $5.32. 

FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental earnings measure which the Trust considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is attached to this press release.

Portfolio Results

In fourth quarter 2016, same-center property operating income increased 3.0% when including properties that are being redeveloped and 2.1% when excluding those properties. For the year 2016, same-center property operating income increased 3.1% when including properties that are being redeveloped and 1.9% when excluding those properties. As anticipated, an unusually high number of anchor vacancies, both proactively pursued and otherwise, negatively impacted the quarterly and year end results.

The overall portfolio was 94.4% leased as of December 31, 2016, compared to 94.3% on December 31, 2015. Federal Realty’s same center portfolio was 95.7% leased on December 31, 2016, compared to 95.9% on December 31, 2015.

During fourth quarter 2016, Federal Realty signed 89 leases for 347,604 square feet of retail space. On a comparable space basis (i.e., spaces for which there was a former tenant), Federal Realty leased 274,622 square feet at an average cash basis contractual rent increase (i.e., excluding the impact of straight-line rents) of 15%. The average contractual rent on this comparable space for the first year of the new leases is $37.10 per square foot compared to the average contractual rent of $32.27 per square foot for the last year of the prior leases. The previous average contractual rent was calculated by including both the minimum rent and any percentage rent actually paid during the last year of the lease term for the re-leased space. On a GAAP basis (i.e., including the impact of straight-line rents), rent increases for comparable retail space averaged 27% for fourth quarter 2016.

The average contractual rent on this comparable space for the first year of the new leases is $34.72 per square foot compared to the average contractual rent of $30.63 per square foot for the last year of the prior leases. As of December 31, 2016, Federal Realty’s average contractual minimum rent for retail and commercial space in its portfolio is $26.91 per square foot, as compared to $26.28 per square foot on December 31, 2015.

Notes:

(1)There is no guarantee that the Trust will ultimately complete any or all of these opportunities, that the Projected Return on Investment (ROI) or Projected Costs will be the amounts shown or that stabilization will occur as anticipated. The projected ROI and Projected Cost are management's best estimate based on current information and may change over time. 

(2)Projected ROI for redevelopment projects generally reflects only the deal specific cash, unleveraged incremental Property Operating Income (POI) generated by the redevelopment and is calculated as Incremental POI divided by incremental cost. Incremental POI is the POI generated by the redevelopment after deducting rent being paid or management's estimate of rent to be paid for the redevelopment space and any other space taken out of service to accommodate the redevelopment. Projected ROI for redevelopment projects does not include peripheral impacts, such as the impact on future lease rollovers at the property or the impact on the long-term value of the property.  

(3)Stabilization is generally the year in which 95% physical occupancy of the redeveloped space is achieved. Economic stabilization may occur at a later point in time. 

(4)All subtotals and totals reflect cost weighted-average ROIs. 

 15

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Notes:

(1)Anticipated opening dates, total cost, projected return on investment (ROI), and projected POI percentages are subject to adjustment as a result of factors inherent in the development process, some of which may not be under

 the direct control of the Company. Refer to the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for other risk factors.

(2)Percentage figures reflect (i) the projected POI (herein defined) for the stated year divided by (ii) the current projected annual stabilized POI for the Property. These percentages are projections only and we cannot give any

 assurances that these amounts will actually be achieved.

(3)Projected ROI for development projects reflects the unleveraged Property Operating Income (POI) generated by the development and is calculated as POI divided by cost.

(4)Projected costs for Assembly Row and Pike & Rose include an allocation of infrastructure costs for the entire project.

(5)Costs are net of expected reimbursement by third parties and land sale proceeds from expected exercise of option. Phase II total costs include our share of the costs in the hotel.

(6)Condominiums shown at cost; the projected ROI for Phase II does not assume any incremental profit on the sale of condominium units; condominiums are assumed to be sold at cost.

(7)Excludes approximately $5 million of costs incurred to date of which we have claims for recovery against 3rd parties.

Glossary of Terms

Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that means net income or loss plus depreciation and amortization, net interest expense, income taxes, gain or loss on sale of real estate, and impairments of real estate, if any. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because it approximates a key performance measure in our debt covenants, but it should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Funds From Operations (FFO): FFO is a supplemental measure of real estate companies' operating performances. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as follows: net income, computed in accordance with GAAP plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on sale of real estate, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate. NAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure of performance and liquidity of an equity REIT in order to recognize that the value of income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. However, FFO does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income); should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance; and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to pay dividends. We consider FFO a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. 

Property Operating Income: Rental income, other property income and mortgage interest income, less rental expenses and real estate taxes.

Overall Portfolio: Includes all operating properties owned in reporting period.

Same Center: Information provided on a same center basis is provided for only those properties that were owned, operated, and consolidated for the entirety of both periods being compared, excludes properties that were redeveloped, expanded or under development and properties purchased or sold at any time during the periods being compared. Same center growth statistics are calculated on a GAAP basis. 

Tenant Improvements and Incentives: Represents not only the total dollars committed for the improvement (fit-out) of a space as it relates to a specific lease and, except for redevelopments, may also include base building costs (i.e. expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable. Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements.
