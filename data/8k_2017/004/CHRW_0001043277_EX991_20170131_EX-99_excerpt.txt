FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  

C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS  

MINNEAPOLIS, January 31, 2017 – C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (“C.H. Robinson”) (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. This table of summary results presents our service line net revenues consistent with our historical presentation and is on an enterprise basis. The service line net revenues in the table differ from the segment service line net revenues discussed below as our segments have revenues from multiple service lines. Summarized financial results are set forth in the following table (dollars in thousands, except per share data).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our total revenues increased 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in total revenues was driven by volume growth across all of our services. Our total net revenues decreased 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The net revenue decline was primarily the result of lower truckload margins. APC Logistics (“APC”), which was acquired at the close of business on September 30, 2016, represented approximately two percent of our total net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016.  

For the fourth quarter, our total operating expenses increased 3.3 percent. Total other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 22.3 percent, driven by growth in claims, bad debt provision, and costs related to the APC acquisition. The increase in other selling, general, and administrative expenses was partially offset by a 2.9 percent decrease in personnel expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The decline in personnel expense was the result of decreased expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability. Average headcount increased approximately seven percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.

Interest and other expenses declined approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we had approximately $4 million in currency gains, primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we wrote off a $7.2 million indemnification asset related to the acquisition of Phoenix International Freight Services, Ltd., as the indemnification expired.  

Results by Segment  

Commencing with this quarter, we are now reporting operating results based on three reportable segments. Our three reportable segments are: North American Surface Transportation (“NAST”), Global Forwarding, and Robinson Fresh. The balance of our business is reported as “All Other and Corporate.” All Other and Corporate includes our non-reportable segments, including Managed Services and Other Surface Transportation.  

NAST provides freight transportation services across North America through a network of offices in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The primary services provided by NAST include truckload, less than truckload (“LTL”), and intermodal. Summarized financial results of our NAST segment are as follows (dollars in thousands):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Excludes intersegment revenues.  

NAST total revenues increased 5.1 percent to $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 from $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase was driven by volume increases in all services. NAST net revenues decreased 8.8 percent to $363.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $398.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily from a decline in truckload net revenues.  

NAST truckload net revenues decreased 12.9 percent to $261.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $299.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, while truckload volumes increased approximately 10 percent. NAST truckload net revenue margin decreased in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, due primarily to lower customer pricing.  

NAST accounted for approximately 92 percent of our total North America truckload net revenues in the fourth quarter in both 2016 and 2015. The majority of the remaining North American truckload net revenues is included in Robinson Fresh. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel prices, our average North America truckload rate per mile charged to our customers decreased approximately 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Our truckload transportation costs were flat, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel prices.  

NAST LTL net revenues increased 5.1 percent to $90.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $86.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. NAST LTL volumes increased approximately five percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, and net revenue margin decreased slightly.  

NAST intermodal net revenues decreased 15.8 percent to $7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This was primarily due to net revenue margin declines, partially offset by increased volumes. During the fourth quarter of 2016, intermodal opportunities were negatively impacted by the alternative lower cost truck market.  

NAST operating expenses decreased 4.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $205.7 million compared to $214.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This was primarily due to decreases in personnel expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability. These decreases were partially offset by increases in claims and allowance for doubtful accounts. The operating expenses of NAST and all other segments include allocated corporate expenses.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Customs net revenues increased 48.5 percent to $15.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. These increases were primarily due to volume increases, including those from APC.  

Global Forwarding operating expenses increased 26.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $89.4 million from $70.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. These increases were driven by an average headcount increase of 13.9 percent, an increase in claims, and higher allowance for doubtful accounts in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, the acquisition of APC contributed to the increase in operating expenses, including amortization, for Global Forwarding.  

Robinson Fresh provides sourcing services under the name of Robinson Fresh. Our sourcing services primarily include the buying, selling, and marketing of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other perishable items. Robinson Fresh sources products from around the world and has a physical presence in North America, Europe, Asia, and South America.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Excludes intersegment revenues.

Robinson Fresh net revenues decreased 7.9 percent to $51.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $56.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of declines in transportation and sourcing net revenues.  

Robinson Fresh sourcing net revenues decreased 3.5 percent to $25.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $26.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to lower market pricing and changes in the service mix.

Robinson Fresh transportation net revenues decreased 11.9 percent to $25.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $29.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to decreases in truckload revenue, partially offset by increases in their other transportation services net revenues. Robinson Fresh transportation net revenue margin decreased in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, due primarily to lower customer pricing.  

Robinson Fresh operating expenses decreased 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $38.8 million from $40.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This was primarily due to decreases in personnel expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability, partially offset by an increase in warehousing expenses related to expanding facilities and an increase in average headcount.  

All Other and Corporate includes our Managed Services segment, as well as Other Surface Transportation outside of North America and other miscellaneous revenues. Other Surface Transportation revenues are primarily earned by Europe Surface Transportation. Europe Surface Transportation provides services similar to NAST across the European continent.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Managed Services net revenues increased 32.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $17.7 million compared to $13.3 million the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase was a result of growth from both new and existing customers. Other surface transportation increased 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $14.7 million compared to $13.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily the result of growth in Europe Surface Transportation.
