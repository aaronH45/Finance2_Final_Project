Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

Separation Agreement with Bioverativ Inc.

On February 1, 2017, Biogen Inc. (“Biogen”) completed the previously announced separation of its hemophilia business, and certain other assets and liabilities, into a separate, independent publicly traded company by way of a distribution of all of the then outstanding shares of common stock of Bioverativ Inc. (“Bioverativ”) through a dividend in-kind of Bioverativ’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to Biogen’s stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 17, 2017 (the entire transaction being the “Separation”). 

In connection with the Separation, Biogen entered into a separation agreement with Bioverativ, dated as of January 31, 2017, that, among other things, sets forth our agreements with Bioverativ regarding the principal actions to be taken in connection with the Separation, including the distribution. The separation agreement identifies assets to be transferred, liabilities to be assumed and contracts to be assigned to each of Bioverativ and Biogen as part of the Separation, and it provides for when and how these transfers, assumptions and assignments will occur. Biogen and Bioverativ are also each subject to nine-month non-solicit and two-year non-compete restrictions.

The foregoing description of the separation agreement is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of the separation agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

Item 2.01 Completion of the Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

As described above, on February 1, 2017, Biogen completed the Separation. In the Separation, Biogen stockholders received one share of Bioverativ common stock for every two shares of Biogen common stock held at the close of business on January 17, 2017. Biogen did not issue fractional shares of Bioverativ’s common stock in the distribution. Eligible stockholders are entitled to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares. 

Item 8.01 Other Events

On February 1, 2017, Biogen issued a press release announcing the completion of the Separation. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
