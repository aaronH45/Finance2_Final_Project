NEW YORK, NY (January 17, 2017) - UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) reported fourth quarter and full year 2016 results driven by broad-based, balanced growth across the enterprise.

Optum combined strong organic growth and strategic investments to drive revenue growth of nearly 24 percent in 2016.

Hemsley, chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group.

The Company affirmed its 2017 financial outlook, including estimated revenues of $197 billion to $199 billion, net earnings of $8.75 to $9.05 per share, adjusted net earnings of $9.30 to $9.60 per share, and cash flows from operations of $11.5 billion to $12 billion.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

•Adjusted Net Earnings per Share

•Adjusted Cash Flows from Operations

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted cash flows from operations are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the use of adjusted net earnings per share provides investors and management useful information about the earnings impact of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. 

Management believes that the use of adjusted cash flows from operations provides investors and management with useful information to compare our cash flows from operations for the current period to that of other periods, when the Company does not receive its monthly payment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the applicable quarter. CMS generally remits their monthly payments on the first calendar day of the applicable month. However, if the first calendar day of the month falls on a weekend or a holiday, CMS has typically paid the Company on the last business day of the preceding calendar month. As such, quarterly operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP may occasionally include CMS premium payments for two months or four months. Adjusted cash flows from operating activities presents operating cash flows assuming all CMS payments were received on the first calendar day of the applicable month.
