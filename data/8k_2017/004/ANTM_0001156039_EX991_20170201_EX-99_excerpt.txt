Indianapolis, Ind. – February 1, 2017 – Anthem, Inc. (NYSE: ANTM) today announced that fourth quarter 2016 net income was $368.4 million, or $1.37 per share. These results included net negative adjustment items of $0.39 per share. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $180.9 million, or $0.68 per share, which included net negative adjustment items of $0.46 per share.  

Excluding the items noted in each period, adjusted net income was $1.76 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the adjusted net income of $1.14 per share in the prior year quarter (refer to page 14 for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or “GAAP”).  

Full year 2016 net income totaled approximately $2.5 billion, or $9.21 per share, including net negative adjustment items of $1.79 per share, a decrease in net income of 3.5 percent from 2015 net income of approximately $2.6 billion, or $9.38 per share, including net negative adjustment items of $0.78 per share.

CONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS  

Membership: Medical enrollment totaled approximately 39.9 million members at December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately 1.3 million members, or 3.4 percent, from 38.6 million at December 31, 2015. Commercial & Specialty Business enrollment increased by 706 thousand medical members as the Company experienced growth in the National and Local Group self-funded businesses. Enrollment also grew by 613 thousand in the Medicaid business.  

Medical enrollment was relatively flat sequentially during the fourth quarter of 2016. Enrollment increases in the Medicaid and Local Group businesses were largely offset by declines in the Individual and National businesses.  

Operating Revenue: Operating revenue was approximately $21.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of approximately $1.5 billion, or 7.3 percent, versus the approximately $20.0 billion in the prior year quarter. The growth in revenue reflected premium increases to cover overall cost trends and higher enrollment in the Medicaid and Commercial self-funded businesses. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Local Group fully insured enrollment.  

Benefit Expense Ratio: The benefit expense ratio was 87.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 20 basis points from 87.0 percent in the prior year quarter. The increase was largely driven by higher medical cost experience in the Medicaid business, notably in Iowa, exceeding the net impact of annual premium rate adjustments and higher membership, which carries a higher benefit expense ratio than the consolidated company average. Also contributing to the increase was the impact of higher medical cost experience in the Individual business. These increases were partially offset by the impact of a retroactive change in the minimum MLR calculation under California’s Medicaid expansion program, the timing of lower medical cost experience in the Local Group business and lower medical cost experience in the Medicare business.  

Medical claims reserves established at December 31, 2015 developed moderately better than the Company’s expectation during 2016.  

Medical Cost Trend: For the full year 2016, underlying Local Group medical cost trend was at the low end of our previously guided range of 7.0% - 7.5%. The Company anticipates that underlying Local Group medical cost trend will be in the range of 6.5% - 7.0% in 2017. The decline versus 2016 primarily reflects the expectation that Hepatitis C treatment costs will not increase in 2017 like they did in 2016, which was driven by a change in our Hepatitis C coverage policy at the end of 2015.  

Days in Claims Payable: Days in Claims Payable (“DCP”) was 41.3 days as of December 31, 2016, an increase of 0.7 days from 40.6 days as of September 30, 2016.  

SG&A Expense Ratio: The SG&A expense ratio was 15.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 110 basis points from 16.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of lower administrative costs resulting from expense efficiency initiatives and higher operating revenue, which includes the impact of membership growth in the Medicaid business, which carries a lower SG&A expense ratio than the consolidated Company average.  

Operating Cash Flow: Operating cash flow was $275 million, or 0.7 times net income in the fourth quarter of 2016, and approximately $3.2 billion, or 1.3 times net income for the full year 2016. For 2017, the Company expects operating cash flow to be greater than $3.5 billion.  

2  

Share Repurchase Program: The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the pending acquisition of Cigna. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had nearly $4.2 billion of Board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining.  

Cash Dividend: During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $171.3 million.  

Investment Portfolio & Capital Position: During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded net realized gains on financial instruments totaling $28.7 million and other-than-temporary impairment losses totaling $11.8 million. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded net realized gains of $30.6 million and other-than-temporary impairment losses totaling $28.5 million.  

As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s net unrealized gain position in the investment portfolio was $567.7 million, consisting of net unrealized gains on equity and fixed maturity securities totaling $396.6 and $171.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $1.4 billion, including the timing impact of changes in inter-company funding arrangements during the quarter. Adjusted for the timing impact of these changes, which was resolved in early 2017, cash and investments at the parent company would have totaled approximately $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2016.

 (2) “NM” = calculation not meaningful.  

Commercial & Specialty Business: Operating gain in the Commercial & Specialty Business segment totaled $189.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $133.4 million, or 239.1 percent, from $55.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase was driven by lower administrative costs resulting from expense efficiency initiatives taken by the Company, the timing of lower medical cost experience in the Local Group business and self-funded membership growth. This increase was partially offset by higher medical cost experience in the Individual business and fully insured membership declines in the Local Group business, as expected.  

Government Business: Operating gain in the Government Business segment was $529.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $112.1 million, or 26.8 percent, from $417.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase reflected the impact of lower administrative costs resulting from expense efficiency initiatives taken by the Company, the retroactive change in the minimum MLR calculation under California’s Medicaid expansion program and lower medical cost experience in the Medicare business. The increase was partially offset by higher medical cost experience in the Medicaid business, notably in Iowa, exceeding the net impact of annual premium rate adjustments.  

Other: The Company reported an operating loss of $66.1 million in the Other segment for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with an operating loss of $33.8 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in the loss was primarily driven by Cigna acquisition related expenses.

Basis of Presentation  

 1. Operating revenue and operating gain are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reporting segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense and selling, general and administrative expense. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains/losses on financial instruments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management (refer to page 14 for the GAAP reconciliation tables).  

 2. Operating margin is defined as operating gain divided by operating revenue.
