Approval of Executive Employment Agreement

The Committee determined that it was appropriate for the Company and one of its affiliates, Crown Imports LLC (“Crown” and collectively with the Company, “Constellation”), to enter into an Executive Employment Agreement (the “New Employment Agreement”) with William F. Hackett, Executive Vice President and Chairman, Beer Division, which will be effective March 1, 2017. The New Employment Agreement supersedes Mr. Hackett’s currently existing employment agreement with Constellation, dated as of June 17, 2013, which was filed as Exhibit 10.10 to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2013.

The New Employment Agreement with Mr. Hackett contains provisions concerning his term of employment, compensation, and voluntary and involuntary termination of employment. The term of Mr. Hackett’s New Employment Agreement runs from March 1, 2017 until February 28, 2019, provided that either Mr. Hackett or Constellation may terminate the New Employment Agreement with at least 90 days advance written notice. The New Employment Agreement provides for an initial annual salary level for Mr. Hackett in the amount of $354,000, which, following February 28, 2018, may be adjusted upwards or downwards by the Committee or its delegate. Upon termination of the New Employment Agreement, unless the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company expressly determines otherwise, Mr. Hackett will not be eligible for severance under any arrangement maintained by Constellation.

In addition, the New Employment Agreement contains restrictions upon Mr. Hackett’s ability, during and after the period of employment, to use confidential information or trade secrets of the Company, to provide services that are competitive with the Company, and to solicit or induce employees to terminate their employment relationships with the Company.

The preceding description of Mr. Hackett’s New Employment Agreement is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the New Employment Agreement filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1, all of which is incorporated herein by reference.
