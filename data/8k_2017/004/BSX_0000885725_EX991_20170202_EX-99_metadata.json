        "Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, and adjusted net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and/or the impacts of recent acquisitions with significant sales, are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes."
