*Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation (ACN) business includes Abbott’s historical Vascular Products segment and the businesses of St. Jude Medical, LLC. St. Jude Medical’s vascular closure business has been removed from all periods presented above given the recent divestiture of this business. Administrative fees paid by St. Jude Medical to group purchasing organizations have been reclassified from the Selling, general and administrative line in St. Jude Medical’s historical financial statements and are included as a reduction to revenue to conform to Abbott’s presentation. Abbott completed its acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Inc. (now St. Jude Medical, LLC) on January 4, 2017.
