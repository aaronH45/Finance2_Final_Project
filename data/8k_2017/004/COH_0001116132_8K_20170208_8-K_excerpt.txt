Such stockholder(s) or group(s) of stockholders may nominate director candidates constituting up to the greater of two individuals or 20% of the Board, provided that the stockholder(s) and the director nominee(s) satisfy the eligibility, notice and other requirements specified in the Bylaws. Stockholders may utilize proxy access beginning with the Company’s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders. 

This is a summary of changes effected by adoption of the amendment of the Bylaws, which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Bylaws filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
