ST. LOUIS, Jan. 5, 2017 - In the first quarter, Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) delivered higher earnings per share (EPS) than the prior year thanks to the strength of the company’s South American business. In 2017, the company remains focused on delivering on its operational plan and key business milestones while simultaneously working with Bayer on the necessary steps to finalize the deal to merge the companies, which is targeted for the end of calendar year 2017. Additionally, in its annual research-and-development update today, the company will highlight more than 20 phase advancements across the industry’s broadest pipeline, which is focused on helping farmers address current and future challenges.

“We’ve been very pleased with the strong support - especially from shareowners and growers - for the agreement to combine with Bayer,” said Hugh Grant, chairman and chief executive officer. “We expect the combination with Bayer to amplify the rate of innovation faster than either company could achieve alone, which will be critical in helping to increase grower productivity to meet projected demand in the decades ahead.”

“The last several years have brought record-breaking achievements for our pipeline, and this year is no different,” said Robb Fraley, Ph.D., executive vice president and chief technology officer, regarding this year’s annual pipeline update. “To answer the challenges growers face, our teams have been successful in finding the best scientific disciplines for the job - whether it’s breeding, biotech, crop protection, biologicals or Climate FieldView™ products. And with Bayer, we truly see the opportunity to accelerate innovation, optimize integrated solutions and expand offerings - translating to significant benefits for farmers.”

Results of Operations

Net sales for the fiscal year 2017 first quarter increased over the prior year’s first quarter to $2.7 billion versus $2.2 billion in the prior year period. Gross profit for the quarter increased to $1.3 billion versus the prior year period of $0.9 billion. 

Selling, general and administrative costs were $585 million and research and development expenses were $370 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Total operating spend decreased with reduced restructuring expenses more than offsetting increases from pending Bayer transaction related costs, growth in commissions in South America and unfavorable impact of currency on spend.

The company’s fiscal year 2017 first quarter EPS on an as-reported basis was $0.07 which included $0.19 of pending Bayer transaction related costs. EPS on an ongoing basis was $0.21, well above the prior year’s ongoing loss of $0.11, driven by the expected strong start to the business in South America and currency effects. (For a reconciliation of as-reported EPS to ongoing EPS see note 1).

Cash Flow

For the first three months of fiscal year 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion, compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion in the first three months last year. Net cash required by investing activities for the first three months of fiscal year 2017 was $327 million, compared to $336 million for the same period of fiscal year 2016. Net cash required by financing activities for the first three months of fiscal year 2017 was $655 million, compared to net cash required of $2.4 billion for the same period of fiscal year 2016. Free cash flow was a source of $1.1 billion for the first three months of fiscal year 2017, compared to $1 billion for the same period of fiscal year 2016. (For a reconciliation of free cash flow, see note 1).

Fiscal Year 2017 Outlook

With the expected strong start in the first quarter and continued focus on return on innovation and financial discipline, the company remains confident in its fiscal year 2017 outlook. Despite the fact that the year-over-year change in currency rates was modestly favorable in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, the company continues to assume that the change in rates will have a relatively neutral effect on a full year basis given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against several currencies. 

The fiscal year 2017 full-year as-reported EPS guidance is expected to be in the range of $3.97 to $4.45. These earnings are expected to translate into $2.4-to-$2.8 billion of operating cash flows and $1.4-to-$1.6 billion of free cash flows, after deducting an estimated $1.0-to-$1.2 billion of investing cash flows. These investing cash flows reflect the planned investment in the company’s dicamba manufacturing facility and assume the successful sale of the precision agriculture equipment business. On an ongoing basis, the fiscal year 2017 EPS is expected to be in 

the range of $4.50-to-$4.90, reflecting expected growth for the year. (For a reconciliation of free cash flow and as-reported to ongoing EPS, see note 1).

The company expects roughly $100 million of gross profit from strategic licensing deals towards the end of the fiscal year which is anticipated to be roughly split between Seeds and Genomics and Ag Productivity. Seeds and Genomics segment gross profit is expected to increase to mid-single digits as a percent year-over-year, with soybean gross profit alone expected to grow by more than 20 percent, driven by new trait penetration and an anticipated reduction in cost of goods sold. In corn, growth is expected to come from global genetic share gains and global germplasm price mix lift in local currency that is flat to up low-single-digits, in terms of percentages. The company expects global corn acres to be roughly flat, with declines in U.S. corn acreage offset by the early increases in South America. 

The company adjusted Ag Productivity gross profit to the expected range of $850-to-$950 million, reflecting year-over-year price declines in glyphosate-based herbicides in the first half of the year, offset partially by the benefit of licensing opportunities and expected higher volumes. The adjustment in gross profit outlook is a result of the approximately $85 million benefit from the sale of the Latitude® wheat fungicide business that was ultimately recorded in other expense, net for the segment, as opposed to gross profit as anticipated. 

The company’s restructuring and cost savings initiatives remain on track, with the opportunity to deliver approximately $380 million in annual savings at the close of fiscal 2017 in operating expenses and cost of good sold, as compared to fiscal year 2015. However, setting aside pending Bayer transaction related costs and restructuring expenses, overall operating expenses in fiscal 2017 are expected to increase slightly with inflation and the costs associated with the return to growth of the business more than offsetting the savings. The expected tax rate for the year remains in the range of 25-to-28 percent.

For the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, the company expects as-reported and ongoing earnings per share that is approximately $0.20 to $0.50 better than the prior year. The company sees this first half earnings improvement as a reflection of the benefit from the sale of the Latitude business and the absence of a significant portion of the Argentine peso devaluation from the prior year. In the second half of the fiscal year, the company expects roughly 40 cents less in earnings per share benefit from strategic deals versus the prior year in addition to a more challenging currency environment than in the first quarter.

Seeds and Genomics Segment Detail

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(A) Fiscal first quarter 2017 and 2016 seeds and genomics gross profit includes a pretax restructuring charge totaling $1 million and $52 million, respectively, related to certain asset impairment charges, primarily in the corn business, which is included in cost of goods sold. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(A) EBIT is defined as earnings (loss) before interest and taxes. Interest and taxes are recorded on a total company basis. We do not record these items at the segment level.

The Seeds and Genomics segment consists of the global seeds and related traits business, biotechnology platforms and digital agriculture. 

Net sales for the Seeds and Genomics segment in the first three months of fiscal 2017 were $1.8 billion. This included a greater than 25 percent increase in planted corn acres in Argentina and more than a 10 percent increase in corn acres planted in Brazil accompanied by double-digit price increases in corn germplasm in local currency in both countries. In the U.S., demand for year-one hybrids remains strong and the early read on the order book supports the company’s intention to grow genetic share. 

The company continues to build on the momentum of Intacta RR2 PRO™ soybeans in South America as it remains on track to reach a target of 45 to 55 million acres in fiscal year 2017. In the U.S., demand for Roundup Ready 2 Xtend™ soybeans remains strong and the company is well-supplied for more than 15 million acres of the product. With the EPA approval for in-crop use of dicamba in-hand, the company has received nearly two-thirds of the necessary state approvals for both soybeans and cotton, and expects to have the rest before planting. The company has provided extensive, ongoing customer training and expects customers will have an outstanding experience with the Roundup Ready® Xtend crop system. 

Cotton had a strong start in the first quarter with increased acres in Australia. In the U.S., Bollgard II® XtendFlex™ cotton area is expected to exceed 4 million acres this year. Additionally, this season the company looks forward to an introductory release of Bollgard 3 XtendFlex™ cotton, with a full-scale launch planned for 2018. This is the first cotton product ever to combine three modes of action for both insect control and weed control. The company expects 2017 to be the third consecutive year of share growth in U.S. cotton. 

Moving beyond seeds, Monsanto continues to see major advancements in its Climate FieldView™ platform as the business and platform continues to evolve. The company recently released four new product enhancements for 2017 and these upgrades, together with outstanding demand for FieldView Drive and FieldView Plus, set the company up to reach its goal of 25 million paid acres. Simultaneously, the company expects to add several more partners to the platform in the coming year.

Agricultural Productivity Segment Detail

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(A) EBIT is defined as earnings (loss) before interest and taxes. Interest and taxes are recorded on a total company basis. We do not record these items at the segment level.

The Agricultural Productivity segment consists of the crop protection products and lawn-and-garden herbicide products.

Though glyphosate volumes were up in the first quarter, net sales for the Agricultural Productivity segment in the first three months of fiscal 2017 were $802 million, reflecting glyphosate pricing headwinds that are expected to continue into the second quarter as the current global pricing is lower than the prior comparable period. As a partial offset to EBIT, the company recently signed an agreement to sell its Latitude wheat fungicide business for $140 million and expects to receive an EBIT benefit of approximately $85 million in this segment in the second quarter. 

Moving beyond the first quarter, the company continues to focus on the launch of Xtendimax™ herbicide with VaporGrip™ Technology.

1.This press release uses the non-GAAP financial measures of gross profit, operating expenses, net income (loss) attributable to Monsanto Company and diluted earnings per share (EPS), each on an ongoing basis (collectively, “Ongoing Financial Measures”), and EBIT and free cash flow. The Ongoing Financial Measures and EBIT are intended to supplement investor's understanding of our operating performance. The free cash flow measure is intended to supplement investor's understanding of our liquidity. They are different from and not intended to replace gross profit, operating expenses, other expense, net, net income (loss) attributable to Monsanto Company, diluted EPS, cash flows, financial position or comprehensive income, and they are not measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. 

Our Ongoing Financial Measures exclude certain items that we do not consider part of ongoing operations. We believe that our Ongoing Financial Measures presented with these adjustments are useful to investors as they best reflect our ongoing performance and business operations during the periods presented and are also useful to investors for comparative purposes. In addition, management uses the Ongoing Financial Measures as a guide in its budgeting and long-range planning processes, and the ongoing EPS financial measure is used as a guide in determining incentive compensation.

EBIT is defined as earnings (loss) before interest and taxes. Earnings (loss) is intended to mean net income (loss) attributable to Monsanto Company as presented in the Statements of Consolidated Operations under GAAP. EBIT is an operating performance measure for our two business segments. We believe that EBIT is useful to investors and management to demonstrate the operational profitability of our segments by excluding interest and taxes, which are generally accounted for across the entire company on a consolidated basis. EBIT is also one of the measures used by management to determine resource allocations within the company.

We define free cash flow as the total of net cash provided or required by operating activities and net cash provided or required by investing activities. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. We believe that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of the ability of our business to generate cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to our shareowners through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow is also used as one of the performance measures in determining incentive compensation. 

The following tables reconcile GAAP as-reported financial measures to Non-GAAP financial measures.
