ITEM 5.02.DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS.

Comerica Incorporated (“Comerica”) previously announced, on a Form 8-K dated October 13, 2016, that it had amended and restated its Supplemental Retirement Income Account Plan (formerly known as the Amended and Restated Benefit Equalization Plan for Employees of Comerica Incorporated) (the “SRIA”), effective January 1, 2017. On January 24, 2017, the Board of Directors further amended and restated the SRIA, effective January 1, 2017, to make a correction to the plan that was approved on October 13, 2016. When the SRIA was amended on October 13, 2016, a provision that was in the former version of that plan was inadvertently removed. That provision provided for reductions to benefits payable prior to age 55 and provides that if the benefit commencement date under the SRIA is earlier than age 55, early retirement age under Comerica’s tax qualified retirement plan, then such excess payment under the SRIA shall be further reduced by 5/12 percent for each month (or fraction thereof) from the commencement of the benefit under the SRIA until the date on which such participant would attain age 55.

With the amendment approved on January 24, 2017, this provision has been reinserted into the SRIA, effective January 1, 2017.

Of Comerica’s named executive officers, Mr. Babb, Mr. Duprey and Mr. Farmer participate in the SRIA. The description of the SRIA included in the Form 8-K dated October 13, 2016 is incorporated herein.

This summary of the amended SRIA is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the amended SRIA, a copy of which is being filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1.
