2016 Fourth Quarter Investor Presentation January 30, 2017 Exhibit 99.1  

2 This presentation contains certain forward-looking statements as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are subject to the “safe harbor” created by those sections. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as “outlook,” “expects,” “intends,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “targets,” “estimates,” “will,” “should,” “may” or words of similar meaning, but these words are not the exclusive means of identifying forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions, and are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. As a result, actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include global political, economic, business, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors and risks, such as: the impact of macroeconomic conditions and whether industry trends we have identified develop as anticipated; retaining existing partners and attracting new partners, concentration of our revenue in a small number of Retail Card partners, promotion and support of our products by our partners, and financial performance of our partners; higher borrowing costs and adverse financial market conditions impacting our funding and liquidity, and any reduction in our credit ratings; our ability to securitize our loans, occurrence of an early amortization of our securitization facilities, loss of the right to service or subservice our securitized loans, and lower payment rates on our securitized loans; our ability to grow our deposits in the future; changes in market interest rates and the impact of any margin compression; effectiveness of our risk management processes and procedures, reliance on models which may be inaccurate or misinterpreted, our ability to manage our credit risk, the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses and the accuracy of the assumptions or estimates used in preparing our financial statements; our ability to offset increases in our costs in retailer share arrangements; competition in the consumer finance industry; our concentration in the U.S. consumer credit market; our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services; our ability to realize the value of strategic investments; reductions in interchange fees; fraudulent activity; cyber-attacks or other security breaches; failure of third parties to provide various services that are important to our operations; our transition to a replacement third-party vendor to manage the technology platform for our online retail deposits; disruptions in the operations of our computer systems and data centers; international risks and compliance and regulatory risks and costs associated with international operations; alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of others and our ability to protect our intellectual property; litigation and regulatory actions; damage to our reputation; our ability to attract, retain and motivate key officers and employees; tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions and state sales tax rules and regulations; a material indemnification obligation to GE under the tax sharing and separation agreement with GE if we cause the split-off from GE or certain preliminary transactions to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment or in the case of certain significant transfers of our stock following the split-off; obligations associated with being an independent public company; regulation, supervision, examination and enforcement of our business by governmental authorities, the impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the impact of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s regulation of our business; changes to our methods of offering our CareCredit products; impact of capital adequacy rules and liquidity requirements; restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock, and restrictions that limit Synchrony Bank’s ability to pay dividends to us; regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection; use of third-party vendors and ongoing third-party business relationships; and failure to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws. For the reasons described above, we caution you against relying on any forward-looking statements, which should also be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included elsewhere in this presentation and in our public filings, including in Synchrony Financial’s (the “Company”) Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for our most recently completed fiscal quarter and under the heading “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed on February 25, 2016. You should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all of the risks, uncertainties, or potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause our current expectations or beliefs to change. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as otherwise may be required by law. Non-GAAP Measures We present certain capital ratios. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, calculated on a fully phased-in basis, is a preliminary estimate reflecting management’s interpretation of the final Basel III capital rules adopted in July 2013 by the Federal Reserve Board, which have not been fully implemented, and our estimate and interpretations are subject to, among other things, ongoing regulatory review and implementation guidance. This ratio is not currently required by regulators to be disclosed, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP measure. We believe this capital ratio is a useful measure to investors because it is widely used by analysts and regulators to assess the capital position of financial services companies, although this ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The reconciliation of our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, calculated on a fully phased-in basis, to the comparable GAAP component at December 31, 2016 is included at the end of this presentation in “Appendix-Non-GAAP Reconciliations.” We also present a measure we refer to as “tangible common equity” in this presentation. Tangible common equity itself is not a measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe tangible common equity is a more meaningful measure to investors of the net asset value of the Company. The reconciliation of tangible common equity, to total equity reported in accordance with GAAP is included at the end of this presentation in “Appendix-Non-GAAP Reconciliations.” We refer to “managed-basis” as presenting certain loan performance measures as if loans sold by us to our securitization trusts were never sold and derecognized in our GAAP financial statements. We believe it is useful to consider these performance measures on a managed-basis for 2009 when comparing to similar GAAP measures in later years since we serviced the securitized and owned loans, and related accounts, in the same manner without regard to ownership of the loans. The reconciliation of the managed-basis loan performance measures in this presentation to the comparable GAAP measures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 is included at the end of this presentation in “Appendix-Non-GAAP Reconciliations.” Disclaimers

Appendix  

28 Non-GAAP Reconciliation We present certain capital ratios. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, calculated on a fully phased-in basis, is a preliminary estimate reflecting management’s interpretation of the final Basel III capital rules adopted in July 2013 by the Federal Reserve Board, which have not been fully implemented, and our estimate and interpretations are subject to, among other things, ongoing regulatory review and implementation guidance. This ratio is not currently required by regulators to be disclosed, and therefore is considered a non-GAAP measure. We believe this capital ratio is a useful measure to investors because it is widely used by analysts and regulators to assess the capital position of financial services companies, although this ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
