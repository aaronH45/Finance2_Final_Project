  1.   Board Appointments; Leadership Structure and Related Agreements.     

(a) Board Appointments 

(i) The Company agrees that the Board and all applicable committees of the Board shall take all necessary actions, effective immediately following the execution of this Agreement, to (A) accept the resignations tendered by Michael J. Jandernoa, Gerald K. Kunkle, Jr., Herman Morris, Jr., and Shlomo Yanai as directors of the Company, who the Company hereby represents have submitted, or shall no later than the date hereof submit, letters of resignation to the Board that will become effective immediately prior to the appointment of their respective successors to the Board, and (B) nominate and appoint Jeffrey C. Smith (the "Starboard Appointee"), Bradley A. Alford and Jeffrey B. Kindler (the "Independent Appointees" and together with the Starboard Appointee and the Additional Independent Appointees (as defined below), the "Appointed Directors") as directors of the Company. 

(ii) Starboard shall also have the right, following the execution of this Agreement, to recommend two (2) additional independent directors (when appointed, the "Additional Independent Appointees") for appointment to the Board. The Additional Independent Appointees must (A) be independent of Starboard (for the avoidance of doubt, the nomination by Starboard of any person to serve on the board of another company shall not (in and of itself) cause such person not to be deemed independent of Starboard), (B) qualify as "independent" pursuant to New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") listing standards, (C) have the relevant financial and business experience to be a director of the Company, and (D) satisfy the publicly disclosed guidelines and policies with respect to service on the Board (in the case of each of (A) through (D), as reasonably determined by the Nominating & Governance Committee). The Nominating & Governance Committee shall make its determination and recommendation regarding whether any candidate recommended by Starboard as an Additional Independent Appointee meets the foregoing criteria within five (5) business days after (1) such Additional Independent Appointee candidate has submitted to the Company the documentation required by Section 1(g)(v) and (2) representatives of the Board have conducted customary interview(s) of such Additional Independent Appointee candidate. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to conduct any interview(s) contemplated by this Section 1(a)(ii) as promptly as practicable, but in any case, assuming reasonable availability of the applicable Additional Independent Appointee candidate, within ten (10) business days, after Starboard's submission of such Additional Independent Appointee candidate. In the event the Nominating & Governance Committee does not accept an Additional Independent Appointee candidate recommended by Starboard, Starboard shall have the right to recommend further Additional Independent Appointee candidate(s) whose appointment shall be subject to the Nominating & Governance Committee recommending such person in accordance with the procedures described above. Upon the recommendation of an Additional Independent Appointee by the Nominating & Governance Committee, the Board shall vote on the appointment of such Additional Independent Appointee to the Board no later than five (5) business days after the Nominating & Governance Committee's recommendation of such Additional Independent Appointee and shall take all necessary actions to appoint such Additional Independent Appointee to the Board; provided, however, that if the Board does not appoint any candidate recommended by Starboard as an Additional Independent Appointee to the Board pursuant to this Section 1(a)(ii), the Parties shall continue to follow the procedures of this Section 1(a)(ii) until two Additional Independent Appointees have been appointed to the Board. Effective upon the appointment of an Additional Independent Appointee(s) to the Board, such Additional Independent Appointee(s) will be considered an Independent Appointee for all purposes of this Agreement. 

(iii) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Ellen Hoffing shall execute and deliver to the Company an advance irrevocable resignation letter pursuant to which she shall resign from the Board and all applicable committees thereof effective immediately prior to effectiveness of the appointment of the second Additional Independent Appointee (such time, the "Resignation Date"). At the Resignation Date, the Board and all applicable committees of the Board shall take all necessary actions to accept the resignation of Ellen Hoffing from the Board and all applicable committees thereof. 

(iv) The Company agrees that (i) the Board shall nominate the following individuals, and shall only nominate the following individuals, for election to the Board at the Company's 2017 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (the "2017 Annual General Meeting") for terms expiring at the Company's 2018 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (the "2018 Annual General Meeting") and subject to their consent to serve: Laurie Brlas, Gary Cohen, John Hendrickson, Donal O'Connor, Geoffrey Parker, Theodore Samuels, and if both Additional Independent Appointees have not yet been appointed to the Board, Ellen Hoffing (collectively, the "Continuing Directors"), the Starboard Appointee (provided, that Starboard satisfies the Minimum Ownership Threshold (as defined below) at all times from the date of this Agreement until completion of the 2017 Annual General Meeting), each Independent Appointee and, if one or both of the Additional Independent Appointees have been appointed to the Board, then such Additional Independent Appointee(s), and (ii) the Company shall recommend, support and solicit proxies for the Starboard Appointee, each Independent Appointee, and, if applicable, the Additional Independent Appointee, at the 2017 Annual General Meeting in the same manner as it recommends, supports, and solicits proxies for the election of the Continuing Directors. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the 2017 Annual General Meeting no later than May 20, 2017. 

(v) If any Appointed Director (or any Starboard Replacement Director (as defined below)) is unable or unwilling to serve as a director and ceases to be a director, resigns as a director or is removed as a director prior to the expiration of the Standstill Period (as defined below), and at such time Starboard beneficially owns at least the lesser of 3% of the Company's then outstanding Ordinary Shares and 4,301,342 Ordinary Shares (subject to adjustment for stock splits, reclassifications, combinations and similar adjustments) (such amount the "Minimum Ownership Threshold"), Starboard shall have the ability to recommend a substitute person(s) in accordance with this Section 1(a)(iv) (any such replacement nominee, when appointed to the Boad, shall be referred to as a "Starboard Replacement Director"). Any Starboard Replacement Director must (A) be reasonably acceptable to the Board (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld), (B) qualify as "independent" pursuant to NYSE listing standards, (C) have the relevant financial and business experience to be a director of the Company, (D) satisfy the publicly disclosed guidelines and policies with respect to service on the Board and (E) in the case of a Starboard Replacement Director who is replacing an Independent Appointee (or any replacement thereof), be independent of Starboard (for the avoidance of doubt, the nomination by Starboard of such person to serve on the board of any other company shall not (in and of itself) cause such person to not be deemed independent of Starboard). Any Starboard Replacement Director who is replacing the Starboard Appointee (or any replacement thereof) and who is an employee of Starboard will be approved and appointed to the Board no later than (5) five business days following the submission of all completed documentation required by Section 1(g)(v) so long as such Starboard Replacement Director qualifies as "independent" pursuant to the NYSE listing standards and satisfies (D) in the preceding sentence. The Nominating & Governance Committee shall make its determination and recommendation regarding whether such Starboard Replacement Director (other than the Starboard Appointee, who is covered by the prior sentence) meets the foregoing criteria within five (5) business days after (1) such nominee has submitted to the Company the documentation required by Section 1(g)(v) and (2) representatives of the Board have conducted customary interview(s) of such nominee. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to conduct any interview(s) contemplated by this Section 1(a)(v) as promptly as practicable, but in any case, assuming reasonable availability of the nominee, within ten (10) business days after Starboard's submission of such nominee. In the event the Nominating & Governance Committee does not accept a person recommended by Starboard as the Starboard Replacement Director, Starboard shall have the right to recommend additional substitute person(s) whose appointment shall be subject to the Nominating & Governance Committee recommending such person in accordance with the procedures described above. Upon the recommendation of a Starboard Replacement Director nominee by the Nominating & Governance Committee, the Board shall vote on the appointment of such Starboard Replacement Director to the Board no later than five (5) business days after the Nominating & Governance Committee recommendation of such Starboard Replacement Director; provided, however, that if the Board does not appoint such Starboard Replacement Director to the Board pursuant to this Section 1(a)(v), the Parties shall continue to follow the procedures of this Section 1(a)(v) until a Starboard Replacement Director is elected to the Board. Subject to NYSE rules applicable law, upon a Starboard Replacement Director's appointment to the Board, the Board and all applicable committees of the Board shall take all necessary actions to appoint such Starboard Replacement Director to any applicable committee of the Board of which the replaced director was a member immediately prior to such director's resignation. Subject to NYSE rules and applicable law, until such time as any Starboard Replacement Director is appointed to any applicable committee, one of the other Appointed Directors (as designated by Starboard) will serve as an interim member of such applicable committee. Subject to Section 1(a)(iv), any Starboard Replacement Director designated pursuant to this Section 1(a)(v) replacing an Appointed Director prior to the 2017 Annual General Meeting shall stand for election at the 2017 Annual General Meeting together with the Company's other nominees. 

(vi) During the period commencing with the date hereof through the expiration of the Standstill Period, the Board shall not seek shareholder approval to increase the size of the Board to more than eleven (11) directors, unless Starboard consents in writing to any proposal to increase the size of the Board.
