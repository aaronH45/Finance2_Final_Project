HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED REPORTS 2016 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS INCLUDING 19% INCREASE IN NET INCOME

Fourth Quarter Represents Strong End to Historic and Transformational Year

COLUMBUS, Ohio – Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN; www.huntington.com) reported net income for the 2016 fourth quarter of $212 million, or a 19% increase from the year-ago quarter. Earnings per common share for the 2016 fourth quarter were $0.18, down 14% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding approximately $0.06 per common share after tax of FirstMerit acquisition-related net expenses, adjusted earnings per common share were $0.24. Return on average assets was 0.84%, while return on average tangible common equity was 11.4%. Total revenue increased 39% over the year-ago quarter.

2016 full-year net income was $685 million, a decrease of 1% from the prior year. Earnings per common share for the year were $0.67, down 17% from the prior year. FirstMerit acquisition-related expenses totaled $282 million pretax, or $0.20 per common share after tax. Return on average assets for the full year was 0.82%, while return on average tangible common equity was 10.2%. Total revenue increased 18% over the prior year.

“We are very pleased with our strong close to 2016,” said Steve Steinour, chairman, president and CEO. “2016 performance demonstrated continued progress toward achieving our long-term financial goals. We delivered positive operating leverage for the fourth consecutive year. We also executed our balance sheet optimization strategy, in which we chose to shrink the balance sheet in order to replenish our capital ratios more quickly. This included the successful completion of a $1.5 billion auto loan securitization within the 2016 fourth quarter, demonstrating strong investor demand for our superior automobile loan production quality.”

“This was a historic year for the company as we celebrated the 150th anniversary of our founding and completed our largest-ever acquisition, a transformational transaction,” Steinour said. "Integration of FirstMerit continues to go well, and remains on track for branch conversion in mid-February. Our progress within the fourth quarter included the completion of our required divestiture of certain branches and associated relationships.”

“Taking care of and looking out for our customers are at the heart of what we do. They are also good for business. We’re proud that this strategy and our commitment to delivering superior customer service continue to be recognized. During the fourth quarter, we were recognized as a top Midwest region ranking in the J.D. Power Small Business Banking Satisfaction Study. Huntington also was the recipient of the 2016 Greenwich Excellence Award for Wealth Management and Personal Investment Services, and our commercial, middle market and small business customers recognized us within the Greenwich Best Brand Awards for ease of doing business and as a Best Brand for trust earned,” Steinour said. “Huntington also rated among the Best Places to Work for LGBT Equality for the fourth consecutive year within the 2017 Human Rights Campaign Foundation Corporate Equality Index.”

Full-year 2016 highlights compared with 2015:

•Closing of the acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation (FirstMerit), which added approximately $26.8 billion of total assets, $15.5 billion of total loans and leases, and $21.2 billion of total deposits 

•FirstMerit integration proceeding as planned; branch conversion and consolidations scheduled for 2017 first quarter, and required branch divestiture completed during 2016 fourth quarter

See Pages 8-10 and 21-23 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

Note: 2016 results reflect inclusion of FirstMerit since August 16, 2016.

Fully-taxable equivalent (FTE) net interest income for the 2016 fourth quarter increased $242 million, or 48%, from the 2015 fourth quarter. This reflected the benefit from the $26.5 billion, or 41%, increase in average earning assets partially coupled with a 16 basis point improvement in the FTE net interest margin (NIM) to 3.25%. Average earning asset growth included a $16.6 billion, or 33%, increase in average loans and leases and a $7.9 billion, or 54%, increase in average securities. The NIM expansion reflected a 23 basis point increase related to the mix and yield of earning assets and a 0 basis point increase in the benefit from noninterest-bearing funds, partially offset by a 7 basis point increase in funding costs. FTE net interest income during the 2016 fourth quarter included $42 million, or approximately 18 basis points, of purchase accounting impact.

Compared to the 2016 third quarter, FTE net interest income increased $112 million, or 18%. Average earning assets increased $11.8 billion, or 15%, sequentially, while the NIM increased 7 basis points. The increase in the NIM reflected a 8 basis point increase related to the mix and yield of earning assets, partially offset by a 2 basis point decrease in the benefit from noninterest-bearing funds. The purchase accounting impact on the net interest margin was approximately 18 basis points in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to approximately 11 basis points in the prior quarter.

The primary driver of all increases was the mid-quarter acquisition of FirstMerit during the 2016 third quarter.

Under our previously-announced balance sheet optimization strategy, $1.5 billion of automobile loans were securitized, and $0.9 billion of non-relationship C&I and CRE loans were sold during the 2016 fourth quarter.

Reported noninterest expense increased $11 million, or 2%, from the 2016 third quarter. Other expense increased $43 million, or 88%, from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting the previously-mentioned $40 million contribution, as well as the $6 million benefit related to the extinguishment of trust preferred securities in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to a $4 million benefit in the prior quarter. Equipment expense increased $8 million, or 19%, primarily reflecting $20 million of acquisition-related Significant Items in the 2016 fourth quarter. Net occupancy expense increased $19 million, or 46%, reflecting a full quarter's impact of the FirstMerit acquisition. Personnel expense decreased $45 million, or 11%, as a result of an $82 million decrease in acquisition-related Significant Items, partially offset by a full quarter's impact of the FirstMerit acquisition. Professional services decreased $24 million, or 51%, due to a $25 million decrease in acquisition-related Significant Items.

Credit Quality

(1)Other nonperforming assets includes certain impaired investment securities.

(2)Total NALs as a % of total loans and leases.

(3)Total NPAs as a % of sum of loans and leases and net other real estate.

(4)Excludes nonaccruing troubled debt restructured home equity loans previously transferred to held-for-sale for the quarters ending December 31, 2015 through June 30, 2016.

See Pages 13-18 and 26-31 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

Overall asset quality remains strong, with modest volatility. Overall consumer credit metrics, led by the Home Equity and Residential portfolios, continue to show an improving trend, while the Commercial portfolios continue to experience some quarter-to-quarter volatility based on the absolute low level of problem loans. The FirstMerit portfolio quality, composition, and geographic distribution were similar to the legacy Huntington portfolio. The only new loan classification is the RV / marine portfolio.

Nonaccrual loans and leases (NALs) of $423 million represented 0.63% of total loans and leases, down from 0.74% a year ago. The decrease in the NAL ratio reflected a 14% year-over-year increase in NALs, more than offset by the impact of the 33% year-over-year increase in total loans. Nonperforming assets (NPAs) of $481 million represented 0.72% of total loans and leases and OREO, down from 0.79% a year ago. The NAL ratio increased 2 basis points from the prior quarter, while the NPA ratio remained unchanged.

The provision for credit losses increased to $75 million in the 2016 fourth quarter compared to $36 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. Net charge-offs (NCOs) increased $22 million, or 99%, to $44 million. NCOs represented an annualized 0.26% of average loans and leases in the current quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter but up from 0.18% in the year-ago quarter. Commercial charge-offs continued to be positively impacted by recoveries in the CRE portfolio and broader continued successful workout strategies, while consumer charge-offs remained within our expected range. We continue to be pleased with the net charge-off performance across the entire portfolio, as we remain below our targeted range of 0.35% to 0.55%.

The period-end allowance for credit losses (ACL) as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 1.10% from 1.33% a year ago, while the ACL as a percentage of period-end total NALs decreased to 174% from 180%. 

12

The decline in the coverage ratios is primarily a function of the purchase accounting impact associated with FirstMerit.

Capital

Table 13 – Capital Ratios – Balance Sheet Optimization Strategy Drives Linked-Quarter Increase in Regulatory Capital Ratios

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)December 31, 2016 figures are estimated and are presented on a Basel III basis, including the standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets.

See Pages 19-20 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.14% at December 31, 2016, down 68 basis points from a year ago. The regulatory Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio was 9.53% at December 31, 2016, down from 9.79% at December 31, 2015. The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.89% compared to 10.53% at December 31, 2015.

All capital ratios were impacted by the $1.3 billion of goodwill created and the issuance of $2.8 billion of common stock as part of the FirstMerit acquisition. The regulatory Tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios benefited from the issuance of $400 million and $200 million of Class D preferred equity during the 2016 first and second quarters, respectively, and the issuance of $100 million of Class C preferred equity during the 2016 third quarter in exchange for FirstMerit preferred equity in conjunction with the acquisition. The total risk-based capital ratio was impacted by the repurchase of $40 million of trust preferred securities during the 2016 fourth quarter and $20 million of trust preferred securities during the 2016 third quarter, both of which were executed under the de minimis clause of the Federal Reserve's CCAR rules. In addition, $5 million of trust preferred securities were acquired in the FirstMerit acquisition and subsequently were redeemed. There were no common shares repurchased during 2016.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes in the 2016 fourth quarter was $59 million and $56 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. The effective tax rates for the 2016 fourth quarter and 2015 fourth quarter were 21.8% and 23.8%, respectively. 

At December 31, 2016, we had a net federal deferred tax asset of $90 million and a net state deferred tax asset of $42 million.

Expectations – 2017

“Looking forward into 2017, we are optimistic that improved consumer confidence and jobs growth will translate into overall economic growth in the markets where we do business. Operationally, we expect to realize the full financial benefits of integration completion within the second half of the year, meeting our commitment for cost savings. We are driving revenue synergies and organic revenue growth, leveraging our expanded footprint and customer base,” Steinour said. “We will see minor benefits from the Federal Reserve’s December interest rate action, and any additional rate increases in 2017 would be additive to our bottom line.”

We expect full-year revenue growth, given the FirstMerit acquisition, to be in excess of 20%. While continuing to proactively invest in the franchise, we will manage the expense base with respect to our annual goal to deliver positive operating leverage. We expect to implement all FirstMerit-related cost savings by the 2017 third quarter.

We expect average balance sheet growth, driven largely by the FirstMerit acquisition, to be in excess of 20%. On a period-end basis, we expect loan growth of 4% to 6%.

Overall, asset quality metrics are expected to remain near current levels, although moderate quarterly volatility also is expected, given the quickly evolving macroeconomic conditions, commodities and currency market volatility, 

13

and current low level of problem assets and credit costs. We anticipate NCOs will remain below our long-term normalized range of 35 to 55 basis points, while provision expense will continue to normalize.

The effective tax rate for 2017 is expected to be in the range of 24% to 27%, excluding Significant Items.

Basis of Presentation

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This document contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington’s results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this document, conference call slides, or the Form 8-K related to this document, all of which can be found on Huntington’s website at www.huntington-ir.com.

Annualized Data

Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an “annualized” basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and deposit growth rates, as well as net charge-off percentages, are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.

Fully-Taxable Equivalent Interest Income and Net Interest Margin

Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.

Earnings per Share Equivalent Data

Significant income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of the company’s financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of Significant Items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying an effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is disclosed separately, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.

Rounding

Please note that columns of data in this document may not add due to rounding.

Significant Items

From time to time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items judged by Management to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by Management at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature. We refer to such items as “Significant Items”. Most often, these Significant Items result from factors originating outside the company – e.g., regulatory actions/assessments, windfall gains, changes in accounting principles, one-time tax assessments/refunds, litigation actions, etc. In other cases they may result from Management decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of business – e.g., merger/restructuring charges, recapitalization actions, goodwill impairment, etc.

Even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not define a Significant Item. For example, changes in the provision for credit losses, gains/losses from investment activities, asset valuation write-downs, etc., reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as a Significant Item.

Management believes the disclosure of “Significant Items”, when appropriate, aids analysts/investors in better understanding corporate performance and trends so that they can ascertain which of such items, if any, they may wish to include/exclude from their analysis of the company’s performance - i.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from their expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust their estimates of future performance accordingly. To this end, Management has adopted a practice of listing “Significant Items” in its external disclosure documents (e.g., earnings press releases, quarterly performance discussions, investor presentations, Forms 10-Q and 10-K).

15

“Significant Items” for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance. A number of items could materially impact these periods, including those described in Huntington’s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other factors described from time to time in Huntington’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
