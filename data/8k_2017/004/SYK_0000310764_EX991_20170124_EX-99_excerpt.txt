In addition, we executed well on acquisitions and delivered leveraged adjusted earnings gains. We enter 2017 with good momentum across our businesses and look forward to building on this success."

Sales Analysis

Consolidated net sales of $3.2 billion and $11.3 billion increased 16.2% and 13.9% as reported in the quarter and full year and 16.8% and 14.3% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 0.6% and 0.4%. Excluding the 10.1% and 7.9% impact of acquisitions, net sales increased 6.7% and 6.4% in constant currency, including 8.2% and 7.8% from increased unit volumes partially offset by 1.5% and 1.4% in lower prices. The acquisitions of Sage Products LLC and Physio-Control International, Inc., contributed $258 million and $740 million to our consolidated net sales in the quarter and full year.

Orthopaedics net sales of $1.2 billion and $4.4 billion increased 5.3% and 4.7% as reported in the quarter and full year and 5.7% and 5.1% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 0.4% in both periods. Excluding the 0.4% and 0.3% impact of acquisitions, net sales increased 5.3% and 4.8% in constant currency, including 7.8% and 6.9% from increased unit volumes partially offset by 2.5% and 2.1% in lower prices.

MedSurg net sales of $1.4 billion and $4.9 billion increased 31.1% and 25.6% as reported in the quarter and full year and 32.1% and 26.3% in constant currency in the quarter and full year, as foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 1.0% and 0.7%. Excluding the 23.8% and 19.1% impact of acquisitions, net sales increased 8.3% and 7.2% in constant currency, including 8.9% and 7.8% from increased unit volumes partially offset by 0.6% in lower prices in both periods.

Neurotechnology and Spine net sales of $526 million and $2.0 billion increased 8.7% and 9.9% as reported in the quarter and full year and 8.6% and 9.8% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by 0.1% in both periods. Excluding the 1.9% and 1.4% impact of acquisitions, net sales increased 6.7% and 8.4% in constant currency, including 8.1% and 9.8% from increased unit volumes partially offset by 1.4% in lower prices in both periods.

Earnings Analysis

Reported net earnings decreased 2.3% in the quarter to $510 million and increased 14.5% to $1.6 billion in the full year. Reported net earnings per diluted share decreased 2.9% in the quarter to $1.34 and increased 15.1% to $4.35 in the full year. Reported net earnings includes charges for the amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring-related activities, Rejuvenate and ABG II recall, acquisition and integration related activities and certain tax matters. The effect of each of these matters on reported net earnings and net earnings per diluted share appears in the reconciliation of actual results to adjusted results. Excluding the impact of these charges increases gross profit margin in the quarter from 66.1% to 66.3% and for the full year from 66.2% to 66.6% and increases operating income margin in the quarter from 20.9% to 27.7% and for the full year from 19.1% to 25.5%.

Excluding the impact of the items described above, adjusted net earnings(2) of $675 million and $2.2 billion increased 14.2% and 12.6%, in the quarter and full year. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share(1) of $1.78 and $5.80 increased 14.1% and 13.3% in the quarter and full year.

2017 Outlook 

We expect 2017 organic sales growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% and adjusted net earnings per diluted share(3) to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.45 in the first quarter and $6.35 to $6.45 in the full year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the first quarter and full year to be negatively impacted by approximately 1.0% and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in the first quarter and $0.10 to $0.12 in the full year. On January 1, 2017 we adopted the updated accounting guidance required by ASU 2016-09 Stock Compensation. If our share price remains at current levels and stock option exercises remain at historical levels we expect the changes in accounting for excess tax benefits on stock compensation to positively impact net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.07 to $0.09 in the full year, about half of which we expect in the first quarter.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; cost of sales excluding specified items; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted operating income; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; and adjusted net earnings per diluted share. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. 

To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. 

Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, operating income, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures:
