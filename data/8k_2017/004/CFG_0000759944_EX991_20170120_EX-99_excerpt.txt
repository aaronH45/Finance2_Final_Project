Fourth Quarter 2016 vs. Fourth Quarter 2015  

Key Highlights  

   •    

Fourth quarter results include a 28% increase in net income available to common stockholders, highlighted by strong revenue growth of 11%, driven by strength in net interest income with 8% average loan growth and a 13 basis point increase in net interest margin as well as noninterest income growth of 4%.  

   •    

Year-over-year operating leverage of 6.1%, a 358 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio and a 168 basis point improvement in ROTCE, reflecting focus on top line growth and strong expense discipline, while reinvesting in technology and business initiatives to drive future growth.*  

Results  

   •    

Total revenue of $1.4 billion increased $131 million, or 11%, reflecting solid net interest income and noninterest income growth.  

   •    

Net interest income increased 13%, reflecting 8% average loan growth and a 13 basis point improvement in net interest margin.  

   •    

Net interest margin of 2.90% reflects improved loan yields, driven by higher rates and balance sheet optimization initiatives, partially offset by a reduction in investment portfolio yields and higher deposit costs.  

   •    

Noninterest income increased 4%, driven by strength in capital markets, mortgage banking, other income and foreign exchange and letter of credit fees. These results were partially offset by lower card fees, including the impact of the card reward accounting change, a reduction in securities gains and lower trust and investment services fees and service charges and fees.  

   •    

Noninterest expense increased 5%, driven by growth in salaries and employee benefits largely related to higher incentive compensation tied to revenue, as well as an increase in other expense.  

   •    

Provision for credit losses of $102 million increased $11 million, or 12%, reflecting higher net charge-offs in commercial, largely commodities-related credits and an increase in retail given a one-time methodology change in auto.  

   •

   •    

NPLs to total loans and leases ratio of 0.97% improved from 1.07%, as an underlying reduction in retail nonperforming loans more than offset an increase in commercial nonperforming loans, largely commodities-related borrowers. Allowance coverage of NPLs of 118% compares with 115%.  

   •    

Net charge-offs of 39 basis points of loans increased eight basis points, reflecting an increase in both commercial and retail categories and included a methodology change in auto, which resulted in a $7 million, or 3 basis point, impact.

Net interest income of $986 million increased $41 million, or 4%, from third quarter 2016, given 2% average loan growth and a six basis point improvement in net interest margin. Net interest margin improvement reflects improved commercial and consumer loan yields, including the benefit of an increase in LIBOR, and lower pay-fixed swap costs, partially offset by the impact of an increase in investment portfolio balances as well as the impact of higher deposit and borrowing costs.  

Compared to fourth quarter 2015, net interest income increased $116 million, or 13%, reflecting 8% average loan growth and a 13 basis point improvement in net interest margin. Results were driven by improved loan yields, reflecting the benefit of higher rates and balance sheet optimization initiatives, as well as lower pay-fixed swap costs. Results also reflect lower investment portfolio yields, which included a reduction in Federal Reserve Bank stock dividends, and higher deposit and borrowing costs.

1) Other income includes bank-owned life insurance and other income.  

Noninterest income of $377 million decreased $58 million, or 13%, from third quarter 2016 levels that reflected the benefit of the $72 million TDR Transaction gain in other income. Compared with Adjusted third quarter results*, fourth quarter noninterest income of $377 million increased $9 million, or 2%, largely reflecting higher other income and mortgage banking fees. Other income increased $5 million, driven by higher leasing and interest rate products income. Mortgage banking fees increased $3 million, reflecting improved mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) valuations and modestly higher origination volumes partially offset by lower loan sale gains. Foreign exchange and letter of credit fees increased $2 million and service charges and fees were relatively flat compared to the prior quarter. Capital markets fees remained stable with robust third

 quarter 2016 levels driven by strong loan-syndications activity. Card fees declined $2 million given seasonally lower out-of-network ATM transaction fees, and trust and investment services fees declined $3 million, reflecting continued shift in product sales toward fee-based business and a reduction in overall sales volume. Securities gains of $3 million were recorded during the quarter compared to no securities gains in the prior quarter.  

Noninterest income increased $15 million, or 4%, from fourth quarter 2015 levels, largely reflecting strength in capital markets and mortgage banking fees partially offset by lower card fees, trust and investment services fees and service charges and fees. Capital markets fees increased $19 million reflecting improved market conditions and further broadening of our capabilities. Mortgage banking fees increased $16 million, reflecting strength in applications and secondary origination volumes and an increase in MSR valuations. Other income increased $5 million driven by higher interest rate product revenue. Card fees decreased $10 million, largely reflecting the card reward accounting change impact. Trust and investment services fees decreased $5 million as the benefit of higher sales volume was more than offset by the impact of a shift in product sales toward fee-based business. Service charges and fees decreased $3 million, largely reflecting lower loan prepayment fees. Securities gains decreased by $7 million.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Noninterest expense of $847 million decreased $20 million, or 2%, from third quarter 2016 levels that included $36 million of notable items largely tied to salaries and employee benefits, outside services and other expense. Compared with Adjusted third quarter results*, fourth quarter noninterest expense increased $16 million, or 2%, driven by a $9 million increase in other expense largely reflecting higher fraud, legal and regulatory costs, a $4 million increase in outside services, largely tied to increased consumer loan origination and servicing costs and a $4 million increase in equipment expense, reflecting increased vendor contract licenses and maintenance costs. Results also reflect relatively stable salaries and benefits expense, as higher incentive compensation tied to revenue was largely offset by a reduction in benefits.  

Compared with fourth quarter 2015, noninterest expense increased $37 million, or 5%, largely reflecting higher salaries and employee benefits expense, other expense and amortization of software expense partially offset by the card reward accounting change impact and lower outside services expense. Salary and employee benefits expense increased $18 million, reflecting merit increases and higher incentive compensation tied to revenue. Other expense increased $14 million related to higher FDIC

 insurance expense and higher fraud, legal and regulatory costs. Amortization of software expense increased $6 million, driven by technology investments. These increases were partially offset by the card reward accounting change impact in other expense and a $6 million reduction in outside services expense related to lower regulatory costs.  

The effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2016 was 31.9% compared to 30.5% in third quarter 2016, which included benefits from our TOP efficiency initiatives, and 33.4% in fourth quarter 2015.

At the end of fourth quarter 2016, the average effective duration of the securities portfolio increased to 4.3 years, compared with 2.7 years at September 30, 2016 and 3.5 years at December 31, 2015, reflecting the impact of higher long-term rates, which reduced prepayment speeds.  

Period-end loans and leases of $107.7 billion at December 31, 2016 increased $2.2 billion, or 2%, from $105.5 billion at September 30, 2016 and $8.6 billion, or 9%, from $99.0 billion at December 31, 2015. The linked-quarter change was driven by a $1.3 billion increase in commercial loans and leases and a $940 million increase in retail loans. The change from the prior-year period reflects a $5.4 billion increase in commercial loans and leases and a $3.2 billion increase in retail loans.  

Average loans and leases increased $2.5 billion, or 2%, from third quarter 2016, reflecting a $1.3 billion increase in commercial loans and leases and a $1.2 billion increase in retail loans.

As part of the CFG’s 2016 Capital Plan (the “Plan”), during the fourth quarter the company repurchased 6.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of $28.71 per share. Tangible book value per common share of $25.69 decreased 2% versus third quarter 2016 and increased 4% versus fourth quarter 2015. The decrease compared to the prior quarter largely reflects mark-to-market losses on the available for sale securities portfolio of $334 million, which reduced other comprehensive income. The Plan includes the repurchase of up to $690 million of Citizens’ outstanding common stock beginning in third quarter 2016 through second quarter 2017, with $260 million in remaining availability as of December 31, 2016. In accordance with the Plan, the company paid quarterly dividends of $0.12 per share in the third and fourth quarters of 2016, and has declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the first quarter 2017. Future capital actions are subject to consideration and approval by CFG’s Board of Directors.

Overall credit quality continued to improve reflecting growth in lower risk retail loans and modest increases in commercial categories. Nonperforming loans of $1.0 billion decreased $62 million from September 30, 2016, driven by a $53 million decrease in retail, with a reduction in residential mortgage reflecting higher home values and borrowers’ improved ability to repay, and a $9 million decrease in commercial. Compared to December 31, 2015, nonperforming loans and leases decreased $15 million as increases in commercial, largely commodities-related portfolio, were offset by improvements in consumer real-estate secured categories. The nonperforming loans and leases to total loans and leases ratio of 0.97% at December 31, 2016 compares with 1.05% at September 30, 2016 and 1.07% at December 31, 2015.  

Net charge-offs of $104 million increased $21 million from third quarter 2016 levels, driven by a $14 million reduction in recoveries of prior-period charge-offs and the $7 million impact of a one-time methodology change in the auto portfolio. Compared with fourth quarter 2015, net charge-offs increased $27 million, driven by a $19 million increase in commercial, largely tied to commodities-related credits, and the $7 million impact of the methodology change in auto. Fourth quarter 2016 net charge-offs of 39 basis points of average loans and leases compares with 32 basis points in third quarter 2016 and 31 basis points in fourth quarter 2015.  

Allowance for loan and lease losses of $1.2 billion was stable compared to third quarter 2016 and increased $20 million, or 2%, from fourth quarter 2015, largely reflecting continued loan growth.  

Allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases was 1.15% as of December 31, 2016, relatively stable compared with 1.18% as of September 30, 2016 and 1.23% as of December 31, 2015. The allowance for loan and lease losses to nonperforming loans and leases ratio increased slightly to 118% as of December 31, 2016 from 112% as of September 30, 2016 and 115% as of December 31, 2015, given the lower level of nonperforming loans and leases.

Consumer Banking net income of $92 million in fourth quarter 2016 was flat with third quarter 2016, reflecting a $16 million increase in total revenue and relatively stable noninterest expense, largely offset by a $17 million increase in provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $18 million, or 3%, from third quarter 2016, reflecting the benefit of a $1.3 billion increase in average loans led by higher mortgage, student and unsecured retail loans and improved loan yields, partially offset by higher deposit costs. Noninterest income was relatively stable as higher mortgage banking fees were more than offset by lower trust and investment fees and a reduction in card fees, reflecting seasonally lower out-of-network ATM fees.  

Noninterest expense decreased modestly from third quarter 2016 levels that included $7 million of home equity notable items.* Results excluding these items were largely driven by higher fraud and regulatory and legal costs and increased equipment and outside services costs, offsetting lower salaries and benefits, nonperforming asset costs and occupancy expense. Provision for credit losses increased $17 million, largely driven by higher auto net charge-offs, including a $7 million increase related to a methodology change and a $5 million increase related to a reduction in consumer real estate secured recoveries from higher third quarter 2016 levels.  

Compared with fourth quarter 2015, net income increased $25 million, or 37%, reflecting a $75 million increase in total revenue, which more than offset a $25 million increase in noninterest expense and a $9 million increase in provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $74 million, or 13%, driven by a $4.0 billion increase in average loans led by higher student, mortgage and unsecured retail balances as well as improved loan yields and deposit spreads. Noninterest income was relatively stable with fourth quarter 2016 levels, driven by $16 million of higher mortgage banking fees tied to wider gain on sale spreads, secondary volumes and an MSR valuation increase. These results were partially offset by an $8 million card reward accounting change impact and a $5 million decrease in trust and investment fees.

Noninterest expense increased $25 million, or 4%, largely driven by higher fraud, regulatory and legal costs, insurance costs and salaries and benefits expense tied to merit and incentives as well increased amortization of software expense, partially offset by the card reward accounting change impact. Provision for credit losses increased $9 million from fourth quarter 2015, largely driven by higher net charge-offs in auto related to a methodology change.

We approximate that regulatory capital is equivalent to a sustainable target level for common equity tier 1 and then allocate that approximation to the segments based on economic capital.  

Commercial Banking net income of $172 million in fourth quarter 2016 increased $10 million, or 6%, versus third quarter 2016, reflecting a $19 million increase in total revenue, partially offset by a $6 million increase in noninterest expense and relatively stable provision for credit losses. Net interest income of $347 million increased $20 million, or 6%, driven by loan and deposit growth and higher interest rates. Average loans and leases increased $399 million as growth in Mid-corporate and Industry Verticals and Commercial Real Estate was partially offset by a $994 million average decrease related to the transfer of an Asset Finance lease and loan portfolio to non-core at the end of third quarter 2016. Noninterest income remained stable as modest growth in foreign exchange and letter of credit fees and interest rate product fees was offset by a reduction in other income, including lower leasing fees related to the Asset Finance lease and loan portfolio transfer to non-core.  

Noninterest expense increased $6 million, largely reflecting higher operational losses, higher salaries and benefits expense tied to incentive compensation and higher insurance costs, partially offset by lower depreciation expense related to the Asset Finance lease and loan portfolio transfer to non-core. Provision for credit losses was slightly higher.  

Compared to fourth quarter 2015, net income increased $20 million, or 13%, as a $61 million increase in total revenue more than offset a $7 million increase in noninterest expense and a $22 million increase in provision for credit losses.

Average loans and leases increased $4.4 billion, driven by strength in

Provision for credit losses increased $22 million versus fourth quarter 2015, driven by increased losses largely related to higher charge-offs in commodities-related credits.

Key Performance Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

Key Performance Metrics:  

Our management team uses certain key performance metrics (“KPMs”) to gauge our performance and progress over time in achieving our strategic and operational goals and also in comparing our performance against our peers. In connection with our path to becoming an independent public company, we established the following financial targets, in addition to others, as KPMs. These KPMs are utilized by our management in measuring our progress against financial goals and as a tool in helping assess performance for compensation purposes. These KPMs can largely be found in our Registration Statements on Form S-1 and our periodic reports, which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and are supplemented from time to time with additional information in connection with our quarterly earnings releases.  

Our key performance metrics include:  

Return on average tangible common equity (“ROTCE”);  

Return on average total tangible assets (“ROTA”);  

Efficiency ratio;  

Operating leverage; and  

Common equity tier 1 capital ratio (Basel III fully phased-in basis).  

In establishing goals for these KPMs, we determined that they would be measured on a management-reporting basis, or an operating basis, which we refer to externally as “Adjusted” results. We believe that these “Adjusted” results, which exclude restructuring charges, special items and/or notable items, as applicable, provide the best representation of our underlying financial progress toward these goals as they exclude items that our management does not consider indicative of our on-going financial performance. We have consistently shown these metrics on this basis to investors since our initial public offering in September of 2014. Adjusted KPMs are considered non-GAAP financial measures.  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:  

This document contains non-GAAP financial measures. The following tables present reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures. These reconciliations exclude restructuring charges, special items and/or notable items, which are included, where applicable, in the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. Restructuring charges and special items include expenses related to our efforts to improve processes and enhance efficiencies, as well as rebranding, separation from RBS and regulatory expenses. Notable items include certain revenue or expense items that may occur in a reporting period, which management does not consider indicative of on-going financial performance.  

The non-GAAP measures presented below include “noninterest income”, “total revenue”, “noninterest expense”, “pre-provision profit”, “income before income tax expense”, “income tax expense”, “net income”, “net income available to common stockholders”, “other income”, “salaries and employee benefits”, “outside services”, “occupancy”, “equipment expense”, “other operating expense”, and “net income per average common share”, “return on average common equity” and “return on average total assets”.

Citizens Financial Group, Inc.  

We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because these are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe restructuring charges, special items and/or notable items in any period do not reflect the operational performance of the business in that period and, accordingly, it is useful to consider these line items with and without restructuring charges, special items and/or notable items. We believe this presentation also increases comparability of period-to-period results.  

Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for our results as reported under GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements  

This document contains forward-looking statements within the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,” “targets,” “initiatives,” “potentially,” “probably,” “projects,” “outlook” or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” and “could.”  

Forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management, and on information currently available to management. Our statements speak as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ, materially, from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation:  

   •    

negative economic conditions that adversely affect the general economy, housing prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits which may affect, among other things, the level of nonperforming assets, charge-offs and provision expense;  

   •    

the rate of growth in the economy and employment levels, as well as general business and economic conditions;  

   •    

our ability to implement our strategic plan, including the cost savings and efficiency components, and achieve our indicative performance targets;  

   •    

our ability to remedy regulatory deficiencies and meet supervisory requirements and expectations;  

   •    

liabilities and business restrictions resulting from litigation and regulatory investigations;  

   •    

our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;  

   •    

the effect of the current low interest rate environment or changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale;  

   •    

changes in interest rates and market liquidity, as well as the magnitude of such changes, which may reduce interest margins, impact funding sources and affect the ability to originate and distribute financial products in the primary and secondary markets;  

   •    

the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin;  

   •    

financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation and regulation relating to bank products and services;  

   •    

a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks; and  

   •    

management’s ability to identify and manage these and other risks.  

28  

Citizens Financial Group, Inc.  

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or share repurchases will depend on our financial condition, earnings, cash needs, regulatory constraints, capital requirements (including requirements of our subsidiaries), and any other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock, or as to the amount of any such dividends.  

More information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2016.
