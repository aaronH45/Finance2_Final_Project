NEW YORK, February 2, 2017 – Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE / Euronext Paris: PM) today announced its 2016 full-year and fourth-quarter results. 

“Our results last year underscore the strength of our existing business, driven by our world-class brand portfolio, the enormous promise of our Reduced-Risk Products and the tremendous commitment of our talented employees," said André Calantzopoulos, Chief Executive Officer.

"We continue to make considerable progress on the development, assessment and commercialization of our Reduced-Risk Products. Our ambitious goal, to transform PMI from a manufacturer of combustible tobacco products to an RRP-focused company, took a further important step forward at the end of 2016 with the submission of our Modified Risk Tobacco Product Application for our heat-not-burn IQOS product to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration."

“We have entered 2017 confident that our base business fundamentals are in robust shape, and increasingly excited by the tremendous potential of our RRP portfolio to materially accelerate our overall business and contribute significantly to our commitment to generously reward our shareholders in the years to come."

•"North Africa" is defined as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. 

Financial 

•"Operating companies income," or "OCI," is defined as operating income, excluding general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles, plus equity (income)/loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries, net. Management evaluates business segment performance and allocates resources based on OCI. 

•“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items.

•"Net debt" is defined as total debt, less cash and cash equivalents.

•Management reviews OCI, OCI margins, earnings per share, or “EPS,” and free cash flow on an adjusted basis, which may exclude the impact of currency and other items such as acquisitions, asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and other special items. 

•Management reviews these measures because they exclude changes in currency exchange rates and other factors that may distort underlying business trends, thereby improving the comparability of PMI’s business performance between reporting periods. Furthermore, PMI uses several of these measures in its management compensation program to promote internal fairness and a disciplined assessment of performance against company targets. PMI discloses these measures to enable investors to view the business through the eyes of its management.

Reduced-Risk Products (RRPs)

•RRPs is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. PMI has a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Because our RRPs do not burn tobacco, they produce far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful compounds than found in cigarette smoke.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2016 Full-Year

In France, estimated industry size, PMI cigarette shipment volume and market share performance are shown in the table below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For the full year, the estimated total cigarette market decreased moderately by 1.2%, partly reflecting a lower prevalence of illicit trade and e-vapor products.

Excluding the impact of inventory movements, the estimated total market decreased by 4.6%, largely reflecting a comparison with a strong fourth quarter in 2015, in which the total market increased by 2.2%, driven by a lower prevalence of illicit trade and e-vapor products. The decrease in PMI's cigarette shipment volume mainly reflected the lower total cigarette market, partly offset by market share growth, driven by the same dynamics as those for the full year.

In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI.

PMI's business risks include: significant increases in cigarette-related taxes; the imposition of discriminatory excise tax structures; fluctuations in customer inventory levels due to increases in product taxes and prices; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions, often with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco use; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments; changes in adult smoker behavior; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials; and the integrity of its information systems.
