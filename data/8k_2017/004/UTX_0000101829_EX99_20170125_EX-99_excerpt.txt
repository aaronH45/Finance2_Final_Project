FARMINGTON, CT, Jan. 25, 2017 - United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. All results in this release reflect continuing operations unless otherwise noted.

"In 2016, UTC delivered solid financial results with adjusted earnings just above the top end of our expectations," said UTC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes. "UTC also realized significant operational achievements. Our aerospace businesses supported the entry into service of the A320neo and CSeries programs, our Climate, Controls & Security business introduced over 100 new products to enhance future growth, and Otis increased its global segment share for new equipment orders."

Hayes continued, "We remain confident in the 2017 expectations we laid out in December. Despite an uncertain global macro environment, our growing aerospace backlog and strategic investments in the commercial businesses position us well to generate higher organic growth in 2017, and we remain on track to our 2020 targets," Hayes added. "UTC remains focused on innovation for growth, execution, structural cost reduction, and disciplined capital allocation." 

Full year 2016 GAAP EPS of $6.13 was up 35 percent versus the prior year. 2016 results included $0.48 of net restructuring and other significant items, as compared with $1.77 in 2015. Adjusted EPS of $6.61 increased 5 percent year over year. 

Full year sales of $57.2 billion increased by 2 percent, as 2 points of organic sales growth and 1 point of net acquisitions growth were partially offset by 1 point of adverse foreign exchange. Net income for the year was $5.1 billion, up 27 percent versus the prior year. Cash flow from operations for the year was $6.4 billion (127 percent of net income attributable to common shareholders) and capital expenditures were $1.7 billion. Free cash flow of $4.7 billion in the year was 93 percent of net income attributable to common shareowners.

Fourth quarter sales of $14.7 billion were up 3 percent over the prior year. GAAP EPS was $1.26 (up from ($0.30) in the fourth quarter of 2015) and included 30 cents of net restructuring and other significant items. Adjusted EPS of $1.56 was up 2 percent versus the prior year. 

In the fourth quarter, Otis new equipment orders increased 3 percent versus the prior year at constant currency, including China where new equipment orders were flat. Equipment orders at UTC Climate, Controls & Security increased by 2 percent. Commercial aftermarket sales were down 6 percent at Pratt & Whitney, and were up 3 percent at UTC Aerospace Systems. 

UTC affirms its 2017 outlook and anticipates:

•Adjusted EPS of $6.30 to $6.60*;

•Total sales of $57.5 to $59 billion, with year over year growth of 1 to 3 percent including organic sales growth of 2 to 4 percent*;

•Free cash flow in the range of 90 to 100 percent* of net income attributable to common shareowners; 

•Share repurchases of $3.5 billion in 2017; and

•A $1 billion to $2 billion placeholder for acquisitions.

*Note: When we provide expectations for adjusted EPS, organic sales and free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures generally is not available without unreasonable effort. See "Use and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for additional information.

Use and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP information presented provides investors with additional useful information, but should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the related GAAP measures. Moreover, other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently, which limits the usefulness of these measures for comparisons with such other companies. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

Adjusted net sales, organic sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted net sales represents consolidated net sales from continuing operations (a GAAP measure), excluding significant items of a non-recurring and nonoperational nature (hereinafter referred to as "other significant items"). Organic sales represents consolidated net sales (a GAAP measure), excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures completed in the preceding twelve months and other significant items. Adjusted operating profit represents income from continuing operations (a GAAP measure), excluding restructuring costs and other significant items. Adjusted diluted EPS represents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (a GAAP measure), excluding restructuring costs and other significant items. For the business segments, when applicable, adjustments of net sales, operating profit and margins similarly reflect continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other significant items. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures just mentioned are useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of the Company’s ongoing operational performance. 

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents cash flow from operations (a GAAP measure) less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity and an additional basis for assessing UTC's ability to fund its activities, including the financing of acquisitions, debt service, repurchases of UTC's common stock and distribution of earnings to shareholders.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding amounts prepared in accordance with GAAP appears in the tables in this press release. The tables provide additional information as to the items and amounts that have been excluded from the adjusted measures. 

When we provide our expectations for adjusted EPS, organic sales and free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures (expected diluted EPS from continuing operations, sales, and expected cash flow from operations and sales) generally is not available without unreasonable effort due to potentially high variability, complexity and low visibility as to the items that would be excluded from the GAAP measure in the relevant future period, such as unusual gains and losses, the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact and timing of potential acquisitions and divestitures, and other structural changes or their probable significance. The variability of the excluded items may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP results.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise such statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.
