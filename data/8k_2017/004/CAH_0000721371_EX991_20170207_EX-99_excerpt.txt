Cardinal Health Reports Second-quarter Results for Fiscal Year 2017

•Revenue increased 5 percent to $33.1 billion [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Company updates fiscal year 2017 outlook

DUBLIN, Ohio, Feb. 7, 2017 - Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH) today reported second-quarter fiscal year 2017 revenue of $33.1 billion, an increase of 5 percent. The company also reported a decline in GAAP operating earnings of 4 percent to $542 million and in non-GAAP operating earnings of 4 percent to $701 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 4 percent to $1.02, while non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 3 percent to $1.34. 

“Our organization has shown great resilience in the first half of our fiscal 2017. While pricing in the generic pharmaceutical market was a significant headwind for our Pharmaceutical segment profit and our enterprise operating earnings, overall we are seeing greater growth in more lines of business than we’ve seen in some time,” said George Barrett, chairman and CEO of Cardinal Health. “Of particular note, we saw strong growth in our Specialty Solutions group, and our Medical segment, where virtually every part of that business grew.

“As we enter the second half of the year, our organization continues to work with a clear sense of purpose - patient-centered and squarely focused on helping our partners improve the quality, safety and efficiency of the healthcare system.” 

Q2 FY17 summary

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Diluted EPS for the quarter benefitted from a lower effective tax rate and fewer weighted average shares outstanding than the same quarter in the prior fiscal year.

Segment results

Pharmaceutical segment

Second-quarter revenue for the Pharmaceutical segment increased 5 percent to $29.7 billion due to growth from existing Pharmaceutical Distribution customers and strong performance from the Specialty business. 

Segment profit for the quarter decreased 14 percent to $537 million. This decrease was driven by generic pharmaceutical pricing and, to a lesser extent, the previously announced loss of a large Pharmaceutical Distribution customer. This was partially offset by solid performance from Red Oak Sourcing.

Medical segment

Second-quarter revenue for the Medical segment increased 8 percent to $3.4 billion, driven by contributions from net new and existing customers.

Segment profit increased 50 percent to $159 million due to the contribution from Cardinal Health Brand products, which includes Cordis. The increase reflects the $21 million unfavorable impact of the Cordis-related inventory fair value step-up in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Excluding this step-up, year-over-year Medical segment profit growth was 25 percent.

Fiscal year 2017 outlook

As previously disclosed, the company does not provide GAAP EPS outlook, because it is unable to reliably forecast most of the items that are excluded from GAAP EPS to calculate non-GAAP EPS. These items could cause EPS to differ materially from non-GAAP EPS. See "Use of Non-GAAP Measures" following the attached schedules for additional explanation.

Having completed more than half its fiscal year, the company is adjusting its fiscal year 2017 guidance range for non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations to $5.35 to $5.50 from $5.40 to $5.60. This now reflects non-GAAP EPS growth of 2 to 5 percent for the fiscal year.

More details about this outlook can be found on the company's webcast and accompanying slides; see below for details.

Additional second-quarter and recent highlights

•Renewed Department of Defense medical/surgical distribution prime vendor agreement

•Signed several new strategic distribution agreements that will enable Cordis, Cardinal Health's interventional vascular business, to rapidly expand its product portfolio in select countries globally

3GAAP diluted EPS for the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year period was favorably impacted by $0.09, which includes $0.05 due to change in the effective tax rate and $0.04 due to the change in weighted average shares outstanding. The change in GAAP diluted EPS due to the effective tax rate is calculated as ((GAAP Earnings before Income Taxes for the current period times (one minus the current period GAAP Effective Tax Rate)) minus (GAAP Earnings before Income Taxes for the current period times (one minus the prior period GAAP Effective Tax Rate))) 

divided by the current period weighted average shares outstanding. The change in GAAP diluted EPS due to the weighted average shares outstanding is calculated as (GAAP Net Earnings for the current period divided by the current period weighted average shares outstanding) minus (GAAP Net Earnings for the current period divided by the prior period weighted average shares outstanding).

4Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year period was favorably impacted by $0.11, which includes $0.06 due to change in the effective tax rate and $0.05 due to the change in weighted average shares outstanding. The change in Non-GAAP diluted EPS due to the effective tax rate is calculated as ((Non-GAAP Earnings before Income Taxes for the current period times (one minus the current period Non-GAAP Effective Tax Rate)) minus (Non-GAAP Earnings before Income Tax for the current period times (one minus the prior period Non-GAAP Effective Tax Rate))) divided by the current period weighted average shares outstanding. The change in Non-GAAP diluted EPS due to the weighted average shares outstanding is calculated as (Non-GAAP Net Earnings for the current period divided by the current period weighted average shares outstanding) minus (Non-GAAP Net Earnings for the current period divided by the prior period weighted average shares outstanding).

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

This earnings release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP"). 

In addition to analyzing our business based on financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate our performance, evaluate the balance sheet, engage in financial and operational planning, and determine incentive compensation because we believe that these measures provide additional perspective on and, in some circumstances are more closely correlated to, the performance of our underlying, ongoing business. We provide these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on our financial and operating results on a year-over-year basis and in comparing our performance to that of our competitors. However, the non-GAAP financial measures that we use may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by us should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth below should be carefully evaluated.

Exclusions from Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Management believes it is useful to exclude the following items from the non-GAAP measures presented in this earnings release for its own and for investors’ assessment of the business for the reasons identified below:

•LIFO charges and credits are excluded because the factors that drive last-in first-out ("LIFO") inventory charges or credits, such as pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and year-end inventory levels (which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal year-end), are largely out of our control and cannot be accurately predicted. The exclusion of LIFO charges from non-GAAP metrics allows for a better comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies’ financial results.

•Restructuring and employee severance costs are excluded because they relate to programs in which we fundamentally change our operations and because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business, which includes normal levels of reinvestment in the business.

•Amortization and other acquisition-related costs are excluded primarily for consistency with the presentation of the financial results of our peer group companies. Additionally, these non-cash amounts are variable in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, so their exclusion allows for better comparison of historical, current and forecasted financial results. We exclude other acquisition-related costs because they are directly related to an acquisition but do not meet the criteria to be recognized on the acquired entity’s initial balance sheet as part of the purchase price allocation. They are also significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions.

•Impairments and gains or loss on disposal of assets are excluded because they do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our ongoing business operations and their exclusion results in a metric that more meaningfully reflects the sustainability of our operating performance.

•Litigation recoveries or charges, net are excluded because they often relate to events that may have occurred in prior or multiple periods, do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our business and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount.

•Loss on extinguishment of debt is excluded because it does not typically occur in the normal course of business and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance. Additionally, the amount and frequency of this type of charge is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt financing transactions.

The tax effect for each of the items listed above is determined using the tax rate and other tax attributes applicable to the item and the jurisdiction(s) in which the item is recorded. The gross, tax and net impact of each item are presented with our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 

Forward Looking Non-GAAP Measures

In this earnings release, the Company presents its outlook for fiscal 2017 non-GAAP EPS. The Company does not provide EPS outlook, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to non-GAAP EPS, because changes in the items that the Company excludes from EPS to calculate non-GAAP EPS, described above, can be dependent on future events that are less capable of being controlled or reliably predicted by management and are not part of the Company’s routine operating activities. Additionally, due to their unpredictability, management does not forecast many of the excluded items for internal use and therefore cannot create or rely on an EPS outlook.

The timing and amount of any of the excluded items could significantly impact the Company’s fiscal 2017 EPS. Over the past five fiscal years, the excluded items have lowered the Company’s EPS from $0.14 to $2.76, which includes a goodwill impairment charge of $2.32 per share related to our Nuclear Pharmacy Services division that we recognized in fiscal 2013.
