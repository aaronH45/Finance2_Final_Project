Net operating income represents rental revenue and tenant reimbursement revenue from in-place leases, less rental property operating and maintenance expenses, property taxes and insurance expenses, and is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We caution you not to place undue reliance on our cash capitalization rates because they are based solely on data made available to us in the diligence process in connection with the relevant acquisitions and are calculated on a non-GAAP basis. Our calculation of the cash capitalization rate on acquisitions may change, based on our experience operating the properties subsequent to closing of the acquisitions. In addition, the actual cash capitalization rates may differ from our expectations based on numerous other factors, including the results of our final purchase price allocation, difficulties collecting anticipated rental revenues, tenant bankruptcies, property tax reassessments and unanticipated expenses at the properties that we cannot pass on to tenants.

•Digital Chicago Campus – 9333, 9355 and 9377 W. Grand Avenue, Franklin Park IL

Background

•In May 2012, Digital Realty acquired the three-building, 22-acre campus and created the Digital Chicago Campus.

•Based on strong demand for our Turn-Key Flex® data center product, as well as limited supply in the area, the first phase of construction began with the redevelopment of the 9333 W. Grand Ave. building in August 2012 to provide 117,515 square feet and accommodate 6.8 MW of IT Load.

•As market conditions continued to show limited supply of competitive space along with strong leasing activity, redevelopment of the 9355 W. Grand Ave. building commenced in June 2013 to provide 251,500 square feet and accommodate 14.4 MW of IT Load in eight 1,800 kW data centers. The IT density of the first floor in the 9355 Building was subsequently doubled from the original plan to satisfy customers' requirements thereby increasing the building's total IT Load from 14.4 MW to 21.6 MW.

•Redevelopment of the 9377 Building commenced in February 2016, with an estimated delivery date for the first suite in first quarter of 2017. The building is designed to provide 176,730 square feet and accommodate 12.8 MW of IT Load, with the potential to increase critical IT Load to 16.0 MW.

•In August 2016, Digital Realty acquired an 18.7 acre parcel of land at 9401 W. Grand Ave in Franklin Park, IL, adjacent to the current Digital Chicago Campus to support future growth. This site is planned to accommodate future datacenter development of up to 469,000 square feet and approximately 36.0 MW of IT Load, with potential to increase to 50 megawatts at high-density. This expansion enables Digital Realty to continue to compete for opportunities in the Chicago market. 

Opportunity

•Upon completion, the 9333, 9355 and 9377 W. Grand Ave. buildings will have 545,745 square feet to support upwards of 44.4 MW of IT Load.

•Development of the additional land would increase the Digital Chicago campus to 1,014,745 square feet with more than 80 MW of IT Load. 

•Campus utility service is provided by ComEd with 60 MW delivered by multiple 34.5 kV services. The proposed 9401 W. Grand Ave. development would include construction of a 100 MW electrical substation to support the expansion. 

•The 9333 W. Grand Ave. building includes four Turn-Key Flex® data centers and is 98% leased based upon total IT Load.

•Redevelopment of the second phase, 9355 W. Grand Ave., was completed during 2Q 2016 and the building is now 100% leased.

•The ground-up development of the 9377 W. Grand Ave. building is master planned for a 176,730 square foot building to accommodate up to 16 MW of IT Load Capacity. The building is currently under active development with the first 3.2 MW preleased in 3Q 2016.

•De President Business Park AMS15 site is currently under construction to deliver a 157,338 square foot building to support 12 MW of IT Capacity. 

•De President Business Park AMS16 is a greenfield site for future development and master planned for a 132,202 square foot building to provide at least 12MW of IT Capacity. 

Background

•Digital acquired the initial 5.4 acres for development of AMS15 in 2013. Based upon prospects of future demand we recently exercised an option to purchase the adjoining 5.1 acres for development of AMS16 to enable a campus master plan. 

•With exercise of the option for AMS16 for the additional 5.1 acres the entire campus has the potential to deliver at least 24 MW of IT Load. The AMS16 land is currently held for future data center development or for a customer build-to-suit. 

•Due to increased demand and resolution of oversupply concerns, we commenced construction of AMS15, our first speculative data center in Amsterdam. Initial design works for AMS15 were completed in 2015 and construction commenced in April 2016 to develop the 157,338 square foot building to accommodate for 12 MW of IT Load in six 2MW data centers. 

•AMS15's base building and the first 2MW data center are expected to deliver in 2Q 2017. The AMS15 M&E plant is designed to enable flexibility to also accommodate higher density customer requirements.

Funds from Operations (FFO): 

We calculate funds from operations, or FFO, in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from real estate transactions, excluding a gain from a pre-existing relationship, impairment charges, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), non-controlling interests in operating partnership and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs’ FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. 

Core Funds from Operations:

We present core funds from operations, or core FFO, as a supplemental operating measure because, in excluding certain items that do not reflect core revenue or expense streams, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in our core business operating performance. We calculate core FFO by adding to or subtracting from FFO (i) termination fees and other non-core revenues, (ii) transaction and integration expenses, (iii) loss from early extinguishment of debt, (iv) issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock, (v) change in fair value of contingent consideration, (vi) severance, equity acceleration, and legal expenses, (vii) bridge facility fees, (viii) loss on currency forwards and (ix) other non-core expense adjustments. Because certain of these adjustments have a real economic impact on our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of core FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate core FFO in a consistent manner. Accordingly, our core FFO may not be comparable to other REITs' core FFO. Core FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.

Constant-Currency Core Funds from Operations:

We calculate constant-currency core funds from operations by adjusting the core funds from operations for foreign currency translations. 

Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO): 

We present adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, as a supplemental operating measure because, when compared year over year, it assesses our ability to fund dividend and distribution requirements from our operating activities. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, AFFO will be used by investors as a basis to assess our ability to fund dividend payments in comparison to other REITs, including on a per share and unit basis. We calculate AFFO by adding to or subtracting from core FFO (i) non-real estate depreciation, (ii) amortization of deferred financing costs, (iii) amortization of debt discount/premium, (iv) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (v) straight-line rent revenue, (vi) straight-line rent expense, (vii) above- and below-market rent amortization, (viii) deferred non-cash tax expense, (ix) capitalized leasing compensation, (x) recurring capital expenditures and (xi) capitalized internal leasing commissions. Other REITs may not calculate AFFO in a consistent manner. Accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs’ AFFO. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: 

We believe that earnings before interest, loss from early extinguishment of debt, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), are useful supplemental performance measures because they allow investors to view our performance without the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization or the cost of debt and, with respect to Adjusted EBITDA, severance-related expense, equity acceleration, and legal expenses, transaction and integration expenses, (gain) on real estate transactions, (gain) on settlement of pre-existing relationship with Telx, loss on currency forwards, other non-core expense adjustments, noncontrolling interests, preferred stock dividends and issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA excluding severance-related expense, equity acceleration, and legal expenses, transaction and integration expenses, (gain) on real estate transactions, non-cash (gain) on lease termination, (gain) on settlement of pre-existing relationship with Telx, loss on currency forwards, other non-core expense adjustments, noncontrolling interests, preferred stock dividends and issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock. In addition, we believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are calculated before recurring cash charges including interest expense and income taxes, exclude capitalized costs, such as leasing commissions, and are not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of our business, their utility as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do; accordingly, our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to such other REITs’ EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our financial performance.

Net Operating Income (NOI) and Cash NOI:

Net operating income, or NOI, represents rental revenue, tenant reimbursement revenue and interconnection revenue less utilities expense, rental property operating expenses, repair and maintenance expenses, property taxes and insurance expenses (as reflected in the statement of operations). NOI is commonly used by stockholders, company management and industry analysts as a measurement of operating performance of the company’s rental portfolio. Cash NOI is NOI less straight-line rents and above and below market rent amortization. Cash NOI is commonly used by stockholders, company management and industry analysts as a measure of property operating performance on a cash basis. However, because NOI and cash NOI exclude depreciation and amortization and capture neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of NOI and cash NOI as measures of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate NOI and cash NOI in the same manner we do and, accordingly, our NOI and cash NOI may not be comparable to such other REITs’ NOI and cash NOI. Accordingly, NOI and cash NOI should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as measures of our performance.

Additional Definitions

Net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio is calculated using total debt at balance sheet carrying value, plus capital lease obligations, plus our share of JV debt, less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents divided by the product of Adjusted EBITDA (inclusive of our share of JV EBITDA) multiplied by four.

Debt-plus-preferred-to-total enterprise value is mortgage debt and other loans plus preferred stock divided by mortgage debt and other loans plus the liquidation value of preferred stock and the market value of outstanding Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. units, assuming the redemption of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. units for shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock.

Fixed charge coverage ratio is Adjusted EBITDA divided by the sum of GAAP interest expense, capitalized interest, scheduled debt principal payments and preferred dividends, excluding bridge facility fees. For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, GAAP interest expense was $56 million, capitalized interest was $5 million and scheduled debt principal payments and preferred dividends was $17 million.
