Table 1 — Consolidated Operating Results Highlights

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 

Non-GAAP metric — see definitions at the end of this earnings release.

Fourth quarter operating income increased 21 percent and operating margin rate increased 90 basis points to 13.0 percent, which includes higher segment operating income and a $92 million decline in unallocated corporate expense, principally due to lower deferred state tax expense than in the prior year period. Last year's fourth quarter deferred state tax expense was $76 million higher principally due to an accounting methods change adopted in that period. Fourth quarter 2016 segment operating income increased 8 percent to $772 million, due to higher sales volume, and segment operating margin rate decreased 50 basis points to 12.1 percent. For 2016, operating income increased 4 percent to $3.2 billion with an operating margin rate of 13.0 percent. The increase in 2016 operating income is due to lower unallocated corporate expense and higher sales volume, partially offset by lower net FAS/CAS pension adjustment.

Northrop Grumman Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Financial Results3

For the fourth quarter of 2016, federal and foreign income tax expense increased to $223 million from $162 million in the prior year period; the company's effective tax rate increased to 29.8 percent from 26.1 percent. For 2016, federal and foreign income tax expense declined to $723 million from $800 million in 2015, and the company's effective tax rate declined to 24.7 percent from 28.7 percent. The company's lower effective tax rate for 2016 is principally due to $85 million of excess tax benefits related to adoption of an accounting standards update for stock-based compensation, a $40 million benefit recognized in connection with the resolution of the IRS examination of the company's 2007-2011 tax returns, and a $33 million benefit associated with the repatriation of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. 

Total backlog as of Dec. 31, 2016, was $45.3 billion compared with $35.9 billion as of Dec. 31, 2015.

Table 2 — Cash Flow Highlights

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 

Non-GAAP metric — see definitions at the end of this earnings release.

Fourth quarter 2016 cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.5 billion compared to $1.6 billion provided in the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter 2016 free cash flow totaled $1.2 billion after capital expenditures of $312 million. 

For the full year, cash provided by operations improved to $2.8 billion from $2.2 billion in 2015, and free cash flow improved to $1.9 billion from $1.7 billion in 2015. Higher cash provided by operations and free cash flow are due to prior year voluntary pension contributions, changes in trade working capital and higher net earnings than in 2015, partially offset by an increase in net income tax payments. Last year's cash results included a $500 million pre-tax voluntary pension contribution, which reduced cash results by $325 million on an after-tax basis. 

Year-to-date changes in cash and cash equivalents include the following for cash from operating, investing and financing activities through Dec. 31, 2016:

Operating

•$2.8 billion provided by operations

Investing

•$920 million for capital expenditures 

Financing

•$1.5 billion for repurchase of common stock

•$749 million net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt

•$640 million for dividends

Refer to Table 1 for reconciliation to operating income.

Fourth quarter 2016 segment operating income increased 8 percent due to higher operating income at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. For 2016, segment operating income increased 1 percent due to higher operating income at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. Fourth quarter 2016 and full year 2016 segment operating margin rate declined to 12.1 percent and 12.0 percent, respectively, primarily due to changes in contract mix and timing of risk retirements in Aerospace Systems.

Aerospace Systems ($ millions)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Aerospace Systems fourth quarter 2016 sales increased 20 percent, and 2016 sales increased 9 percent. Higher sales in both periods are principally due to higher volume for Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems programs. Manned Aircraft sales rose due to higher restricted and E-2D volume, as well as increased F-35 deliveries, partially offset by lower volume on the B-2 program. For 2016, the company also had lower F/A-18 deliveries than in 2015. Autonomous Systems sales for both periods rose due to higher volume on the Triton and Global Hawk programs, partially offset by the ramp-down of the NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) program. Space sales were also higher for both periods due to higher restricted volume, which largely offset lower volume for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency and James Webb Space Telescope programs.

Aerospace Systems fourth quarter 2016 operating income increased 18 percent, and 2016 operating income increased 3 percent. Operating margin rate for both periods was 11.4 percent. Higher operating

income for both periods includes a $45 million gain on a property sale and higher operating income and margin rate for Autonomous Systems programs, partially offset by lower operating income and margin rate for Manned Aircraft due to changes in contract mix and the timing of risk retirements. 

Mission Systems ($ millions)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Mission Systems fourth quarter 2016 sales increased 9 percent due to higher volume across all reporting areas. Higher Sensors and Processing sales are primarily due to higher volume on airborne C4ISR programs, partially offset by lower volume for land and avionics C4ISR. Higher Advanced Capabilities sales include higher volume on navigation and maritime programs and missile defense and protective systems programs. Higher Cyber and ISR sales are due to increased volume for restricted and space programs. 

For 2016, sales increased 2 percent due to higher volume on Sensors and Processing and Advanced Capabilities programs, partially offset by lower volume on Cyber and ISR programs. Sensors and Processing sales increased primarily due to higher volume on communications programs, including ramp up on the JCREW program, increased restricted volume, and ramp up on the G/ATOR program, partially offset by lower volume on international programs. Higher Advanced Capabilities sales include increased volume for restricted programs and maritime systems and marine systems programs. Lower Cyber and ISR sales reflect lower volume on space programs.

Mission Systems fourth quarter 2016 operating income increased 7 percent, and operating margin rate decreased to 13.7 percent. Fourth quarter operating income reflects higher sales volume and a $21 million gain on the sale of a commercial cyber business, partially offset by a $49 million forward loss provision on an Advanced Capabilities program, principally due to cost growth for changes impacting fixed price options, which may not be fully recovered through additional contract value. For 2016, operating income increased 2 percent, consistent with higher sales volume, and operating margin rate was unchanged at 13.2 percent. 

Technology Services ($ millions)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Technology Services fourth quarter 2016 sales increased 8 percent due to higher sales for all reporting areas. For 2016, sales were comparable to the prior year and include higher volume for Systems and Modernization and Services programs, partially offset by lower volume for Advanced Defense Services and Global Logistics and Modernization programs. 

Technology Services fourth quarter 2016 operating income was unchanged from the prior year period, and operating margin rate declined 90 basis points to 10.3 percent. For 2016, operating income and operating margin rate were comparable to the prior year period.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Disclosure: This earnings release contains non-GAAP (accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) financial measures, as defined by SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) Regulation G and indicated by a footnote in the text of the release. While we believe investors and other users of our financial statements may find these non-GAAP financial measures useful in evaluating our financial performance and operational trends, they should be considered as supplemental in nature, and therefore, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Definitions are provided for the non-GAAP measures and reconciliations are provided in the body of the release. References to a “Table” in the definitions below relate to tables in the body of this earnings release. Other companies may define these measures differently or may utilize different non-GAAP measures.

Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We use free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, stock repurchases and the payment of dividends. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow is reconciled in Table 2.

Pension-adjusted metrics: For financial statement purposes, we account for our employee pension plans in accordance with GAAP (FAS). However, the cost of these plans is charged to our contracts in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the related U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) that govern such plans. We use pension-adjusted metrics as internal measures of financial performance and for performance-based compensation decisions. The following pension-adjusted measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our performance based upon the pension costs charged to our contracts. 

Net FAS/CAS pension adjustment: The difference between pension expense charged to contracts and included as cost in segment operating income in accordance with CAS and pension expense determined in accordance with FAS. Net FAS/CAS pension adjustment is presented in Table 1.

Pension-adjusted operating income: Operating income before the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment as defined above. Pension-adjusted operating income is reconciled in Table 1. 

Pension-adjusted operating margin rate: Pension-adjusted operating income as defined above, divided by sales. Pension-adjusted operating margin rate is reconciled in Table 1.

Pre-tax net pension adjustment per share: The per share impact, before tax, of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment as defined above. Pre-tax net pension adjustment per share is presented in Table 1.

After-tax net pension adjustment per share: The per share impact, after tax at the statutory rate of 35 percent, of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment as defined above. After-tax net pension adjustment per share is presented in Table 1.

Pension-adjusted diluted EPS: Diluted EPS excluding the after-tax net pension adjustment per share as defined above. Pension-adjusted diluted EPS is reconciled in Table 1.

Segment operating income: Total earnings from our three segments including allocated pension expense recognized under CAS, and excluding unallocated corporate items and FAS pension expense. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. Segment operating income is reconciled in Table 1.

Segment operating margin rate: Segment operating income as defined above, and reconciled in Table 1, divided by sales. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors.
