SECTION 8 - OTHER EVENTS.

Item 8.01. Other Events.

T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (the “Company”) recorded a one-time operating charge of $166.2 million in its second quarter of 2016 to compensate certain T. Rowe Price mutual funds, trusts, separately managed accounts and subadvised clients (collectively “T. Rowe Price Clients”) for the difference in valuation and statutory interest resulting from the denial of appraisal rights to the T. Rowe Price Clients by the Delaware Chancery Court in connection with the 2013 leveraged buyout of Dell, Inc. The Company made claims with its insurance carriers, and on December 30, 2016, entered into an agreement to recover $100 million for coverage of this claim. The Company recognized this insurance recovery in its fourth quarter of 2016 results as an offset to the related second quarter operating expense.

Remaining insurance claims filed with respect to this matter that could result in an additional recovery of up to $50 million are still pending. However, such recoveries, if any, will only be recognized in the period written agreements are reached with the applicable carriers.
