On February 10, 2017, Welltower Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a Retirement Agreement (the “Retirement Agreement”) with Jeffrey H. Miller regarding the terms of his retirement. Mr. Miller served as the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer until January 31, 2017 when his employment with the Company ended.

Following Mr. Miller’s retirement, the position of Chief Operating Officer was eliminated.  

Mr. Miller will receive the benefits set forth in Section 5(a) of his employment agreement, which was previously filed with the Commission on Form 10-K on March 2, 2009. In addition, his service-based stock awards will become fully vested as of the date of his retirement and he will receive a pro-rated payout of his awards under the Company’s 2015-2017 Long-Term Incentive Program and 2016-2018 Long-Term Incentive Program, in each case based on performance through December 31, 2016. A description of these benefits is contained in the Company’s most recent proxy statement filed with the Commission on March 24, 2016. The Retirement Agreement also includes a customary release by Mr. Miller of claims against the Company and its affiliates and a mutual non-disparagement covenant. Mr. Miller is also obligated to comply with various restrictive covenants, including a non-compete, non-solicitation and protection of the Company’s confidential information. Any disputes arising under the Retirement Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration.
