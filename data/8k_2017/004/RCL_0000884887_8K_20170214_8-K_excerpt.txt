Fain, our Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, entered into a pre-arranged stock trading plan designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Plan"). The Plan, which was adopted in compliance with our Securities Trading Policy, is intended to facilitate the diversification of Mr. Fainâ€™s personal assets and provides for the sale of up to 360,000 shares of our common stock between March 2017 and September 2018 subject to specified minimum market prices. 

In the event all of the shares subject to the Plan are sold and based on his current ownership, Mr. Fain would continue to beneficially own approximately 1,040,000 shares of our common stock, including approximately 350,000 shares underlying stock option, restricted stock unit and performance share awards granted to Mr. Fain under our equity compensation plans. This total does not include additional shares of our common stock owned by trusts primarily for the benefit of members of the Fain family.
