CEO COMMENTARY

Harris H. Simmons, Chairman and CEO, commented, “We are pleased that our full-year 2016 results reflect solid performance in revenue growth, tight expense control, and strong growth in both pre-provision net revenue and earnings per share. We are encouraged to report that we achieved all of the stated financial goals that we outlined in the spring of 2015 for this year, including holding adjusted noninterest expense to less than $1.58 billion and achieving an efficiency ratio less than 66%. We have done this while simultaneously making a very substantial investment in technology that we expect will allow Zions to be both more efficient and more competitive for years to come.” Mr. Simmons concluded, “We look forward to 2017 as a year that seems likely to experience reduced credit costs as the energy industry continues to heal and the credit metrics for non-energy loans, which constitute about 95% of our portfolio, are strong and generally stable.”

OPERATING PERFORMANCE2 

1 Net Earnings is net earnings applicable to common shareholders.

2 For information on non-GAAP financial measures and why the Company presents these numbers, see pages 18-21. Included in these non-GAAP financial measures are the key metrics to which Zions announced it would hold itself accountable in its June 1, 2015 efficiency initiative, and to which executive compensation is tied.

The percent change amounts presented in the following tables are calculated on amounts in thousands rather than millions.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net interest income increased to $480 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 from $469 million in the third quarter of 2016. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to a $10 million increase in interest from investment securities. The Company continues to change its mix of interest-earning assets as average money market investments declined in the fourth quarter of 2016 by $773 million, much of which was deployed into term investment securities. Average securities increased in the fourth quarter of 2016 by $1.9 billion and average loans and leases held for investment increased by $152 million. The Company’s accelerated purchase of securities during the fourth quarter relative to prior quarters was driven by the repositioning of the balance sheet as the Company continues to moderately reduce its interest rate sensitivity.

The net interest margin increased to 3.37% in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 3.36% in the third quarter of 2016. The increase in net interest margin was driven by increased yields and growth in the investment securities portfolio. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $128 million, compared to $145 million for the third quarter of 2016. The $17 million decline in total noninterest income during the quarter was primarily due to net

securities gains and customer-related fees. Customer-related fees decreased by $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the prior quarter, which was primarily due to a $5 million decline in loan sales and servicing income resulting from valuation adjustments on the Company’s rate lock agreements and an increase in the servicing asset valuation in the third quarter of 2016 that did not recur in the current quarter. Customer-related fees increased by $5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Another factor relating to the decline in noninterest income was a decrease in securities gains of $12 million from third quarter of 2016 primarily due to higher than normal gains in the prior quarter and a decrease of $6 million in the market value of one of the Company’s Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”) investments. Dividends and other investment income decreased by $5 million due to a third quarter increase in the market value of the Company’s SBIC investments followed by a decline in the current quarter.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 For information on non-GAAP financial measures see pages 18-21.

Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $405 million, compared to $403 million for the third quarter of 2016, and $397 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in total noninterest expense from the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to a $6 million increase in the provision for unfunded lending commitments and a $4 million increase in net furniture, equipment and software, primarily as a result of increased technology expenditures during the quarter and a $1.5 million reclassification of software maintenance expenses from other noninterest expense. The Company continues to invest in technology and make progress on its core systems upgrade. These increases were partially offset by an $8 million decline in other noninterest expense, which was higher in the prior quarter due to a legal accrual and true-ups related to the alignment of a single back-office operating environment. As previously disclosed, management’s incentive compensation is tied to its efficiency initiative and key profitability metrics. Elevated fourth quarter noninterest expenses directly resulted in management incentive compensation that was $5 million less than planned for the fourth quarter of 2016.

Despite the modest increase in total noninterest expense during the fourth quarter, the Company met its expense and efficiency ratio goals for 2016 by recognizing adjusted noninterest expense of less than $1.58 billion and achieving an efficiency ratio of 65.8%. For information on non-GAAP measures see pages 18-21. 

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Asset quality for the total portfolio remained strong and was generally stable when compared to the prior quarter. Nonperforming assets were $573 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $587 million at September 30, 2016. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and leases and other real estate owned decreased to 1.34% at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.37% at September 30, 2016. Classified loans for the total portfolio were $1,577 million at December 31, 2016 and $1,615 million at September 30, 2016. Total net charge-offs were $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, or an annualized 0.25% of average loans, compared to $30 million, or an annualized 0.28% of average loans, in the third quarter of 2016.

The Company provided $1 million for credit losses during the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $16 million during the third quarter of 2016. The allowance for credit losses decreased to $632 million at December 31, 2016 from $659 million at September 30, 2016, which was 1.48% and 1.55% of loans and leases, respectively. The decreases in the provision and the allowance for credit losses were primarily due to continued strong credit quality for the total portfolio in addition to a change in the portfolio mix, as oil and gas-related exposures declined, and residential real estate and commercial real estate term exposures increased. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments increased by $3 million as a result of adverse credit migration on certain oil and gas-related commitments.

Asset quality for the portfolio excluding oil and gas-related loans remained strong, with slight deterioration in nonperforming and classified metrics, which was driven by a few borrowers in various portfolios. The allowance for credit losses in the portfolio excluding oil and gas-related loans slightly decreased to 1.08% of loans and leases at December 31, 2016, compared to 1.13% at September 30, 2016, primarily due to changes in portfolio mix and continued nominal charge-offs outside of the oil and gas-related portfolio.

January 23, 2017

Excluding oil and gas-related loans, net charge-offs were $11 million, or an annualized 0.11% of average loans, in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $11 million of net recoveries, or an annualized (0.11)%, in the third quarter of 2016. Nonperforming assets for this portfolio were $239 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $211 million at September 30, 2016; the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and leases and other real estate owned for these same periods was 0.59% and 0.52%, respectively. At December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, for the portfolio excluding oil and gas-related loans, classified loans were $896 million and $849 million, and criticized loans were $1,269 million and $1,313 million, respectively.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Loans and leases, net of unearned income and fees, were $42.6 billion at December 31, 2016, compared to $42.5 billion at September 30, 2016. The oil and gas-related portfolio declined $156 million from the prior quarter due to payoffs, paydowns, charge-offs and active management of the portfolio. This decline was offset by $227 million of growth in consumer loans, predominately in 1-4 family residential loans. Excluding the reduction in oil and gas-related loans, net loans and leases increased $265 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. Unfunded lending commitments were $19.3 billion at December 31, 2016, compared to $19.1 billion at September 30, 2016.

1 Because many borrowers operate in multiple businesses, judgment has been applied in characterizing a borrower as oil and gas-related, including a particular segment of oil and gas-related activity, e.g., upstream or downstream; typically, 50% of revenues coming from the oil and gas sector is used as a guide. 

2 Total loan and lease balances and the credit quality measures do not include $40 million of oil and gas loans held for sale at December 31, 2016.

3 Calculated as the ratio of annualized net charge-offs for each respective period to loan balances at each period end.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, oil and gas-related loans decreased $156 million, or 7%, and total oil and gas credit exposure decreased by $218 million, or 5%. Oil and gas-related loans represent 5% of the total loan portfolio. Oil and gas services (oilfield services and oil and gas service manufacturing) decreased $120 million, or 16%, from the third quarter of 2016, and $361 million, or 36%, from the fourth quarter of 2015. Unfunded lending commitments decreased by $62 million during the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily in the oilfield services and oil and gas service manufacturing portfolios. Criticized oil and gas-related loans decreased $152 million, or 16%, during the fourth quarter of 2016, mainly due to payoffs and paydowns. Oil and gas-related loan net charge-offs were $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and were predominantly in the oilfield services portfolio, compared to $41 million in the third quarter of 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had entered into contracts to sell $40 million of oil and gas-related loans, and classified them as held for sale. The Company recognized $9 million of charge-offs in the fourth quarter on these held-for-sale loans. Approximately 86% of oil and gas-related nonaccruing loans were current as to principal and interest payments as of December 31, 2016, similar to the 87% reported as of September 30, 2016. The allowance for credit losses related to oil and gas-related loans decreased during the quarter and was 9% of such balances at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total deposits increased to $53.2 billion at December 31, 2016, compared to $50.8 billion at September 30, 2016, primarily due to seasonal increases. Average total deposits increased $1.5 billion to $52.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $50.7 billion for the third quarter of 2016. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased to $23.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $22.5 billion for the third quarter of 2016, and were 45% of average total deposits. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company continued its stock buyback program and repurchased $45 million of its stock during the quarter at an average price of $31.69 per share, and has repurchased $90 million of its stock since July 1, 2016 at an average price of $31.15 per share, leaving $90 million of buyback capacity remaining in the 2016 capital plan (which spans the timeframe of July 2016 to June 2017). Despite the share repurchases during the quarter, the weighted average diluted shares increased slightly due to dilution from the average market price per share of the common stock exceeding the exercise price per share of warrants to buy common stock that have been outstanding since 2008 (“TARP” warrants - NASDAQ: ZIONZ) and 2010 (NASDAQ: ZIONW). 

Preferred dividends are expected to be $10.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $12.4 million for the second quarter of 2017. Additionally, the Company reduced its long-term debt by $36 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 by exercising a call option for junior subordinated debentures related to trust preferred securities. 

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) decreased to $(122) million from $10 million, primarily as a result of a decline in the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale securities portfolio due largely to changes in the interest rate environment.

Tangible book value per common share decreased to $29.06 at December 31, 2016, compared to $29.16 at September 30, 2016, with the positive benefit of a $110 million increase of retained earnings during the quarter offset by the $132 million decline in accumulated other comprehensive income as described previously. The estimated Basel III common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio was 12.1% at December 31, 2016 compared to 12.0% at September 30, 2016; Basel III capital ratios are based on the applicable phase-in periods, however, the fully phased-in ratio was not substantially different.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations

(Unaudited)

This press release presents both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with additional information. The adjustments to reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the following tables. The Company considers these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results. The Company believes that excluding the amounts associated with these adjustments to present the non-GAAP financial measures provides a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to assess the performance and financial position of the Company and for presentations of Company performance to investors. The Company further believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors and analysts to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company, they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP. 

The following are the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Earnings Release and a discussion of why management uses these non-GAAP measures:

•Tangible Book Value per Common Share - this table also includes “Tangible common equity.” Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. 

•Tangible Return on Average Tangible Common Equity - this table also includes “Net earnings applicable to common shareholders, excluding the effects of the adjustments, net of tax” and “Average tangible common equity.” Tangible return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides useful information about the Company’s use of equity. Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. 

•Efficiency Ratio - this table also includes “Adjusted noninterest expense” and “Adjusted pre-provision net revenue (“PPNR”).” The methodology of determining the efficiency ratio may differ among companies. Management makes adjustments to exclude certain items as identified in the table below which management believes allows for more consistent comparability among periods. Management believes the efficiency ratio provides useful information regarding the cost of generating revenue. Adjusted noninterest expense provides a measure as to how well the Company is managing its expenses, and adjusted PPNR enables management and others to assess the Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. The efficiency ratio and adjusted noninterest expense are the key metrics to which the Company announced it would hold itself accountable in its June 1, 2015 efficiency initiative, and to which executive compensation is tied.

Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change. 

2 The restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2016 are primarily related to the termination of the Zions Direct auction platform and changes to create a simplified lending approach for our business banking customers.
