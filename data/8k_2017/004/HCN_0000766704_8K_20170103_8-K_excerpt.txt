On January 3, 2017, Welltower Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a new Employment Agreement with Thomas J. DeRosa, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, which will become effective on April 14, 2017, after the expiration of his current employment agreement.  

Pursuant to the new Employment Agreement, Mr. DeRosa will continue to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company until April 13, 2020. He will receive an annual base salary of $1,000,000, together with a target bonus opportunity under the Company’s annual cash bonus plan equal to 175% of his annual base salary and annual long-term stock awards under terms and conditions to be determined by the Compensation Committee. The Company will also lease an automobile for Mr. DeRosa’s use during the term of his employment.  

If Mr. DeRosa’s employment is terminated by the Company without good cause or he resigns for a good reason, (1) he will receive a pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination, two times his then current annual base salary and target annual cash bonus opportunity over a period of two years, and continued COBRA coverage for so long as such coverage is elected, (2) any vesting requirements of outstanding stock awards based on continued service will be considered to have been satisfied and (3) any vesting requirements of outstanding stock awards based upon performance will generally be measured as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding his termination and will be pro-rated to reflect the portion of the performance period during with Mr. DeRosa was employed, except to the extent future awards provide otherwise. If Mr. DeRosa’s employment is terminated without good cause or he resigns for a good reason upon or within 24 months following a change of control, he will receive a pro-rated target annual bonus for the year of termination, the present value of three times his then current annual base salary and the average of his last three annual cash bonuses, payable in a lump sum, and continued COBRA coverage for so long as such coverage is elected. Any severance payments or benefits payable to Mr. DeRosa will be subject to his execution of a customary release and compliance with customary restrictive covenants.
