Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In this earnings release, the company supplements its reporting of information determined in accordance with GAAP, such as revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, with "adjusted revenue," "internal revenue growth," "adjusted operating income," "adjusted operating margin," "adjusted net income," "adjusted earnings per share" and "free cash flow." Management believes that adjustments for certain non-cash or other items and the exclusion of certain pass-through revenue and expenses enhance shareholders' ability to evaluate the company's performance as such measures provide additional insights into the factors and trends affecting its business. Therefore, the company excludes these items from GAAP revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities to calculate these non-GAAP measures. The corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this earnings release, except for forward-looking measures where a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available due to the variability, complexity and low visibility of the non-cash and other items described below that are excluded from the non-GAAP outlook measures. See page 11 for additional information regarding the company's forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.

Examples of non-cash or other items may include, but are not limited to, non-cash deferred revenue adjustments arising from acquisitions, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, non-cash impairment charges, gains or losses from unconsolidated affiliates, severance costs, charges associated with early debt extinguishment, merger and integration costs related to acquisitions, and certain costs associated with the achievement of the company's operational effectiveness objectives. The company excludes these items to more clearly focus on the factors management believes are pertinent to its

operations, and management uses this information to make operating decisions, including the allocation of resources to the company's various businesses.

Internal revenue growth and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and are described on page 10. Management believes internal revenue growth is useful because it presents revenue growth excluding the effects of acquisitions and dispositions and the impact of postage reimbursements in the company's Output Solutions business, and including deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. Management believes free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions. Management believes this supplemental information enhances shareholders' ability to evaluate and understand the company's core business performance.

These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Internal Revenue Growth - The company's internal revenue growth outlook for 2017 excludes the effects of acquisitions and dispositions and the impact of postage reimbursements in its Output Solutions business, and includes deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. These adjustments are subject to variability and are anticipated to impact 2017 revenue growth by approximately 1 percent.

Adjusted Earnings Per Share - The company's adjusted earnings per share outlook for 2017 excludes certain non-cash or other items to enhance shareholders' ability to evaluate the company's performance as such measures provide additional insights into the factors and trends affecting its business. Non-cash or other items may be significant and include, but are not limited to, non-cash deferred revenue adjustments arising from acquisitions, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, non-cash impairment charges, gains or losses from unconsolidated affiliates, severance costs, charges associated with early debt extinguishment, merger and integration costs related to acquisitions, and certain costs associated with the achievement of the company's operational effectiveness objectives. The company estimates that the annual amortization expense with respect to acquired intangible assets recorded at December 31, 2016 will approximate $150 million in 2017. Other adjustments to earnings per share that have been incurred in 2016 are presented on page 6. Estimates of these other adjustments on a forward-looking basis are not available due to the variability, complexity and low visibility of these items.
