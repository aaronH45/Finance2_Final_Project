Fourth quarter 2016 net income was $164 million, compared to $149 million for the third quarter 2016 and $116 million for the fourth quarter 2015.

The Growth in Efficiency and Revenue ("GEAR Up") initiative continues to execute on the more than 20 work streams previously identified. 2016 progress includes a reduction in workforce, the consolidation of 19 banking centers and a significant reduction in retirement plan expense.

(a)Included restructuring charges of $20 million (7 cents per share, after tax) in both the fourth and third quarters of 2016.

(b)Included an increase of 1 million shares as a result of the impact of increased share price on common stock equivalents.

(d)See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

(e)Noninterest expenses as a percentage of the sum of net interest income (FTE) and noninterest income excluding net securities gains (losses). 

"2016 was a pivotal year with the development and implementation of our enterprise-wide GEAR Up initiative,” said Ralph W. Babb, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. “We have made significant progress in executing the expense savings and are fully committed to delivering on the efficiency and revenue opportunities to further enhance our profitability and shareholder value. We also benefited meaningfully from increased interest rates, and our overall credit metrics remained strong.

"Our fourth quarter earnings per share increased 10 percent over the third quarter," said Babb. "The benefits of GEAR Up were clearly demonstrated with a reduction in expenses and significant improvement in our efficiency ratio. In addition, the rise in rates late in the quarter boosted our net interest income. While average loan balances were relatively stable, reflecting seasonality in some of our businesses along with the continued reduction of our Energy portfolio, average deposit growth was robust, increasing $1.6 billion over the third quarter. Credit quality continued to be strong with net charge-offs at the low end of our historical norm. Finally, we increased our share buyback to $99 million, in line with our 2016 Capital Plan.

"As we look forward to the year ahead, we remain keenly focused on continued implementation of our GEAR Up initiatives while growing loans and deposits as we make necessary investments over time. Our revenue picture looks brighter as a result of the Federal Reserve increasing its benchmark rate 25 basis points in December. With oil prices stabilizing, we remain very comfortable with our Energy portfolio and the level of reserves we have established. We also believe we are well positioned to benefit from any further improvement in rates, and from favorable changes in the regulatory environment and the economy."

Credit Quality

“Our overall credit picture remains strong,” said Babb. “The provision and net charge-offs increased modestly from the very low levels of the third quarter.

Total criticized loans declined $405 million and nonaccrual loans were down $49 million. 

“Over the past year, we have reduced our Energy loans by over $800 million, or 27 percent, which now represent less than 5 percent of our total loans. As the performance of this portfolio has improved, including a $319 million decrease in criticized loans in the fourth quarter, we have modestly reduced our reserve allocation, which sits at over 7 percent for energy loans as of December 31st.”

Full-Year 2017 Outlook

For full-year 2017 compared to full-year 2016, management expects the following, assuming a continuation of the current economic and low rate environment as well as contributions from the GEAR Up initiative of $30 million in revenue and $125 million in expense savings, are as follows:

•Average loans higher, in line with Gross Domestic Product growth, reflecting increases in most lines of business and reduced headwinds from a declining Energy portfolio.

•Net interest income higher, reflecting the benefit from the December 2016 short-term rate increase and loan growth, partially offset by higher funding costs and minor loan yield compression.

◦Full-year benefit from the December rise in short-term rates expected to be more than $70 million, assuming a 25 percent deposit beta.

•Provision for credit losses lower, with continued solid performance of the overall portfolio. 

◦Provision and net charge-offs in line with historical normal levels of 30-40 basis points.

•Noninterest income higher, with the execution of GEAR Up opportunities, modest growth in treasury management and card fees, as well as wealth management products such as fiduciary and brokerage services. 

◦Increase of 4 percent to 6 percent.

•Noninterest expenses lower, reflecting lower restructuring charges and an additional $125 million in GEAR Up savings, relative to 2016 GEAR Up savings of more than $25 million. Outside processing is expected to increase in line with growing revenue. Headwinds include increased technology costs and higher FDIC insurance expense, as well as typical inflationary pressure. The gains of $13 million in 2016 from early terminations of certain leveraged lease transactions are not expected to repeat.

◦Restructuring charges of $25 million to $50 million, compared to $93 million in 2016.

◦Remaining noninterest expenses 1 percent to 2 percent lower.

◦Decrease of 4 percent to 5 percent including restructuring charges.

•Income tax expense to approximate 33 percent of pre-tax income.

The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders equity per share of common stock. Comerica believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.
