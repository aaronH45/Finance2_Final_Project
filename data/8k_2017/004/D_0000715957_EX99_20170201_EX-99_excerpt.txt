RICHMOND, Va. – Dominion Resources (NYSE: D) today announced unaudited reported earnings determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (reported earnings) for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2016, of $457 million ($0.73 per share) compared with earnings of $357 million ($0.60 per share) for the same period in 2015. Reported earnings for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2016 were $2.1 billion ($3.44 per share) compared with earnings of $1.9 billion ($3.20 per share) for the same period in 2015. 

Operating earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2016, were $618 million ($0.99 per share), compared to operating earnings of $416 million ($0.70 per share) for the same period in 2015. Operating earnings for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2016 were $2.3 billion ($3.80 per share), compared to operating earnings of $2.0 billion ($3.44 per share) for the same period in 2015. Operating earnings are defined as reported earnings adjusted for certain items. 

The principal difference between reported earnings and operating earnings for the quarter is related to charges associated with future ash pond and landfill closures. The principal difference between reported earnings and operating earnings for the full year is related to charges associated with future ash pond and landfill closures, costs associated with the Dominion-Questar combination and the company's organizational design initiative. 

Dominion uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings guidance and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the Board of Directors, for the company's incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's fundamental earnings power. 

Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said: 

"We are very pleased with our strong safety, operational and financial performance in 2016. Operating earnings per share were in the middle of our guidance range and 10 percent above last year's. In December, our Board established a 2017 dividend rate that would result in an increase of 8 percent from 2016. This is the third straight year of 8 percent annual dividend growth, which is among the best in the industry. We anticipate being able to increase the dividend at greater than 8 percent beginning in 2018. 

"Our employees set another new company-wide safety record. Several projects began operating, including Brunswick County Power Station, which was honored with a number of industry awards – Best Overall Generation Project of the Year among them. 

"We continue executing on our growth projects, and have begun constructing the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County combined-cycle power station. The project is on time and on budget. 

"Our Cove Point Liquefaction project made significant progress this year. It is now 84 percent complete and is on time, with an expected in-service date in late 2017. 

"We received a draft Environmental Impact Statement from FERC for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header project. Our company continues working toward a construction start date later this year. We expect to complete these projects in late 2019." 

FULL-YEAR 2016 REPORTED AND OPERATING EARNINGS COMPARED TO 2015 

Reported earnings in 2016 were 24 cents per share higher than full-year reported earnings in 2015. Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2016 and 2015 reported earnings but excluded from operating earnings may be found on Schedules 1, 2, and 3 of this release. 

Operating earnings in 2016 rose 36 cents per share from full-year 2015 operating earnings of $3.44 per share. The increase in operating earnings was primarily attributable to growth projects in our regulated electric and gas service areas, lower capacity expenses and investment tax credits from solar facilities. Offsetting drivers for the year included lower farmout earnings, higher depreciation, interest costs and share dilution. 

Details of fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 operating earnings as compared to 2015 may be found on Schedule 4 of this release. 

OPERATING EARNINGS GUIDANCE 

Dominion expects full-year 2017 operating earnings in the range of $3.40-$3.90 per share, compared to full-year 2016 operating earnings of $3.80 per share. Positive drivers include increased revenues from our growth projects and the addition of Dominion Questar. The company expects negative drivers for the year to include a reduction of Cove Point import contract revenues, a second Millstone refueling outage, lower hedged power prices at Millstone, a step down in solar investment tax credits and share dilution. 

First-quarter 2017 operating earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.90-$1.10 per share. 

Expected revenues from Cove Point export contracts, along with other growth drivers, support at least 10 percent year over year growth in full-year 2018 operating earnings. Furthermore, Dominion expects a 6 to 8 percent compound average growth rate in earnings through 2020 from a 2017 base reflecting contributions from its diverse portfolio of businesses. 

In providing its operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, acquisitions, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. At this time, Dominion management is not able to estimate the aggregate impact of these items on future period reported earnings.
