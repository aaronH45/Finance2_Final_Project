On January 10, 2017, Albemarle Corporation (the “Company”) announced the pricing and expiration of its tender offers to purchase for cash any and all of the 3.000% notes due 2019 (“2019 Notes”) and the 4.500% notes due 2020 (“2020 Notes” and, together with the 2019 Notes, the “Notes”), issued by the Company. The tender offers were made exclusively pursuant to an offer to purchase dated January 4, 2017, related letter of transmittal and notice of guaranteed delivery, which set forth the terms and conditions of the tender offers (collectively, the “Tender Offer Documents”). The tender offers expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 10, 2017 (such time and date, the “Expiration Date”).

These amounts include outstanding Notes tendered pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedures described in the Tender Offer Documents, which remain subject to the holders’ performance of the delivery requirements under such procedures.

The Company currently intends to deliver a notice of redemption to redeem all of the 2019 Notes that were not validly tendered and accepted in the tender offers in accordance with the terms of the make-whole redemption provisions under the indenture governing the 2019 Notes.
