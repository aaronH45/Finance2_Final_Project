People’s United Financial Reports Fourth Quarter Net Income of $75.9 Million, or $0.24 Per Common Share  

BRIDGEPORT, CT – People’s United Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBCT) today reported net income of $75.9 million, or $0.24 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $70.8 million, or $0.23 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2015, and $73.7 million, or $0.24 per common share, for the third quarter of 2016.  

Included in this quarter’s results were merger-related and acquisition integration costs of $1.6 million ($1.0 million after-tax), or less than $0.01 per common share, compared to $3.1 million ($2.1 million after-tax), or $0.01 per common share, for the third quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2015 results included a gain of $9.2 million ($6.1 million after-tax), or $0.02 per common share, resulting from the sale of the Company’s payroll services business.  

For the year ended December 31, 2016, net income totaled $281.0 million, or $0.92 per common share, compared to $260.1 million, or $0.86 per common share, for 2015.  

The Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.17 per share quarterly dividend, payable February 15, 2017 to shareholders of record on February 1, 2017. Based on the closing stock price on January 18, 2017, the dividend yield on People’s United Financial common stock is 3.5 percent.  

“We are pleased with the Company’s financial and operating performance this year,” commented Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Full year net income of $281 million is the highest in the Company’s history and return on average tangible common equity was 10.2 percent. Our straightforward, solutions-oriented approach to banking enabled us to further expand client relationships and forge new ones as demonstrated by another year of growth in loans, deposits and wealth management assets. We continued to improve operating leverage during the year through revenue growth as well as proactive expense management which has limited the increase in expenses to an average annual rate of less than one percent over the last five years.”  

Barnes continued, “We strengthened fee income generating capabilities over the course of the year through infrastructure investments and acquisitions, most notably the addition of Gerstein Fisher which closed in early November. We also continued to strategically add talent across the organization to further drive revenue growth. Earlier in the year, we announced the acquisition of Suffolk Bancorp which upon closing will deepen our presence in the New York metro area.”

Barnes concluded, “We continually strive to balance and utilize six levers to create shareholder value: enhancing client-focused capabilities, growing the balance sheet, maintaining excellent asset quality, diversifying revenues, controlling costs and deploying capital efficiently. As such, we enter 2017 well-positioned across our diverse portfolio of businesses and attractive Northeast footprint to further deliver exceptional service to clients and profitable growth to shareholders.”  

“Our fourth quarter performance provided a strong finish to the year as evidenced by record quarterly net income of $75.9 million and a return on average tangible common equity of 10.7 percent,” stated David Rosato, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “Net income increased seven percent from the prior year quarter due to higher net interest income and continued expense control. As a result, the efficiency ratio was 59.3 percent, an improvement of 170 basis points from a year ago.”  

Rosato concluded, “Loans grew five percent on an annualized basis, marking the 25th consecutive quarter of growth. The increase was driven by strong results in commercial real estate and residential mortgage, partially offset by lower mortgage warehouse lending balances. We maintained excellent asset quality across each portfolio, reflected by net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans of only six basis points for the quarter. Deposit growth was three percent annualized, while the overall cost of deposits remained consistent with the third quarter. Furthermore, we issued $250 million of preferred stock which enhanced our already strong capital position.”  

At December 31, 2016, People’s United Financial’s common equity tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital ratios were 9.9 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively, and the tangible common equity ratio stood at 7.2 percent. For People’s United Bank, N.A., common equity tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital ratios were 11.3 percent and 13.4 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2016.  

Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average total loans on an annualized basis were 0.06 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, a slight increase from 0.04 percent in the third quarter of 2016, but lower than 0.09 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the originated loan portfolio, non-performing loans equaled 0.51 percent of loans at December 31, 2016, a decrease from 0.54 percent at September 30, 2016 and 0.58 percent at December 31, 2015.  

Return on average assets of 0.75 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016 was an increase from 0.73 percent in the third quarter of 2016 and unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2015. Return on average tangible common equity of 10.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 was unchanged from both the third quarter of 2016 and fourth quarter of 2015.

Loans acquired in connection with business combinations are initially recorded at fair value, determined based upon an estimate of expected cash flows, including a reduction for estimated credit losses, and without carryover of the respective portfolio’s historical allowance for loan losses. A decrease in expected cash flows in subsequent periods may indicate that a loan is impaired, which would require the establishment of an allowance for loan losses. As such, selected asset quality metrics have been highlighted to distinguish between the ‘originated’ portfolio and the ‘acquired’ portfolio.  

NON-PERFORMING ASSETS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Reported net of government guarantees totaling $13.1 million at December 31, 2016, $13.0 million at September 30, 2016, $15.8 million at June 30, 2016, $16.2 million at March 31, 2016 and $16.9 million at December 31, 2015.  

 (2) Represents acquired loans that meet People’s United Financial’s definition of a non-performing loan but are not, under the accounting model for acquired loans, subject to classification as non-accrual in the same manner as originated loans. Because acquired loans are initially recorded at an amount estimated to be collectible, losses on such loans, when incurred, are first applied against the non-accretable difference established in purchase accounting and then to any allowance for loan losses recognized subsequent to acquisition.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP  

In addition to evaluating People’s United Financial Inc. (“People’s United”) results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible common equity ratios, tangible book value per share and operating earnings metrics. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People’s United’s underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. Further, the efficiency ratio and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control, while the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of People’s United’s capital position.  

The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People’s United to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding operating lease expense, goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangible assets, losses on real estate assets and non-recurring expenses, which are also excluded in arriving at operating non-interest expense) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis plus total non-interest income (including the FTE adjustment on bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) income, the netting of operating lease expense and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans and acquired loans, and non-recurring income) (the denominator). People’s United generally considers an item of income or expense to be non-recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.  

Operating earnings exclude from net income available to common shareholders those items that management considers to be of such a non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), People’s United’s results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to: (i) non-recurring gains/losses; (ii) merger-related expenses, including acquisition integration and other costs; (iii) writedowns of banking house assets and related lease termination costs; (iv) severance-related costs; and (v) charges related to executive-level management separation costs, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Effective with the quarter ended March 31, 2016, recurring writedowns of banking house assets and certain severance-related costs are no longer considered to be non-operating expenses. Operating earnings per common share is derived by determining the per share impact of the respective adjustments to arrive at operating earnings and adding (subtracting) such amounts to (from) earnings per common share, as reported. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average total assets. Operating return on average tangible common equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average tangible common equity. The operating dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.  

The tangible common equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible common equity (total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock, goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the denominator). Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible common equity by common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) common shares).  

In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by People’s United for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions.
