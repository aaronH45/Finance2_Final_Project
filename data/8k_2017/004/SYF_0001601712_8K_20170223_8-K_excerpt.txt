Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure.

On February 23, 2017, Synchrony Financial (the “Company”) filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, (“2016 Form 10-K”) which included the presentation of certain selected metrics and average balances for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 within Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation based upon the use of daily averages. The Company had previously used monthly averages for these periods as the collection of daily averages involved undue burden and expense. The change in method of calculation for these periods resulted in immaterial changes to average loan receivables of less than 1%, to net interest margin of less than 10 basis points, and to net charge-offs as a percentage of average loan receivables, including held for sale, of less than 5 basis points.

Additional quarterly information for these selected metrics and average balances for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, based upon the use of daily averages consistent with the information included in the 2016 Form 10-K, is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.

The information contained in this Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, is furnished pursuant to Item 7.01 of Form 8-K and shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.
