Atlanta, January 11, 2017 --- Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management (AUM) of $812.9 billion, an increase of 0.9% month over month. The increase was driven by favorable market returns, an increase in money market AUM, and inflows in PowerShares QQQâ€™s; partially offset by negative foreign exchange and modest net long-term outflows. FX decreased AUM by $1.5 billion. Preliminary average total AUM for the quarter through December 31 were $809.0 billion, and preliminary average active AUM for the quarter through December 31 were $667.0 billion.
