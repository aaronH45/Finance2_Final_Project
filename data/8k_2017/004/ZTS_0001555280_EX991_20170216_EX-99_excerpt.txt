PARSIPPANY, N.J. - Feb. 16, 2017 - Zoetis Inc. (NYSE: ZTS) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 and updated its guidance for the full year 2017. 

The company reported revenue of $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, which was flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $154 million, or $0.31 per diluted share compared with $22 million and $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 excludes the net impact of $78 million for purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. 

On an operational2 basis, revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. This performance reflects the impact of fewer calendar days in the quarter, product rationalizations and business changes in certain markets as part of the company’s operational efficiency initiative, and acquisitions. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 13% operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.

On an operational basis, revenue for full year 2016 increased 5%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This performance reflects the impact of product rationalizations and business changes in certain markets as part of the company’s operational efficiency initiative as well as acquisitions.

EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY 

“In 2016 we delivered our fourth consecutive year of operational revenue growth and improved profitability since becoming a public company,” said Juan Ramón Alaix, Chief Executive Officer of Zoetis. “Our 5% operational growth for the year was driven by the successful launch of several new products and the strength of our diverse portfolio. We also completed significant initiatives to shape our business for greater efficiency and cash generation, which helped us deliver 17% operational growth in adjusted net income and make investments that will sustain our future growth, innovation and market leadership.”

“In the fourth quarter, we delivered another solid quarter of double-digit operational growth in adjusted net income, overcoming the negative impact to revenue of fewer calendar days and business changes related to our operational efficiency initiative,” said Glenn David, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Zoetis.

“In 2017, we again expect revenue to grow in line with or faster than the market and to deliver double-digit growth in adjusted net income -- fully realizing the benefits of our operational efficiency initiative. Cash flow is expected to grow significantly in 2017, and we will leverage our improved financial position for investments in promising internal and external opportunities and to return excess capital to shareholders.”

QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTS 

Zoetis organizes and manages its commercial operations across two regional segments: the United States (U.S.) and International. Within these segments, the company delivers a diverse portfolio of products for livestock and companion animals tailored to local trends and customer needs. In the fourth quarter of 2016:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Revenue in the International segment was $636 million, an increase of 2% on both a reported and operational basis compared with the fourth quarter of 2015; this growth reflects the impact of product rationalizations, fewer calendar days, and acquisitions. Sales of companion animal products grew 8% on a reported basis and 10% operationally, primarily due to increased sales of Apoquel and other new product launches. Sales of livestock products were flat on a reported basis and declined 1% operationally. The impact of product rationalizations and fewer calendar days were offset by growth from the acquisition of PHARMAQ, as well as growth in cattle and swine products in key emerging markets. 

Zoetis continues to drive demand and strengthen its diverse portfolio through new product delivery, lifecycle innovations, strong customer relationships and access to new markets and technologies. The company is focused on enhancing the performance and delivery of its current product lines; expanding product indications across species; pursuing approvals in new geographies; and developing and marketing innovative medicines, treatments and solutions for emerging diseases and unmet customer needs. 

Zoetis continues to advance animal health through innovations that address market needs or improve veterinarians’ approach to treatment.

•The company continued to strengthen its canine dermatology portfolio with the approval of Cytopoint and further geographic expansion of Apoquel. Zoetis received a full license from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for Cytopoint, the first monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy approved to help provide a reduction in the clinical signs associated with atopic dermatitis in dogs. The company also received approval in Argentina and Korea for Apoquel, a novel Janus Kinase inhibitor for the control of pruritus, or itching, associated with allergic dermatitis and the control of atopic dermatitis in dogs; Apoquel was first approved in the U.S. in 2013. 

•Simparica, a once-monthly flea and tick medication for dogs, was approved in Australia. Meanwhile, in the U.S. and Canada, the product received a new claim approval for protection from an additional tick species known as Ixodes scapularis (black-legged tick) which is associated with the transmission of Lyme disease.

The company continues to receive approvals for new indications and formulations of key livestock products, as well as expand major products into new geographies.

also expanded its Fostera® swine vaccine franchise. In the U.S., Fostera PCV MH received approval for 23 weeks duration of immunity against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyo), making it the only combination vaccine to have demonstrated 23 weeks duration of immunity for both porcine circovirus-type 2 and M. hyo.

FINANCIAL GUIDANCE 

Zoetis' guidance for the full year 2017 has been updated to reflect foreign exchange rates as of late January.

•Adjusted diluted EPS for the full year between $2.26 to $2.36 per share

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Zoetis expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A further list and description of risks, uncertainties and other matters can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, including in the sections thereof captioned “Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Future Results” and “Item 1A.

These filings and subsequent filings are available online at www.sec.gov, www.zoetis.com, or on request from Zoetis. 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and operational results (which exclude the impact of foreign exchange), to assess and analyze our results and trends and to make financial and operational decisions. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors because they provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release should not be considered alternatives to measurements required by GAAP, such as net income, operating income, and earnings per share, and should not be considered measures of liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this press release and are posted on our website at www.zoetis.com.

(b)Non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies.

2017 GUIDANCE 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January 2017.

Reconciliations of 2017 reported guidance to 2017 adjusted guidance follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Operational growth (a non-GAAP financial measure) excludes the impact of foreign exchange.

(b)Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are defined as reported U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income and its components and reported diluted EPS excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. Adjusted cost of sales, adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses, and adjusted interest expense and other (income)/deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and, therefore, components of the overall adjusted income measure. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is defined as reported EBIT excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. 

(c)We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted net income operational growth to the most directly comparable GAAP reported financial measure because we are unable to calculate with reasonable certainty the foreign exchange impact of unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, potential future asset impairments and other certain significant items, without unreasonable effort. The foreign exchange impacts of these items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. 

(d)Primarily includes certain nonrecurring costs related to restructuring, net gains/losses on sales of assets, and other charges for the operational efficiency initiative and supply network strategy.
