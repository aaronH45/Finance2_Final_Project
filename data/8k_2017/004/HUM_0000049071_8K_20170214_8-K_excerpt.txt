Also as previously disclosed, effective as of December 21, 2016, the Company and Parent entered into a letter agreement extending the End Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Merger Agreement by each agreeing to waive until 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on February 15, 2017, its right to terminate the Merger Agreement due to a failure of the merger to have been completed on or before December 31, 2016. 

The Parties entered into a mutual Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), as of February 14, 2017, under which the Parties agreed that the Merger Agreement, including all schedules and exhibits thereto, and all ancillary agreements contemplated thereby or entered into pursuant thereto (collectively the “Transaction Documents”), were terminated, effective immediately. Under the Termination Agreement, Parent agreed to pay the Company the Regulatory Termination Fee (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of $1.0 billion in cash within five business days of the date of the Termination Agreement. The parties also agreed to release each other from any and all liability, claims, rights, actions, causes of action, suits, liens, obligations, accounts, debts, demands, agreements, promises, liabilities, controversies, costs, charges, damages, expenses and fees, however arising, in connection with, arising out of or related to the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated therein or thereby. 

The Company has also terminated that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 2, 2016, between the Company and Molina Healthcare, Inc. (“Molina”), and will therefore pay the applicable termination fee plus the Company’s pro rata share of Molina’s transaction costs.
