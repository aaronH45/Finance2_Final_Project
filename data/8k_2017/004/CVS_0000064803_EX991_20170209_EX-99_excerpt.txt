WOONSOCKET, RHODE ISLAND, February 9, 2017 - CVS Health Corporation (NYSE: CVS) today announced operating results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016.

President and CEO Larry Merlo stated, “In 2016, we delivered strong results across the enterprise, with revenues up nearly 16% and Adjusted EPS up more than 13%. Adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter came in just above the high end of our guidance, as the Retail/LTC segment delivered results in line with our expectations while the PBM exceeded expectations. We also generated more than $8 billion in free cash for the full year, exceeding our expectation, and we returned more than $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our substantial cash generation capabilities provide opportunities to bolster our growth, and we will continue to be thoughtful and disciplined with respect to using our free cash to return value to shareholders.”

Revenues

Net revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2016 increased 11.7%, or $4.8 billion, to $46.0 billion, up from $41.1 billion in the three months ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net revenues increased 15.8%, or $24.2 billion, to $177.5 billion, compared to $153.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Revenues in the Pharmacy Services Segment increased 17.9% to $31.3 billion in the three months ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by growth in pharmacy network and specialty pharmacy claims. Pharmacy network claims processed during the three months ended December 31, 2016, increased 23.9% to 294.3 million, compared to 237.4 million in the prior year. The increase in pharmacy network claim volume was primarily due to an increase in net new business. Mail choice claims processed during the three months ended December 31, 2016, increased 4.7% to 23.2 million, compared to 22.2 million in the prior year. The increase in the mail choice claim volume was primarily driven by continued adoption of our Maintenance Choice® offerings and an increase in specialty pharmacy claims, partially offset by a decline in traditional mail

volume. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net revenues in the Pharmacy Services Segment increased 19.5% to $120.0 billion, compared to $100.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2015.

Revenues in the Retail/LTC Segment increased 4.7% to $20.8 billion in the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was largely driven by the addition of the pharmacies of Target Corporation (“Target”), which were acquired in December 2015. Pharmacy same store prescription volumes rose 2.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis. Same store sales decreased 0.7% versus the prior year, with pharmacy same store sales up 0.2% and front store same store sales down 2.9%. Front store same store sales were negatively impacted by softer customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies, partially offset by an increase in basket size. Pharmacy same store sales were negatively impacted for the quarter by approximately 380 basis points due to recent generic introductions. 

For the year ended December 31, 2016, net revenues in the Retail/LTC Segment increased 12.6% to $81.1 billion, compared to $72.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2015. Pharmacy same store prescription volumes rose 3.6% on a 30-day equivalent basis. Same store sales increased 1.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016, over the prior year, with pharmacy same store sales up 3.2% and front store same store sales down 1.5%. 

For the three months ended December 31, 2016, the generic dispensing rate increased approximately 170 basis points to 85.4% in our Pharmacy Services Segment and increased approximately 120 basis points to 85.2% in our Retail/LTC Segment, compared to the prior year.

Operating Profit

For the three months ended December 31, 2016, consolidated operating profit increased $266 million. Operating profit for the quarter increased $242 million in the Pharmacy Services Segment and decreased $53 million in the Retail/LTC Segment. The Pharmacy Services Segment operating profit includes the favorable impact of a reversal of an accrual of $88 million in connection with a legal settlement. The Retail/LTC Segment operating profit includes acquisition-related integration costs of $87 million in 2016 versus $52 million in 2015 and an asset impairment charge of $34 million in 2016 recorded in connection with our 2017 store rationalization. Both segments benefited from increased generic drugs dispensed. The Pharmacy Services Segment was also positively affected by growth in specialty pharmacy, growth in Medicare Part D lives and favorable purchasing economics. The Retail/LTC Segment was also positively affected by the acquisition of the pharmacies and clinics of Target as well as an improved front store margin rate. These positive factors for both segments were partially offset by continued price compression in the Pharmacy Services Segment and reimbursement pressure in the Retail/LTC Segment. Corporate Segment operating expenses decreased $92 million from the prior year primarily due to the $90 million legal charge in the prior year associated with a disputed 1999 legal settlement.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, consolidated operating profit increased $884 million. Operating profit for the year increased by $683 million in the Pharmacy Services Segment and $151 million in the Retail/LTC Segment. The Pharmacy Services Segment operating profit includes the favorable legal matter discussed previously. The Retail/LTC Segment includes acquisition-related integration costs of $281 million in 2016 versus $64 million in 2015 and an asset impairment charge in 2016 of $34 million. The drivers of the increases are the same as those described above for the three months ended December 31, 2016, as well as the acquisition of Omnicare, Inc. (“Omnicare”) in August 2015. Corporate Segment operating expenses decreased $143 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs of $146 million, an $87 million decrease in legal charges associated with a disputed 1999 legal settlement, partially offset by operating expense increases associated with the 2015 acquisitions of Omnicare and the pharmacies and clinics of Target, as well as increases in legal and strategic initiative costs.

Net Income and Earnings Per Share

Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $1.7 billion, an increase of $208 million or 13.8%. The increase in net income is primarily due to the $266 million increase in operating profit discussed above. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $5.3 billion, an increase of $80 million or 1.5%. The increase is primarily driven by the $884 million increase in operating profit discussed above, partially offset by the $643 million loss on early extinguishment of debt and an increase in interest expense of $220 million due to higher net borrowings during the year associated with the July 2015 $15 billion debt issuance. The Company benefited from a lower effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 38.0% versus 38.9% in the prior year period, and 38.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 versus 39.3% in the prior year. The lower effective income tax rates were primarily due to the resolution of income tax matters in open tax years through 2012, as well as other permanent items.

GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations (“GAAP diluted EPS”) for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $1.59 compared to $1.34 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share (“Adjusted EPS”) for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, was $1.71 and $1.53, respectively. Further detail is shown in the Adjusted Earnings Per Share reconciliation later in this release.

GAAP diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.91 compared to $4.62 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, was $5.84 and $5.16, respectively. Further detail is shown in the Adjusted Earnings Per Share reconciliation later in this release.

Guidance

The Company confirmed its previous EPS and cash flow guidance for the full year and first quarter of 2017. The Company expects to deliver GAAP diluted EPS of $5.02 to $5.18 and Adjusted EPS of $5.77 to $5.93 for the full year 2017. The Company expects to deliver GAAP diluted EPS of $0.82 to $0.88 and Adjusted EPS of $1.07 to $1.13 in the first quarter of 2017. The Company also confirmed its 2017 cash flow from operations guidance of $7.7 to $8.6 billion and free cash flow guidance of $6.0 to $6.4 billion. These 2017 guidance estimates assume the completion of $5.0 billion in share repurchases.

Mr. Merlo added, “As we outlined late last year, we have a four-point plan in place to return to more robust levels of growth in the years ahead. We remain confident in our model and our position in the evolving health care landscape. We can bring value to all health care stakeholders, helping them achieve their goals of making care more affordable, accessible, and effective.” 

Real Estate Program

During the three months ended December 31, 2016, the Company opened 40 new retail stores and closed 25 retail stores. In addition, the Company relocated 16 retail stores. As of December 31, 2016, the Company operated 9,709 retail stores, including pharmacies in Target stores, in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil.

As previously disclosed, the Company intends to close approximately 70 retail stores during 2017 and expects to take a charge of approximately $225 million associated with the remaining lease obligations of such stores. The vast majority of the store closures are expected to occur in the three months ending March 31, 2017. In connection with such anticipated store closures, the Company recorded a $34 million asset impairment charge in the three months ended December 31, 2016.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The following provides reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Form 8-K to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses the non-GAAP measures “Adjusted EPS” and “Free Cash Flow” to assess and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Management believes that providing these non-GAAP measures enhances investors’ understanding of the Company’s performance. 

The Company defines Adjusted Earnings per Share, or Adjusted EPS, as income from continuing operations excluding the impact of the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related transaction, integration and bridge financing costs, adjustments to legal reserves in connection with certain legal settlements, charges in connection with store rationalization, losses on early extinguishments of debt and losses on settlements of defined benefit pension plans divided by the Company’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The Company believes that this measure enhances investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance.

The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less net additions to property and equipment (i.e., additions to property and equipment plus proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions). Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for internal comparisons and finds it useful in assessing year-over-year cash flow performance. 

These non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, income before income tax provision as a measure of our performance. Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The Company’s definitions of Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies.

(2)Intersegment eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the Pharmacy Services Segment and the Retail/LTC Segment. These occur in the following ways: when members of Pharmacy Services Segment clients (“members”) fill prescriptions at our retail pharmacies to purchase covered products, when members enrolled in programs such as Maintenance Choice® elect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of our retail pharmacies instead of receiving them through the mail, or when members have prescriptions filled at our long-term care pharmacies. When these occur, both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments record the revenues, gross profit and operating profit on a standalone basis.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]
