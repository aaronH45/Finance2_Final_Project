As previously announced, on January 17, 2017, two wholly owned subsidiaries of Biogen Inc. (the “Company”), Biogen Swiss Manufacturing GmbH and Biogen International Holding Ltd. (collectively, “Biogen”), entered into a binding agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) with Forward Pharma A/S, a Danish limited liability company (“Forward Pharma”) and certain related parties (collectively, the “Additional Parties”) to enter into a Settlement and License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) subject to the approval of the License Agreement by at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the share capital represented at an extraordinary general meeting of Forward Pharma (“Shareholder Approval”) and other customary conditions. 

On February 1, 2017, Forward Pharma held an extraordinary general meeting at which Forward Pharma obtained Shareholder Approval, and all other conditions specified in the Letter Agreement have been satisfied. As a result, on that date, the License Agreement was deemed executed and effective pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Letter Agreement. 

For a description of the material terms of the License Agreement, please see the information set forth under Item 1.01 of the Company’s Form 8-K filed on January 17, 2017, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Biogen and Forward Pharma intend to permit the PTAB and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, as applicable, and the European Patent Office and the Technical Board of Appeal and/or the Enlarged Board of Appeal, as applicable, to make a final determination in the proceedings before them. 

The description of the License Agreement set forth under Item 1.01 of the Company’s Form 8-K filed on January 17, 2017, which is incorporated herein by reference, is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full and complete terms contained in the License Agreement, filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1.
