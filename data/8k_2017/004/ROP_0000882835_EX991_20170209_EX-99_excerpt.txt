Roper Technologies Announces 2016 Financial Results 

Fourth Quarter Revenue Increased 7%; Orders Increased 17% to $1.085 Billion 

Establishes 2017 Guidance 

Sarasota, Florida, February 9, 2017 ... Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: ROP), a diversified technology company, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2016. 

Roper reports results – including revenue, operating margin, net income and diluted earnings per share – on a GAAP basis and an adjusted basis. 

Fourth quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share (DEPS) were $1.78 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.86. GAAP revenue and adjusted revenue each increased 7% to $1.011 billion and $1.018 billion, respectively. Orders increased 17% to $1.085 billion. Compared to the prior year, GAAP gross margin increased 60 basis points to 62.0% and adjusted gross margin increased 50 basis points to 62.3%. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $270 million. 

"We are very pleased with our fourth quarter performance," said Brian Jellison, Roper's Chairman, President and CEO. "The execution of our strategies continued to deliver impressive cash flow results as full year adjusted operating cash flow exceeded $1 billion for the first time. Revenue increased 7%, including 2% organic growth, and we delivered a record $365 million of EBITDA in the quarter, representing 36% of revenue. Importantly, fourth quarter orders increased 17% to a record $1.1 billion and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.07, giving us confidence as we enter 2017." 

Full year GAAP diluted earnings per share were $6.43, a 6% decrease, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $6.57, a 2% decrease. GAAP revenue increased 6% to $3.79 billion and adjusted revenue increased 6% to $3.81 billion. Full year EBITDA was $1.31 billion, or 34.6% of adjusted revenue. Operating cash flow increased 4% to $964 million and adjusted operating cash flow increased 8% to $1.001 billion, representing 26% of revenue. 

"This was a transformational year for Roper on many levels," said Mr. Jellison. "We invested $3.7 billion in software acquisitions during the year, of which $3.4 billion was deployed during the fourth quarter to acquire two exceptional software companies: ConstructConnect and Deltek. Both businesses have favorable end market dynamics, terrific cash characteristics, substantial recurring revenue and outstanding leadership teams. Like many of our software businesses, ConstructConnect and Deltek operate with negative working capital, further accelerating our transformation as an asset-light, diversified technology company. Including these acquisitions, our software and network businesses are expected to contribute 50% of our EBITDA in 2017." 

2017 Outlook and Guidance 

Beginning in 2017, the Company's adjusted DEPS results and guidance will also exclude after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization. The Company believes reporting adjusted DEPS in this manner better reflects its core operating results and offers greater consistency and transparency. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is included at the end of this release. 

Roper expects 2017 full year adjusted DEPS between $8.82 and $9.22 with first quarter adjusted DEPS between $1.92 and $2.00. Full year adjusted revenue is expected to increase between 20% and 22% including organic revenue growth between 3% and 5%. 

The Company's guidance excludes the impact from future acquisitions or divestitures.
