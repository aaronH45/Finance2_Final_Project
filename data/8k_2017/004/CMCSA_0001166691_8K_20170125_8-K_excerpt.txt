The advance notice provisions for nominating directors to the Board, set forth in Section 3.10 of the By-Laws, have also been updated, along with certain clarifying and administrative changes. 

The foregoing description of the amendments to the By-Laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full and complete copy of the By-Laws, attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
