On February 9, 2017, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Tractor Supply Company ("the Company"), amended and restated the Company’s Fourth Amended and Restated By-laws (the “By-laws” and, as amended and restated, the “Amended By-laws”). The following is a brief summary of the material changes effected by adoption of the Amended By-laws, which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended By-laws filed as Exhibit 3.1(i) hereto.

1) The Board approved a proxy access procedure, set forth in new Article I, Section 1.2 of the Amended By-laws, pursuant to which a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years may nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials director candidates constituting up to the greater of two individuals or 20% of the Board, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the Amended By-laws. Notice of a nomination pursuant to the proxy access provisions of the Amended By-laws must be received no earlier than 150 days and no later than 120 days before the anniversary of the date that the Company distributed its proxy statement for the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders. Proxy access will first be available to stockholders in connection with the Company’s 2018 annual meeting of the stockholders.

2) The Amended By-laws amend Article I, Section 1.1 to provide that in order for a person to be eligible for election or re-election as a director, (i) the nominee will provide a written representation and agreement that the nominee acknowledges the Company’s policy on director resignations following such person’s failure to receive the required vote for re-election at any future meeting, (ii) the nominee will disclose whether he or she has entered into an agreement with a person other than the Company to receive direct or indirect compensation in connection with such person's candidacy as a director or in connection with such person’s service as a director, (iii) the nominee will provide a written representation that the nominee has not entered into any agreement or made a commitment to any person or entity as to how the nominee would vote on any matter as a director that has not been disclosed to the Company, and (iv) the nominee, if elected, will act in compliance with the Company's by-laws, corporate governance policies and code of conduct.

3) The Amended By-laws amend Article I, Section 1.1 to provide that a nominee must provide a written representation to the Company that he or she intends to serve the full term for which the nominee is standing for election.
