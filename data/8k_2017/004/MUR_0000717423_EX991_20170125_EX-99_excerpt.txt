 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES PRELIMINARY FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2016 FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS   

 ﻿  

 EL DORADO, Arkansas, January 25, 2017 – Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE: MUR) today announced its preliminary financial and operating results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, including a net loss of $64 million, or $0.37 per diluted share.   

 Operating and financial highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 include:  

   ·    Produced volumes of 168 Mboepd in the fourth quarter and 176 Mboepd for full year 

   ·    Spent $605 million on capital investments for full year, excluding acquisitions  

   ·    Lowered lease operating expense per barrel by approximately 15 percent year-over-year, excluding Syncrude  

   ·    Reduced selling and general expenses by approximately 14 percent year-over-year 

   ·    Generated $1.2 billion cash from non-core asset divestitures during the year 

   ·    Continued streamlining onshore portfolio by entering into an agreement to divest Canadian heavy oil asset at Seal  

   ·    Expanded exploration portfolio by farming into a successfully drilled prospect in the Gulf of Mexico as well as capturing a block in Mexico’s deepwater bid round 

 FOURTH QUARTER 2016 FINANCIAL RESULTS  

 Murphy incurred a net loss of $64 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2016. The company reported an adjusted loss, which excludes both the results of discontinued operations and certain other items that affect comparability of results between periods, of $27 million, or $0.16 per diluted share. Details for fourth quarter results can be found in the attached schedules.  

 During the quarter, the company recorded a $24 million after tax estimated redetermination expense related to an expected reduction in the company’s working interest covering the period from inception through year-end 2016 at the non-operated Kakap-Gumusut field in Block K Malaysia. The company expects to incur additional redetermination expense during 2017 for the period from the beginning of the year until the redetermination process is finalized, and the final adjustment will be settled in cash. The company is assuming that its working interest will be lowered, however, the amount of the reduction is not final until approved by Malaysian regulatory authorities.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from continuing operations totaled $221 million, or $14.24 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) sold. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and exploration expenses (EBITDAX) totaled $239 million, or $15.40 per boe sold.  

 Production in the fourth quarter 2016 averaged 168 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboepd). Stronger production compared to previous quarterly guidance is attributed to shorter downtime and better well performance following the planned Kikeh and Sarawak turnarounds, in addition to stronger well results from new wells brought online in the Catarina area of the Eagle Ford Shale.  

 “2016 was a year of improving the company’s North American onshore portfolio while surviving one of our industry’s worst commodity price collapses. We successfully monetized non-core assets, including Montney midstream and Syncrude, while entering into a new unconventional liquids play in the Kaybob Duvernay,” stated Roger W. Jenkins, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The company is now set up with a solid balance sheet, ample liquidity and stabilized production levels while maintaining our top quartile dividend yield within cash flow,” Jenkins added.  

 FULL YEAR 2016 FINANCIAL RESULTS  

 Murphy incurred a net loss of $276 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, for the full year 2016. The company reported an adjusted loss, which excludes both the results of discontinued operations and certain other items that affect comparability of results between periods, of $230 million, or $1.34 per diluted share. Details for full year 2016 results can be found in the attached schedules.  

 EBITDA from continuing operations totaled $804 million, or $12.59 per boe sold. EBITDAX totaled $906 million, or $14.18 per boe sold. Production for full year 2016 averaged 176 Mboepd.  

 The company continued to reduce costs over the course of the year. The full year 2016 lease operating expense was $7.87 per boe, excluding Syncrude, a 15 percent reduction from full year 2015. In addition, full year 2016 selling and general expenses declined approximately 14 percent from full year 2015 to $265 million.

 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND ASSET SALES  

 As of December 31, 2016, the company had $2.8 billion of outstanding fixed rate notes and $984 million in cash and liquid invested securities. The long term, fixed-rate notes, excluding the current maturity, have a weighted average maturity of 10.1 years and a weighted average coupon of 5.6 percent.  

 Murphy entered into an agreement during the fourth quarter to sell its heavy oil Seal asset for C$65 million to Baytex Energy Corp. The sale, which was subject to closing adjustments and other conditions typical of transactions of this nature, closed January 20, 2017. Over the course of 2016, Murphy has strategically divested non-core assets to reduce overall complexity and streamline its North American onshore portfolio. This will allow the company to focus on leveraging its expertise between three unconventional onshore plays along with concentrated offshore areas.   

 YEAR-END 2016 PROVED RESERVES  

 Murphy’s preliminary year-end 2016 proved reserves are 684.8 million barrels of oil equivalent (Mmboe) as compared to 774.0 Mmboe at year-end 2015. The change in year-over-year reserves is attributed to reductions of 121.4 Mmboe in divestitures and 64.3 Mmboe in production, combined with additions of 52.4 Mmboe in acquisitions and 44.1 Mmboe of other net extensions, discoveries and revisions. The 2016 reserve life index is 10.7 years. Final information related to the company’s year-end 2016 proved reserves will be provided in Murphy’s Form 10-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February.  

 REGIONAL OPERATIONS SUMMARY   

 North American Onshore  

 The North American onshore business produced over 86 Mboepd in the fourth quarter with 52 percent liquids and operating expenses of just over $7.00 per boe. For the full year, the onshore business produced 88 Mboepd at 53 percent liquids with operating expenses, excluding Syncrude, of just over $7.30 per boe.  

 Eagle Ford Shale – Production in the quarter averaged 46 Mboepd, which included 88 percent liquids, with 17 wells brought online. Full year production averaged 49 Mboepd with 53 wells brought online. This brings the company’s online operated well count to over 700 in the Eagle Ford Shale. The company continues to optimize its completion designs which are proving to yield increased productivity and are expected to continue to lead to higher estimated ultimate recoveries (EURs) field wide. Several new wells in the Catarina area are showing encouraging   

 3  

results, averaging 70 to 100 percent higher cumulative production than historical completions in the area over the same period.  

 Tupper Montney – Murphy averaged 204 million cubic feet per day (Mmcfd) of natural gas in the quarter and 200 Mmcfd for the full year. During the quarter, two new wells were brought online utilizing a longer lateral, higher sand concentration completion design. Along with the previous wells utilizing this similar design, the production profiles continue to support the increased type curve range of 10 to 14 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) with the latest wells projecting to exceed 17 Bcfe EURs.   

 Kaybob Duvernay – Production for the quarter averaged 3 Mboepd, which included 54 percent liquids. The four wells brought online in the gas condensate area in the third quarter, which were previously drilled by the joint venture partner, continue to perform at or above the normalized type curve. During the quarter Murphy drilled a two well pad, the first wells drilled since taking over operatorship, and these wells are expected to be brought online in the first quarter 2017. The drilling costs for these wells were competitive with peers in the area. At year-end, Murphy booked approximately 55 Mmboe attributed to this new asset, which puts the company ahead of its goal to replace the reserves sold at Syncrude last year.   

 Offshore   

 The offshore business produced over 81 Mboepd for the fourth quarter with 73 percent liquids and operating expenses just below $9.00 per boe. For the full year, the offshore business produced over 83 Mboepd with 73 percent liquids and operating expenses of $8.40 per boe.  

 Malaysia – Block K and Sarawak liquids averaged over 37 thousand barrels of liquids per day, while Sarawak natural gas production averaged over 115 Mmcfd during the fourth quarter. Full year production for Block K and Sarawak liquids averaged 39 thousand barrels of liquids per day while Sarawak natural gas averaged 106 Mmcfd. As scheduled, there were major turnarounds at the Kikeh floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) facility and Sarawak floating storage offloading (FSO) facility, cumulatively reducing production by approximately 4,900 boepd during the quarter. Both the Kikeh and Sarawak turnarounds were completed safely and ahead of schedule.  

 North America – Gulf of Mexico and East Coast Canada averaged over 23 Mboepd, comprised of 92 percent liquids, in the quarter. During the fourth quarter, Murphy reached an agreement with Chevron to participate in drilling Hoffe Park, a Gulf of Mexico Mississippi Canyon prospect in Block 166, with a 25 percent working interest. Chevron drilled the well late in the   

 4  

fourth quarter and successfully encountered hydrocarbons. The well operations have been suspended pending determination of the appraisal plan for the discovery.  

 Exploration – Murphy and its partners were the successful bidder in Mexico’s fourth phase, round one deepwater auction on Block 5, the most competitive block of the bid round. Under the terms of the joint venture, Murphy will be the operator with a 30 percent working interest. The block is located in the deepwater Salinas basin covering approximately 1,000 square miles and water depths in this block range from 2,300 to 3,600 feet. The initial exploration period for the license is four years and includes a work program commitment of one well.  

 2017 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND PRODUCTION GUIDANCE  

 Murphy is planning 2017 capital expenditures to be $890 million which assumes a West Texas Intermediate oil price of $52 per barrel and Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.10 per thousand cubic feet.  

 Approximately 65 percent of the total capital is being allocated towards the onshore unconventional businesses with a majority in the Eagle Ford Shale and Kaybob Duvernay. Offshore expenditures are focused on short-cycle projects that maintain existing assets and other activities expected to increase value-added production in future years. Field development and development drilling accounts for 85 percent of the annual capital expenditures.  

 Production for the first quarter 2017 is estimated in the range of 166 to 170 Mboepd with full year 2017 production to be in the range of 162 to 168 Mboepd. The North American onshore unconventional production is expected to be 55 percent of full year guidance. Full year production assumes an expected reduction following approval of the redetermination in the non-operated Kakap-Gumusut field in Malaysia. Details on guidance can be found in the attached schedules.  

 “Our focus in 2017 is three fold. First, allocating a majority of capital toward developing locations in the highest return areas in our onshore portfolio. Second, investing in selective offshore projects that deliver top quartile finding and development metrics. Third, covering all costs, including our dividend, within cash flow which will maintain our solid balance sheet,” Jenkins said. “Additionally, our activity in the Kaybob Duvernay is primarily targeting appraisal areas that will allow for further development plans to be formulated and ultimately support onshore value-added production growth complementing our Eagle Ford Shale and Montney assets,” Jenkins continued.
