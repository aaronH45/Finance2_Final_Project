On February 22, 2017, Sempra Energy’s (the “Company”) Board of Directors (the “Board”) appointed Andrés Conesa, age 47, and Bethany Jean Mayer, age 55, to serve on the Board. Mr. Conesa and Ms. Mayer were also named to serve on the Audit Committee and the Environmental, Health, Safety and Technology Committee, respectively. These appointments and committee assignments are effective on February 23, 2017.

On February 22, 2017, in addition to her role as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and a Director of the Company, the Board appointed Debra L.

Ms. Reed has been the Chief Executive Officer and a Director of the Company since 2011 and has been the Chairman of the Company since 2012. Ms. Reed also serves on the boards of Halliburton Company and Caterpillar Inc.
