Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. 

Cigna Corporation ("Cigna") reaffirms projected full year 2017 consolidated adjusted income from operations, which remains in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.48 billion.  

Cigna discussed its full year 2017 outlook in its press release dated February 2, 2017 and during the related investor conference call. The press release and the conference call transcript are available under Quarterly Reports and SEC Filings in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website located at www.cigna.com/aboutcigna/investors. 

Adjusted income (loss) from operations is defined as shareholders' net income (loss) excluding the following after-tax adjustments: net realized investment results, net amortization of other acquired intangible assets and special items. Adjusted income (loss) from operations is a measure of profitability used by Cigna's management because it presents the underlying results of operations of Cigna's businesses and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and shareholders' net income. This consolidated measure is not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income. Management is not able to provide a reconciliation to shareholders' net income (loss) on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, certain components thereof including (i) future net realized investment results and (ii) future special items. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. As such, any associated estimate and its impact on shareholders' net income could vary materially. The Company believes it is reasonably likely that a guaranty fund assessment related to Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary American Network Insurance Company will be finalized in 2017. Due to uncertainties surrounding this matter, the Company's share of this guaranty fund assessment is uncertain, but based on current information, is estimated to be approximately $85 million after tax. The Company expects to treat this guaranty fund assessment as a special item. 

This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act whether made before or after the date of this report, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 

This Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Report"), and oral statements made with respect to information contained in this Report, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on Cigna's current expectations and projections about future trends, events and uncertainties. These statements are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements may include, among others, statements relating to our projected full year 2017 consolidated adjusted income from operations as reflected in Item 7.01 of this Report, as well as statements made in our press release dated February 2, 2017 and related investor conference call concerning our projected adjusted income (loss) from operations outlook for 2017, on both a consolidated and segment basis; projected total revenue growth and global medical customer growth, each over year end 2016; projected medical care and operating expense ratios and medical cost trends; future financial or operating performance, including our ability to deliver personalized and innovative solutions for our customers and clients and future growth, business strategy, strategic or operational initiatives; economic, regulatory or competitive environments, particularly with respect to the pace and extent of change in these areas; financing or capital deployment plans and amounts available for future deployment; our prospects for growth in the coming years; statements regarding the merger agreement with Anthem and the transactions and litigation related thereto; statements regarding the timing of resolution of the issues raised by CMS; and other statements regarding Cigna's future beliefs, expectations, plans intentions, financial condition or performance. You may identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as "believe", "expect", "plan", "intend", "anticipate", "estimate", "predict", "potential", "may", "should", "will" or other words or expressions of similar meaning, although not all forward-looking statements contain such terms. 

Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to achieve our financial, strategic and operational plans or initiatives; our ability to predict and manage medical costs and price effectively and develop and maintain good relationships with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers; our ability to identify potential strategic acquisitions or transactions and realize the expected benefits of such strategic transactions; the substantial level of government regulation over our business and the potential effects of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations; the outcome of litigation, regulatory audits including the CMS review and sanctions, investigations, actions and guaranty fund assessments; uncertainties surrounding participation in government-sponsored programs such as Medicare; the effectiveness and security of our information technology and other business systems; unfavorable industry, economic or political conditions including foreign currency movements; ongoing litigation with respect to the ruling of the District Court enjoining the merger, including the appeal of that ruling; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement of the ruling enjoining the merger; uncertainty as to litigation with respect to the termination of the merger agreement, the reverse termination fee, declaratory judgments with respect to the foregoing and/or contract and non-contract damages for claims filed against Anthem; the risk that a government entity or court of competent jurisdiction, in any litigation, arbitration or other forum, finds in any binding or non-binding decision that Cigna has not complied, in full or in part, with its obligations under the merger agreement or that Cigna is liable for any breach, willful or otherwise, of the merger agreement; uncertainty as to whether and, if so, when Anthem will pay the reverse termination fee; uncertainty as to litigation with respect to the suit initiated by Anthem against Cigna, including for damages with respect to the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement; competitive responses to the ruling; the inability to retain key personnel; the timing and likelihood of completion of the proposed merger, including the timing, receipt and terms and conditions of any required governmental and regulatory approvals for the proposed merger that could reduce anticipated benefits or cause the parties to abandon the transaction; if the merger is consummated, the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation from the proposed merger will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; if the merger is consummated, the risk that the businesses of Cigna and Anthem will not be integrated successfully; disruption from the proposed merger making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; the risk that unexpected costs will be incurred; the possibility that the proposed merger does not close, including a failure to satisfy the closing conditions; the risk that financing for the proposed merger may not be available on favorable terms, as well as more specific risks and uncertainties discussed in our most recent report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K available on the Investor Relations section of www.cigna.com as well as on Anthem's most recent report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K available on the Investor Relations section of www.antheminc.com. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made, are not guarantees of future performance or results, and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Cigna undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.
