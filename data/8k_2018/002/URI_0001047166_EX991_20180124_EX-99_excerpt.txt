United Rentals Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results 

Provides 2018 Outlook and Estimated Impact of U.S. Tax Reform

STAMFORD, Conn. – January 24, 2018 – United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE: URI) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 20171. 

Fourth Quarter 2017

For the fourth quarter of 2017, total revenue was $1.922 billion and rental revenue was $1.646 billion, compared with $1.523 billion and $1.298 billion, respectively, for the same period the prior year. On a GAAP basis, the company reported fourth quarter net income of $897 million, or $10.45 per diluted share, compared with $153 million, or $1.80 per diluted share, for the same period the prior year. The fourth quarter of 2017 includes a net income benefit estimated at $689 million, or $8.03 per diluted share, associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 discussed below.

Adjusted EPS2 for the quarter was $11.37 per diluted share, compared with $2.67 for the same period the prior year. Excluding the estimated $8.03 per share benefit associated with the enacted tax reform discussed above, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been $3.34. Adjusted EBITDA2 was $947 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 49.3% for the quarter, compared with $749 million and 49.2%, respectively, for the same period the prior year.

Fourth Quarter Highlights[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

____________

1.The company completed the acquisitions of NES Rentals Holdings II, Inc. (“NES ”) and Neff Corporation ("Neff") in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. NES and Neff are included in the company's results subsequent to the acquisition dates. Pro forma results reflect the combination of United Rentals, NES and Neff for all periods presented.

2.Adjusted EPS (earnings per share) and adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of the items noted in the tables below. See the tables below for amounts and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue.

3.Rental revenue includes owned equipment rental revenue, re-rent revenue and ancillary revenue.

4.Used equipment sales adjusted gross margin excludes the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired RSC, NES and Neff fleet that was sold.

Full Year 2017 

For the full year 2017, total revenue was $6.641 billion and rental revenue was $5.715 billion, compared with $5.762 billion and $4.941 billion, respectively, for 2016. On a GAAP basis, full year net income was $1.346 billion, or $15.73 per diluted share, compared with $566 million, or $6.45 per diluted share, for 2016. 2017 includes a net income benefit estimated at $689 million, or $8.05 per diluted share, associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 discussed below.

Adjusted EPS for the full year was $18.64 per diluted share, compared with $8.65 per diluted share for 2016. Excluding the estimated $8.05 per share benefit associated with the enacted tax reform discussed above, adjusted EPS for 2017 would have been $10.59. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.164 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin was 47.6% for the full year, compared with $2.759 billion and 47.9%, respectively, for 2016.

Full Year Highlights[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The company issued $2.925 billion of debt due from 2025 through 2028. The proceeds from the debt issuances were primarily used to fund the NES and Neff acquisitions, and to redeem $1.4 billion of debt that would have been due in 2022 and 2023. The company additionally increased the sizes of its ABL and AR securitization facilities by $500 million and $150 million, respectively. 

CEO Comments

Michael Kneeland, chief executive officer of United Rentals, said, "We capped a year of record results with a strong fourth quarter finish on the back of broad-based demand. Pro forma volume increased nearly 9% year-over-year in the quarter, and rental rates were up 2%. For the full year, we exceeded the upper-band of guidance on total revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, and increased our ROIC by 50 basis points year-over-year to its highest level since 2015."

Kneeland continued, "Our 2018 guidance reflects the confidence we feel in our operating environment based on what we hear from customers and see in key leading indicators. Our optimism is further supported by the tailwinds we expect from leveraging our 2017 acquisitions and our ongoing investments in people and technology, as well as the recent U.S. tax reform. Our strategy remains focused on balancing growth and returns to maximize our long-term value."

2018 Outlook

The company provided the following outlook for the full year 2018. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Estimated Impact of U.S. Tax Reform 

While we continue to assess the full impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”), our preliminary analysis suggests we will meaningfully benefit from the legislation. In particular, the combination of a lower U.S. federal tax rate at 21% and the full expensing of capital spending will materially exceed the impact of the repeal of Like-Kind Exchange provisions, which had allowed for the deferral of taxable gains on the sale of used equipment. On a net basis, and leaving all other factors unchanged, we estimate that the reforms will benefit our 2018 free cash flow by at least $250 million, which is incorporated into our 2018 outlook. On a blended basis, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 25% in 2018. 

The Act impacted our 2017 results primarily due to (i) a one-time non-cash tax benefit estimated at $746 million, reflecting the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability using a U.S. federal tax rate of 21% and (ii) a one-time transition tax estimated at $57 million on our unremitted foreign earnings and profits, which we will elect to pay over an eight-year period. 

Free Cash Flow and Fleet Size

For the full year 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.230 billion, and free cash flow was $907 million after total rental and non-rental gross capital expenditures of $1.889 billion. For the full year 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.953 billion, and free cash flow was $1.182 billion after total rental and non-rental gross capital expenditures of $1.339 billion. Free cash flow for the full years 2017 and 2016 included aggregate merger and restructuring related payments of $76 million and $13 million, respectively.

The size of the rental fleet was $11.51 billion of original equipment cost at December 31, 2017, compared with $8.99 billion at December 31, 2016. The age of the rental fleet was 47.0 months on an OEC-weighted basis at December 31, 2017, compared with 45.2 months at December 31, 2016.

_____________

6.Information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to the comparable GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort, as discussed below.

Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) 

Return on invested capital was 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year. The company’s ROIC metric uses after-tax operating income for the trailing 12 months divided by average stockholders’ equity, debt and deferred taxes, net of average cash. To mitigate the volatility related to fluctuations in the company’s tax rate from period to period, the federal statutory tax rate of 35% is used to calculate after-tax operating income. When adjusting the denominator of the ROIC calculation to also exclude average goodwill, ROIC was 11.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 70 basis points year-over-year. 

If the 21% federal statutory tax rate following the enacted tax reform discussed above was applied to ROIC for the year ended December 31, 2017, we estimate that ROIC would have been approximately 10.7%. Going forward, we expect ROIC to materially increase from the 8.8% achieved in 2017 due to the enacted tax reform.

Share Repurchase Program

The company previously announced that it would resume its pre-existing $1 billion program to repurchase shares of its common stock (the “Program”). The Program commenced in November 2015 and was paused in October 2016 (at which point, the company had completed $627 million of repurchases under the Program) as the company evaluated potential acquisition opportunities. The company completed $28 million of repurchases under the Program in 2017, and intends to complete the remaining $345 million in 2018.

Conference Call 

United Rentals will hold a conference call tomorrow, Thursday, January 25, 2018, at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The conference call number is 855-458-4217 (international: 574-990-3618). The conference call will also be available live by audio webcast at unitedrentals.com, where it will be archived until the next earnings call. The replay number for the call is 404-537-3406, passcode is 7899997.

Non-GAAP Measures  

Free cash flow, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share (adjusted EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of rental and non-rental equipment plus proceeds from sales of rental and non-rental equipment and excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, (benefit) provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. Adjusted EPS represents EPS plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, the impact on interest expense related to the fair value adjustment of acquired RSC indebtedness, the impact on depreciation related to acquired fleet and property and equipment, the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet, merger related intangible asset amortization, asset impairment charge and the loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities and amendment of ABL facility. The company believes that: (i) free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements; (ii) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced; and (iii) adjusted EPS provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, none of these measures should be considered as alternatives to net income, cash flows from operating activities or earnings per share under GAAP as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. 

Information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The company is not able to provide reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the provision for income taxes. Preparation of such reconciliations would require a forward-looking balance sheet, statement of income and statement of cash flow, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such forward-looking financial statements are unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The company provides a range for its adjusted EBITDA forecast that it believes will be achieved, however it cannot accurately predict all the components of the adjusted EBITDA calculation. The company provides an adjusted EBITDA forecast because it believes that adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the company’s results under GAAP, provides useful information for the reasons noted above. However, adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity.

ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GAAP RECONCILIATION

We define “earnings per share – adjusted” as the sum of earnings per share – GAAP, as reported plus the impact of the following special items: merger related costs, merger related intangible asset amortization, impact on rental depreciation related to acquired fleet and property and equipment, impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet, impact on interest expense related to fair value adjustment of acquired RSC indebtedness, restructuring charge, asset impairment charge and loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities and amendment of ABL facility. Management believes that earnings per share - adjusted provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, earnings per share - adjusted is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, earnings per share - adjusted should not be considered an alternative to GAAP earnings per share. The table below provides a reconciliation between earnings per share – GAAP, as reported, and earnings per share – adjusted.

(2)Reflects transaction costs associated with the NES and Neff acquisitions discussed above. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future. Merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions that significantly impact our operations. The historic acquisitions that have included merger related costs are RSC, which had annual revenues of approximately $1.5 billion prior to the acquisition, and National Pump, which had annual revenues of over $200 million prior to the acquisition. NES had annual revenues of approximately $369 million, and Neff had annual revenues of approximately $413 million.

EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA GAAP RECONCILIATION

(In millions)

EBITDA represents the sum of net income, (benefit) provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment, and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company’s results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliation, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. The table below provides a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(A) Our EBITDA margin was 44.3% and 47.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 43.6% and 46.3% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

(B) Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 49.3% and 49.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 47.6% and 47.9% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

FREE CASH FLOW GAAP RECONCILIATION 

(In millions)

We define free cash flow as (i) net cash provided by operating activities less (ii) purchases of rental and non-rental equipment plus (iii) proceeds from sales of rental and non-rental equipment, and excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements. However, free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. Accordingly, free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. The table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements result from stock-based compensation windfall deductions in excess of the amounts reported for financial reporting purposes. We adopted accounting guidance in 2017 that changed the cash flow presentation of excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. In the table above, the excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements for 2017 are presented as a component of net cash provided by operating activities, while, for 2016, they are presented as a separate line item. Because we historically included the excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements in the free cash flow calculation, the adoption of this guidance did not change the calculation of free cash flow. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The table below provides a reconciliation between 2018 forecasted net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow.
