In conjunction with the Exchange Offers, Lennar, on behalf of CalAtlantic, is concurrently soliciting consents (each, a “Consent Solicitation” and, collectively, the “Consent Solicitations”), to adopt certain proposed amendments to each of the indentures governing the CalAtlantic Notes to eliminate certain covenants, restrictive provisions and events of default from such indentures. Each Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation is conditioned, among other things, upon the completion of the other Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, although Lennar may waive such conditions at any time with respect to an Exchange Offer. Any waiver of a condition by Lennar with respect to an Exchange Offer will automatically waive such condition with respect to the corresponding Consent Solicitation, as applicable.  

The Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations are being made pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offering memorandum and consent solicitation statement dated January 19, 2018, and are conditioned, among other things, upon the closing of the Merger and pursuant to the overall plan of reorganization of CalAtlantic. The closing of the Merger is expected to occur on February 12, 2018.  

Holders who validly tender their CalAtlantic Notes at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 1, 2018, unless extended (the “Early Tender Date”), will be eligible to receive the applicable Total Exchange Consideration as set forth in the table above, which includes the applicable Early Tender Payment as set forth in the table, for all such CalAtlantic Notes that are accepted. For each $1,000 principal amount of CalAtlantic Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date but prior to 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on February 16, 2018, unless extended (the “Expiration Date”), holders of CalAtlantic Notes will not be eligible to receive the applicable Early Tender Payment and, accordingly, will only be eligible to receive the applicable Exchange Consideration as set forth in the table above on the settlement date. The settlement date is expected to occur promptly after the Expiration Date and in any event within two business days after the Expiration Date, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions.  

Documents relating to the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations will only be distributed to eligible holders of CalAtlantic Notes who complete and return an eligibility form confirming that they are either a “qualified institutional buyer” under Rule 144A or not a “U.S. person” and outside the United States under Regulation S for purposes of applicable securities laws.
