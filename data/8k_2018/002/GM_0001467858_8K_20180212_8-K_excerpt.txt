ITEM 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

On February 12, 2018, General Motors Company's (the “Company”) controlled joint venture, GM Korea Company (“GM Korea”), announced its decision to cease production at and close its Gunsan Korea plant by the end of May 2018. In connection with this announcement, the Company expects to record pre-tax charges of up to $850 million, including approximately $475 million of non-cash asset impairments in the first quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. The remaining charges of up to $375 million are primarily attributable to termination benefits, substantially all of which will be recorded by the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and paid in cash. Future additional cash payments related to these charges are anticipated to be approximately $170 million, related to the payment of previously recorded pension obligations for separated employees. These charges will be considered special for EBIT-adjusted and EPS-diluted adjusted reporting purposes. 

ITEM 2.06 Material Impairments

The information set forth above, in response to Item 2.05, is incorporated by reference herein, in response to Item 2.06.
