 “Flowserve’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 adjusted results were largely in-line with our expectations. In the quarter, we achieved better than anticipated bookings growth, providing a solid foundation for growth in 2018,” said Scott Rowe, Flowserve’s president and chief executive officer. “Additionally, we are increasingly optimistic that our core energy end markets are positioned to inflect. We believe that the continued stability in oil price levels, global economic growth, completion of U.S. tax reform and an improved regulatory environment, have improved market conditions, which could support our customers increased spending on deferred maintenance and efficiency upgrades, as well as reaching investment decisions for larger projects.”  

 Lee Eckert, Flowserve’s senior vice president and chief financial officer, added, “Flowserve delivered strong operating cash flow of $239 million in the 2017 fourth quarter. We ended last year with cash and cash equivalents of over $700 million, a $200 million improvement from the 2017 third quarter levels. While we made progress last year, continuing to reduce our working capital will remain a major priority for the business going forward.”  

 Rowe concluded, “While we expect to benefit from stronger end-markets, we also continue to advance our Flowserve 2.0 strategy to streamline and simplify the business. I am confident Flowserve has tremendous opportunity ahead, and we expect to drive significant long-term value for our customers, employees and shareholders.”

 Flowserve’s 2018 Adjusted EPS target range excludes expected realignment charges of approximately $90 million, as well as the potential impact of below-the-line foreign currency effects and certain other discrete items. Both the Reported and the Adjusted EPS target range includes the expected revenue increase of approximately 3 to 6 percent year-over-year, and is based on current foreign currency rates and commodity prices, 2017 year-end backlog, expected bookings levels and market conditions, minimal impact from adoption of accounting pronouncements, the reset of annual incentive performance goals, a broad-based merit increase, modest above-the-line foreign currency benefits, net interest expense in the range of $58 to $60 million and a tax rate of 27 to 28 percent. The quarterly phasing of expected 2018 earnings is anticipated to reflect traditional seasonality, although more pronounced in its second half weighting.

 The forward-looking statements included in this news release are based on our current expectations, projections, estimates and assumptions. These statements are only predictions, not guarantees. Such forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from what is forecast in such forward-looking statements, and include, without limitation, the following: a portion of our bookings may not lead to completed sales, and our ability to convert bookings into revenues at acceptable profit margins; changes in global economic conditions and the potential for unexpected cancellations or delays of customer orders in our reported backlog; our dependence on our customers’ ability to make required capital investment and maintenance expenditures; risks associated with cost overruns on fixed-fee projects and in taking customer orders for large complex custom engineered products; the substantial dependence of our sales on the success of the oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water management industries; the adverse impact of volatile raw materials prices on our products and operating margins; our ability to execute and realize the expected financial benefits from our strategic manufacturing optimization and realignment initiatives; economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations, including military actions or trade embargoes that could affect customer markets, particularly North African, Russian and Middle Eastern markets and global oil and gas producers, and non-compliance with U.S. export/re-export control, foreign corrupt practice laws, economic sanctions and import laws and regulations; increased aging and slower collection of receivables, particularly in Latin America and other emerging markets; our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including in hyperinflationary countries such as Venezuela; our furnishing of products and services to nuclear power plant facilities and other critical processes; potential adverse consequences resulting from litigation to which we are a party, such as litigation involving asbestos-containing material claims; a foreign government investigation regarding our participation in the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program; expectations regarding acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses; our ability to anticipate and manage cybersecurity risk, including the risk of potential business disruptions or financial losses; our relative geographical profitability and its impact on our utilization of deferred tax assets, including foreign tax credits; the potential adverse impact of an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets; our dependence upon third-party suppliers whose failure to perform timely could adversely affect our business operations; the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we operate; environmental compliance costs and liabilities; potential work stoppages and other labor matters; our inability to protect our intellectual property in the U.S., as well as in foreign countries; obligations under our defined benefit pension plans; our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud; and other factors described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain non-recurring items present additional useful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods, providing investors with a clearer view of the underlying trends of the business. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, planning and compensation decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. Throughout our materials we refer to non-GAAP measures as “Adjusted.” Non-GAAP financial measures, which may be inconsistent with similarly captioned measures presented by other companies, should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
