Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

On February 8, 2018, we increased the size of the Mondelēz International Board of Directors (the “Board”) from 13 to 14 members and appointed Debra A. Crew and Peter W. May to the Board, effective March 1, 2018. The Board has not yet determined to which committees it will appoint Ms. Crew and Mr. May. On February 12, 2018, Nelson Peltz resigned from the Board, effective March 1, 2018.  

Ms. Crew and Mr. May will be included in our slate of nominees for election to the Board at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.  

Ms. Crew and Mr. May will receive the same compensation and indemnification as our other non-employee directors. The compensation program is described in our Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 28, 2017. The form of indemnification agreement is an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 9, 2018.  

There are no transactions between either Ms. Crew or Mr. May and us that would be reportable under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.  

Neither Ms. Crew nor Mr. May was selected pursuant to any arrangement or understanding between her or him and any other person. Although Mr. Peltz and Mr. May are affiliated with Trian Fund Management, L.P. (“Trian”), Trian does not have a contractual or other right to nominate any individual to the Board.  

A copy of our press release regarding these events is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
