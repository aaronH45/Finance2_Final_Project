“Across Boeing our teams delivered a record year of financial and operational performance as they focused on disciplined execution of production and development programs, growing services, and delivering value to customers,” said Boeing Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg. “That performance enables increased investments in our people and our business, and greater cash return to shareholders.”

"In 2017 we delivered the first 737 MAX airplanes, launched the 737 MAX 10 and completed the 787-10 first flight, all while delivering more commercial airplanes than ever before. We flew the first KC-46 Tanker to be delivered to the U.S. Air Force, were awarded an initial contract for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program, and a contract to provide 36 F-15 fighters to Qatar. We launched Boeing Global Services during the year, to deliver greater lifecycle value, and achieved growth that outpaced the market." 

“We actively positioned for future markets and growth by developing new products and services, investing to build vertical capabilities, launching the HorizonX innovation organization and bringing in new capabilities, including the acquisition of Aurora Flight Sciences. Looking forward, our team remains focused on winning through innovation, driving growth and productivity and extending our position as the world's leading aerospace company – delivering the best value to our customers, our employees and our shareholders."

Operating cash flow in the quarter of $2.9 billion was driven by strong operating performance (Table 2). During the quarter, the company repurchased 6.7 million shares for $1.7 billion and paid $0.8 billion in dividends. For the full year, the company repurchased 46.1 million shares for $9.2 billion and paid $3.4 billion in dividends. Based on strong cash generation and confidence in the company's outlook, the board of directors in December increased the quarterly dividend per share by 20 percent and replaced the existing share repurchase program with a new $18 billion authorization. Share repurchases under the new authorization are expected to be made over the next 24 to 30 months.

Additional Financial Information

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

At quarter-end, Boeing Capital's net portfolio balance was $3.0 billion. Total pension expense for the fourth quarter was $105 million, down from $434 million in the same period of the prior year. Revenue in other unallocated items and eliminations increased primarily due to timing of eliminations of intercompany aircraft deliveries, including those accounted for under operating lease. Earnings attributed to other unallocated items and eliminations decreased primarily due to higher deferred compensation. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter reflects the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted into law in December 2017, which reduced income tax expense by $1,051 million and increased fourth-quarter earnings per share by $1.74, primarily due to the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%.

Outlook

The Company is adopting two new accounting standards, as previously planned, in the first quarter of 2018, the revenue recognition standard (ASC 606) and the pension and postretirement accounting changes (ASC 715). Additional exhibits are included on pages 15-18 with restated 2017 and 2016 results adjusted for the adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 715. The Company has provided this comparable information in the exhibits and below to help investors understand the 2018 financial outlook (Table 8).

Non-GAAP Measures Disclosures

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company’s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided: 

Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share 

Core operating earnings is defined as GAAP earnings from operations excluding unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense. Core operating margin is defined as core operating earnings expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings per share is defined as GAAP diluted earnings per share excluding the net earnings per share impact of unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense. Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense represents the portion of pension and other post-retirement costs that are not recognized by business segments for segment reporting purposes. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to Commercial Airplanes and BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings/per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude unallocated pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided on page 14. 

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is defined as GAAP operating cash flow without capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment additions. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. Table 2 provides a reconciliation between GAAP operating cash flow and free cash flow.

Adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 715

We are adopting Accounting Standards Update Nos. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) and ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (ASC 715) in the first quarter of 2018. The following definition reflects the changes to Non-GAAP measures as a result of the adoption of those standards.

Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share 

Core operating earnings is defined as GAAP earnings from operations excluding the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core operating margin is defined as core operating earnings expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings per share is defined as GAAP diluted earnings per share excluding the net earnings per share impact of the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to Commercial Airplanes and BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings/per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude non-service pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided on pages 17-18.
