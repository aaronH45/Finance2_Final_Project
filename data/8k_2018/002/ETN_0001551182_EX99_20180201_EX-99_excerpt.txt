 DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 1, 2018--Power management company Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) today announced that net income and adjusted earnings per share were $1.43 for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings per share excludes $1 million of acquisition integration charges recorded in the quarter. Excluding income in the quarter of $62 million related to the new U.S. tax bill, net income and adjusted earnings per share were $1.29, up 15 percent over the fourth quarter of 2016.  

 Sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $5.2 billion, up 7 percent over the same period in 2016. The sales increase consisted of 5 percent growth in organic sales and 2 percent increase from positive currency translation.  

 Craig Arnold, Eaton chairman and chief executive officer, said, “We had a strong fourth quarter, with revenues above the high end of our guidance range, and net income and adjusted earnings per share, excluding the impact of the new U.S. tax bill, at the high end of our guidance range. Coming into the quarter, we expected organic sales would be up between 3 and 4 percent and currency translation would add 1½ percent growth. Our organic sales ended up growing 5 percent, and positive currency translation impacted sales 2 percent. The 5 percent organic growth was our highest quarterly rate of growth during 2017.  

 “The impact of the new U.S. tax bill was income of $62 million in the fourth quarter,” said Arnold. “Marking our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower tax rate created $79 million of income, which was offset by a $17 million charge for the mandatory repatriation tax.  

 “Our orders in the fourth quarter grew rapidly in every segment,” said Arnold. “Segment margins in the fourth quarter were a record 16.5 percent. Excluding restructuring costs in the segments of $36 million in the quarter, segment margins were 17.1 percent.  

 “Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $879 million,” said Arnold. “We continued to return substantial cash to our shareholders, repurchasing $61 million of our shares in the quarter, making our full year repurchases a total of $850 million, 2.5 percent of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.”  

 For full year 2017, sales were $20.4 billion, 3 percent higher than 2016. Net income and adjusted earnings per share were $6.68. Excluding the gain on the Cummins JV and the income arising from the new tax bill, net income and adjusted earnings per share were $4.65 per share, up 11 percent and 10 percent, respectively, over 2016. Operating cash flow in 2017 was a record $2.7 billion. Excluding $350 million contributed to our U.S. qualified pension plans during the year, operating cash flow was $3.0 billion.  

 “Looking at 2018, we expect our organic revenues to grow approximately 4 percent,” said Arnold. “We anticipate segment margins to be between 16.3 and 16.9 percent, a significant step up from 15.8 percent in 2017.  

 “We expect 2018 net income and adjusted earnings per share to be between $5.00 and $5.20, representing at the midpoint a 10 percent increase over 2017, excluding the gain on the Cummins JV and the income arising from the new tax bill in 2017,” said Arnold. “We anticipate net income and adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 to be between $1.00 and $1.10.”

 EATON CORPORATION plc

NOTES TO THE FOURTH QUARTER 2017 EARNINGS RELEASE  

 Amounts are in millions of dollars unless indicated otherwise (per share data assume dilution).  

 Note 1. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

 This earnings release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. These financial measures include adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per ordinary share, net income and adjusted earnings per ordinary share excluding the gain on the sale of a business and income from the new United States (U.S.) tax bill, and operating profit before acquisition integration charges for each business segment as well as corporate, each of which differs from the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of each of these financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in this earnings release. Management believes that these financial measures are useful to investors because they exclude certain transactions, allowing investors to more easily compare Eaton Corporation plc's (Eaton or the Company) financial performance period to period. Management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the on-going performance of Eaton and each business segment.  

 Net income and adjusted earnings per ordinary share of $1.43 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $1.29 excluding $0.14 per share of income from the new U.S. tax bill. Net income and adjusted earnings per ordinary share of $6.68 for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $4.65 excluding $1.89 per share from the gain on the sale of the business related to the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies joint venture and $0.14 per share of income from the new U.S. tax bill.  

 Note 2. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY  

 During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company changed its method of accounting for certain inventory in the United States from the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the first-in, first out (FIFO) method. The FIFO method of accounting for inventory is preferable because it conforms the Company's entire inventory to a single method of accounting and improves comparability with the Company's peers. All prior periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted to apply the new method of accounting.  

 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA"), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, would have required $14 of additional tax expense to adjust the deferred tax asset related to the LIFO reserve to the new tax rate if inventories continued to be computed under the LIFO method. The change from the LIFO method to the FIFO method eliminated the need to record this $14 of additional tax expense.  

 The following financial statement line items within the accompanying financial statements were adjusted, as follows:

 Note 3. SALE OF A BUSINESS  

 On July 31, 2017, Eaton sold a 50% interest in its heavy-duty and medium-duty commercial vehicle automated transmission business for $600 in cash to Cummins, Inc. The new joint venture is named Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $1,077, of which $533 related to the pre-tax gain from the $600 proceeds from the sale and $544 related to the Company’s remaining 50% investment in the joint venture being remeasured to fair value. The after-tax gain was $843, or $1.89 per share. The fair value is based on the price paid to Eaton for the 50% interest sold to Cummins, Inc. and further supported by a discounted cash flow model. Eaton will account for its investment on the equity method of accounting.

 *Operating profit excluding acquisition integration charges is used to calculate operating margin where that term is used in this release.  

 Business segment acquisition integration charges in 2017 related to the integration of Ephesus Lighting, Inc. (Ephesus), which was acquired in 2015. The charges associated with Ephesus were included in Selling and administrative expense. Business segment acquisition integration charges in 2016 related to the integration of Ephesus and Oxalis Group Ltd. (Oxalis), which was acquired in 2015. The charges associated with Ephesus were included in Cost of products sold and Selling and administrative expense, while the charges associated with Oxalis were included in Cost of products sold.  

 Note 5. UNITED STATES TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT  

 The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was expense of 0.2% compared to expense of 9.1% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes an estimated tax benefit of $62 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The $62 tax benefit related to the TCJA is comprised of a $79 tax benefit for adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities, offset by a $17 tax expense for the taxation of unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries owned directly or indirectly by U.S. subsidiaries of Eaton. Excluding the impact of the TCJA, the tax rate for the fourth quarter was expense of 10.0%. The increase in the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was due to greater levels of income in higher tax jurisdictions.  

 The effective income tax rate for full year 2017 was expense of 11.3% compared to expense of 9.4% for full year 2016. The tax rate for full year 2017 includes $234 of tax expense on the gain related to the Eaton Cummins JV transaction, which closed during the third quarter, and a tax benefit of $62 related to the TCJA. Excluding the gain and related tax impact on the Eaton Cummins JV transaction, and the impact of the TCJA, the tax rate for full year 2017 was expense of 9.2%. The decrease from 9.4% for the full year 2016 compared to 9.2% for the full year 2017 was due to the resolution of tax contingencies in various tax jurisdictions and the excess tax benefits recognized for employee share-based payments pursuant to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
