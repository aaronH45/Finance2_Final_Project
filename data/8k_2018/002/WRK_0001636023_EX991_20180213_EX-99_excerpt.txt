| 19 Non - GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share We use the non - GAAP financial measure “adjusted earnings per diluted share,” also referred to as “adjusted earnings per share” o r “Adjusted EPS” because we believe this measure provides our board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and ot hers with useful information to evaluate our performance since it excludes restructuring and other costs, net, and other specific items that w e b elieve are not indicative of our ongoing operating results. Our management and board of directors use this information to evaluate our perf orm ance relative to other periods. Adjusted Operating Cash Flow We use the non - GAAP financial measure “adjusted operating cash flow” because we believe this measure provides our board of direc tors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate our performance since it e xcl udes restructuring and other costs, net, and other specific items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating results. While th is measure is similar to adjusted free cash flow, we believe it provides greater comparability across periods when capital expenditures are changing s inc e it excludes an adjustment for capital expenditures. We believe the most directly comparable GAAP measure is net cash provided by operating act ivities. Adjusted Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA Margins We use the non - GAAP financial measures “adjusted segment EBITDA” and “adjusted segment EBITDA margins”, along with other factors , to evaluate our segment performance against the performance of our peers. We believe that investors also use these measures to eva luate our performance relative to our peers. We calculate adjusted segment EBITDA for each segment by adding that segment’s adjusted s egm ent income to its depreciation, depletion and amortization. We calculate adjusted segment EBITDA margin for each segment by divi din g that segment’s adjusted segment EBITDA by its adjusted segment sales.   

| 20 Non - GAAP Financial Measures (cont.) Leverage Ratio We use the non - GAAP financial measure “leverage ratio” as a measurement of our operating performance and to compare to our publi cly disclosed target leverage ratio, and because we believe investors use this measure to evaluate our available borrowing capaci ty. We define leverage ratio as our Total Funded Debt divided by our Credit Agreement EBITDA, each of which term is defined in our credit a gre ement, dated July 1, 2015. Borrowing capacity under our credit agreement depends on, in addition to other measures, the Credit Agreement Deb t/EBITDA ratio or the leverage ratio. As of the December 31, 2017 calculation, our leverage ratio was 2.45 ti mes. While the leverage ratio under our credit agreement determines the credit spread on our debt, we are not subject to a leverage ratio cap. Our credit agreement is subj ect to a Debt to Capitalization and Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined therein. Forward - looking Guidance We are not providing forward - looking guidance for U.S. GAAP reported financial measures or a reconciliation of forward - looking n on - GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure because we are unable to predict with reasonable certain ty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items without unreasonable effort. These items include, but are not limited to, merger and acq uis ition - related expenses, restructuring expenses, asset impairments, litigation settlements, changes to contingent consideration and certain oth er gains or losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the guidance period.
