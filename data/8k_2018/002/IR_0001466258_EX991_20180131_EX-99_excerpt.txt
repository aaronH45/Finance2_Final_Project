“The Ingersoll Rand team has delivered another year of solid execution and financial results, including generating further growth in revenues, operating income and adjusted EPS,” said Michael W. Lamach, chairman and chief executive officer. “In 2017, we exceeded the top end of our original earnings per share guidance range, grew market share in key businesses and delivered strong free cash flow of 118 percent of adjusted net income. We executed well on our dynamic capital allocation plans, raised dividends by 12.5 percent, committed $460 million to strategic acquisitions and deployed $1 billion to share repurchases. My thanks to our global team members for serving our customers and generating solid results.

“In 2018 our strategy remains consistent,” he said. “We have healthy markets and leading brands that are well positioned for growth. We expect our business operating system to deliver strong operating leverage and powerful free cash flow. We will execute a balanced capital allocation strategy that best uses our cash to drive long-term sustainable value for shareholders.”

*Non-GAAP measures definitions

Organic bookings is defined as reported orders closed/completed in the current period adjusted for the impact of currency and acquisitions. Organic revenue is defined as GAAP net revenues adjusted for the impact of currency and acquisitions. 

Currency impacts on net revenues and bookings are measured by applying the prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates to the current period’s net revenues and bookings reported in local currency. This measure allows for a direct comparison of operating results excluding the year-over-year impact of foreign currency translation.

Adjusted operating income is defined as GAAP operating income plus restructuring expenses in 2017 and 2016. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures on tables 3 and 4 of the news release.

Adjusted operating margin is defined as the ratio of adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.

In 2017 Adjusted continuing EPS is defined as GAAP continuing EPS plus restructuring expenses, net of tax impacts, plus the discrete non-cash tax adjustment in Latin America less U.S. tax legislation and other discrete items. In 2016 Adjusted continuing EPS is defined as GAAP continuing EPS plus restructuring expenses and a legal settlement, less the gain from the sale of the company’s remaining interest in Hussmann, net of tax impacts. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures on tables 3 and 4 of the news release.

Cash flow return on invested capital (“Cash flow ROIC”) is defined as annual free cash flow divided by the sum of gross fixed assets, receivables and inventory less accounts payables.

Free cash flow in 2017 and 2016 is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus cash payments for restructuring. Please refer to the free cash flow reconciliation on table 9 of the news release.

Working capital measures a firm’s operating liquidity position and its overall effectiveness in managing the enterprises’ current accounts. 

•Working capital is calculated by adding net accounts and notes receivables and inventories and subtracting total current liabilities that exclude short term debt, dividend payables and income tax payables. 

•Working capital as a percent of revenue is calculated by dividing the working capital balance (e.g. as of December 31) by the annualized revenue for the period (e.g. reported revenues for the three months ended December 31) multiplied by 4 to annualize for a full year.

Adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 is defined as the ratio of income tax expense, plus or minus the tax effect of adjustments for restructuring costs and the discrete non-cash tax adjustment in Latin America, U.S. tax legislation and other discrete items, divided by earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus restructuring expenses. Adjusted effective tax rate for 2016 is defined as the ratio of income tax expense, plus or minus the tax effect of adjustments for restructuring costs, a legal settlement and the gain on sale of Hussmann interest, divided by earnings from continuing operations before income taxes less the gain on sale of Hussmann interest plus restructuring expenses and a legal settlement. This measure allows for a direct comparison of the effective tax rate between periods. 

*** Accounting for the Tax Effects of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

The Company has not completed the accounting for the tax effects of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act); however, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), the Company has made reasonable estimates of the effects the Act has on existing deferred tax balances, the tax owed on the one-time transition tax and the change in permanent reinvestment assertion related to unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. In the aggregate, the Company recognized a provisional tax benefit for the above items of $21.0 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. Any changes to these provisional amounts will be reported in the period in which the proper accounting under ASC 740 is complete but in no case will that period be longer than the one year measurement period from the enactment date of the Act as required by SAB 118.

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). This supplemental schedule provides non-GAAP financial information and a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non-GAAP financial measures and the financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.

The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, not a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. They have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of our businesses as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these measures may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures reported by other companies.

We believe the non-GAAP financial information provides important supplemental information to both management and investors regarding financial and business trends used in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.

The non-GAAP financial measures associated with operating income and margin, tax rate and EPS assist investors with analyzing our business segment results as well as with predicting future performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are also reviewed by management in order to evaluate the financial performance of each segment. They are the basis for performance reviews, compensation and resource allocation. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as management.

As a result, one should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis, prominently disclosing GAAP results and providing reconciliations from GAAP results to non-GAAP results.
