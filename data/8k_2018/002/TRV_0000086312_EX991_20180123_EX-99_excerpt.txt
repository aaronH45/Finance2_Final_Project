New York, January 23, 2018 — The Travelers Companies, Inc. today reported net income of $551 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $943 million, or $3.28 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. Net income in the quarter included a charge of $129 million related to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). Net income in the quarter also included net realized investment gains of $70 million pre-tax ($47 million after-tax), as compared to $35 million pre-tax ($24 million after-tax) in the prior year quarter. Core income in the current quarter was $633 million, or $2.28 per diluted share, compared to $919 million, or $3.20 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. The decrease in core income was primarily driven by significantly higher catastrophe losses and a benefit in the prior year quarter of $126 million pre-tax ($82 million after-tax) from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute. These impacts to core income were partially offset by higher net favorable prior year reserve development in the current quarter. Per diluted share amounts benefited from the impact of share repurchases.

“We were pleased to report fourth quarter core income of $633 million and core return on equity of 11.1%, particularly in light of the high level of catastrophe losses arising out of the California wildfires,” commented Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The consolidated underlying combined ratio remained strong at 92.4% as our commercial business continued to perform well and results in our personal auto business improved meaningfully due to the successful execution of the pricing and underwriting actions we began implementing a year ago. Our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $467 million after-tax, benefiting once again from strong private equity returns. These results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to return $549 million of excess capital to shareholders this quarter, including $351 million of share repurchases. For the full year, we returned over $2.2 billion to shareholders, including over $1.4 billion in share repurchases. 

“We grew net written premiums by 6% in the quarter, including 5% in our commercial businesses and 8% in Personal Insurance, as we successfully executed our marketplace strategies in an improving pricing environment. In Business Insurance, domestic renewal premium change was 4%, the highest level in three years. We achieved rate increases more broadly across our product portfolio while maintaining retention at historically high levels, and we increased new business levels over the prior year quarter. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, domestic surety premiums increased 13% and retention in our domestic management liability business remained at record highs. In Personal Insurance, we achieved our dual objectives of double-digit renewal premium change in auto and continued growth in our industry-leading homeowners business. 

“In a year of extremely high catastrophe losses for the industry, our ability to generate full year core income of $2.043 billion and core return on equity of 9.0% demonstrates the value of our franchise and our consistent capital management strategy. From a position of strength, we continue to invest in our competitive advantages, focusing on extending our lead in risk expertise, improving the experience for customers, agents and brokers, and enhancing productivity and efficiency. We are encouraged by the pricing environment, the opportunities afforded by a more level playing field for domestic insurers as a result of corporate tax reform and the prospect of a strengthening economy. We remain well positioned to continue to deliver shareholder value.” 

Consolidated Results 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth Quarter 2017 Results 

(All comparisons vs. fourth quarter 2016, unless noted otherwise) 

Net income of $551 million after-tax decreased $392 million due to lower core income and a charge of $129 million related to the passage of the TCJA, partially offset by higher net realized investment gains. Net realized investment gains were $70 million pre-tax ($47 million after-tax), as compared to $35 million pre-tax ($24 million after-tax) in the prior year quarter. Core income of $633 million after-tax decreased $286 million, primarily due to the impact of significantly higher catastrophe losses and a benefit in the prior year quarter of $126 million pre-tax ($82 million after-tax) from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute. These impacts to core income were partially offset by higher net favorable prior year reserve development. 

2 

Underwriting results: 

· The combined ratio of 95.5% increased 5.5 points due to higher catastrophe losses (5.3 points) and a higher underlying combined ratio (0.4 points), partially offset by higher net favorable prior year reserve development (0.2 points). 

· The underlying combined ratio remained strong at 92.4%. 

· Net favorable prior year reserve development occurred in all segments. Catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter of 2017 included $656 million pre-tax ($426 million after-tax) arising out of wildfires in California, partially offset by favorable development of $157 million pre-tax ($102 million after-tax) primarily related to the third quarter 2017 hurricanes. 

Net investment income of $601 million pre-tax ($467 million after-tax) decreased 4%. Private equity returns remained strong but were lower than the prior year quarter, while fixed income returns declined in line with our expectations due to lower reinvestment rates available in the market. 

Net written premiums of $6.424 billion increased 6%, reflecting growth in all segments. Retention remained high and renewal premium change improved across all segments, while new business increased in our commercial businesses. 

Full Year 2017 Results 

(All comparisons vs. full year 2016, unless noted otherwise) 

Net income of $2.056 billion after-tax decreased $958 million due to lower core income and a $129 million charge related to the passage of the TCJA, partially offset by higher net realized investment gains. Net realized investment gains were $216 million pre-tax ($142 million after-tax) in the current year, as compared to $68 million pre-tax ($47 million after-tax) in the prior year. Core income of $2.043 billion after-tax decreased $924 million, primarily due to the impact of significantly higher catastrophe losses, lower net favorable prior year reserve development, a lower underlying underwriting gain (i.e., excluding net favorable prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses) and a benefit in the prior year of $126 million pre-tax ($82 million after-tax) from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute. These impacts to core income were partially offset by higher net investment income. In addition, income tax expense in the current year was reduced by $39 million as a result of the resolution of prior year tax matters. 

Underwriting results: 

· The combined ratio of 97.9% increased 5.9 points due to higher catastrophe losses (4.0 points), a higher underlying combined ratio (1.0 point), and lower net favorable prior year reserve development (0.9 points). 

· The underlying combined ratio of 92.6% increased 1.0 point, primarily driven by loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing in Business Insurance, a high level of non-catastrophe fire-related losses in Business Insurance and higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses in Personal Insurance, partially offset by a lower expense ratio. 

· Net favorable prior year reserve development occurred in all segments. Catastrophe losses in 2017 primarily resulted from wildfires in California, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and several winter, wind and hail storms throughout the United States. 

Net investment income of $2.397 billion pre-tax ($1.872 billion after-tax) increased 4% driven by higher private equity returns, partially offset by fixed income returns that declined in line with our expectations due to lower reinvestment rates available in the market. 

Record net written premiums of $26.219 billion increased 5% due to the same factors described above for fourth quarter 2017. 

Shareholders’ Equity 

Shareholders’ equity of $23.731 billion increased 2% from year-end 2016. Net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders’ equity were $1.414 billion pre-tax ($1.112 billion after-tax), compared to $1.112 billion pre-tax ($730 million after-tax) at year-end 2016. Book value per share of $87.46 and adjusted book value per share of $83.36 increased 5% and 4%, respectively, from year-end 2016. 

The Company repurchased 2.6 million shares during the fourth quarter at an average price of $133.69 per share for a total cost of $351 million. Capacity remaining under the existing share repurchase authorization was $4.556 billion at the end of the quarter. At the end of fourth quarter 2017, statutory capital and surplus was $20.448 billion and the ratio of debt-to-capital was 21.7%. The ratio of debt-to-capital excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders’ equity was 22.5%, within the Company’s target range of 15% to 25%. 

The Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.72 per share. This dividend is payable on March 30, 2018, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 9, 2018.

Fourth Quarter 2017 Results 

(All comparisons vs. fourth quarter 2016, unless noted otherwise) 

Segment income for Business Insurance was $637 million after-tax, a decrease of $64 million, primarily driven by lower other income due to a benefit in the prior year quarter of $126 million pre-tax ($82 million after-tax) from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute. 

Underwriting results:

Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the segment’s international operations in Europe primarily resulted from the UK Ministry of Justice’s “Ogden” discount rate adjustment applied to lump sum bodily injury payouts. 

Other income in the prior year included a $126 million pre-tax ($82 million after-tax) benefit from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute and the favorable settlement of a claims-related legal matter.

Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following:

· the Company’s investment portfolio is subject to credit risk, and may suffer material realized or unrealized losses. The Company’s investment portfolio may also suffer reduced or low returns, particularly if interest rates remain at historically low levels for a prolonged period of time or decline further as a result of actions taken by central banks (a risk which potentially could be increased by, among other things, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union); 

· the Company’s business could be harmed because of its potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation; 

8

· within the United States, the Company’s businesses are heavily regulated by the states in which it conducts business, including licensing, market conduct and financial supervision, and changes in regulation may reduce the Company’s profitability and limit its growth; 

· a downgrade in the Company’s claims-paying and financial strength ratings could adversely impact the Company’s business volumes, adversely impact the Company’s ability to access the capital markets and increase the Company’s borrowing costs; 

· the inability of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company’s holding company in sufficient amounts would harm the Company’s ability to meet its obligations, pay future shareholder dividends and/or make future share repurchases; 

· the Company’s efforts to develop new products, expand in targeted markets, or improve business processes and workflows may not be successful and may create enhanced risks; 

· the Company may be adversely affected if its pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results; 

· the Company’s business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology, particularly as our business processes become more digital; 

· if the Company experiences difficulties with technology, data and network security (including as a result of cyber attacks), outsourcing relationships, or cloud-based technology, the Company’s ability to conduct its business could be negatively impacted; 

· the Company is also subject to a number of additional risks associated with its business outside the United States, including foreign currency exchange fluctuations and restrictive regulations, as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union; 

· regulatory changes outside of the United States, including in Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union, could adversely impact the Company’s results of operations and limit its growth; 

· loss of or significant restrictions on the use of particular types of underwriting criteria, such as credit scoring, or other data or methodologies, in the pricing and underwriting of the Company’s products could reduce the Company’s future profitability; 

· acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other unintended consequences;

· the Company’s businesses may be adversely affected if it is unable to hire and retain qualified employees; 

· intellectual property is important to the Company’s business, and the Company may be unable to protect and enforce its own intellectual property or the Company may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property of others; 

· changes in federal regulation could impose significant burdens on the Company and otherwise adversely impact the Company’s results; 

· changes to existing U.S. accounting standards may adversely impact the Company’s reported results; 

· changes in U.S. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which the Company operates could adversely impact the Company; and 

· the Company’s share repurchase plans depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the Company’s desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the Company’s qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company’s operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions and other factors.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 16, 2017, as updated by our periodic filings with the SEC.

GLOSSARY OF FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES 

The following measures are used by the Company’s management to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated financial statements or are not required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements or, in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures also follow. 

In the opinion of the Company’s management, a discussion of these measures provides investors, financial analysts, rating agencies and other financial statement users with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company’s periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company’s financial performance. Internally, the Company’s management uses these measures to evaluate performance against historical results, to establish financial targets on a consolidated basis and for other reasons, which are discussed below. 

Some of these measures exclude net realized investment gains (losses), net of tax, and/or net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity, which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. 

Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and, therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by the Company’s management. 

RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO CORE INCOME AND CERTAIN OTHER NON-GAAP MEASURES 

Core income (loss) is consolidated net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses), discontinued operations, the effect of a change in tax laws and tax rates at enactment date, and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles when applicable. Segment income (loss) is determined in the same manner as core income (loss) on a segment basis. Management uses segment income (loss) to analyze each segment’s performance and as a tool in making business decisions. Financial statement users also consider core income when analyzing the results and trends of insurance companies. Core income (loss) per share is core income (loss) on a per common share basis.

Return on equity is the ratio of annualized net income less preferred dividends to average shareholders’ equity for the periods presented. Core return on equity is the ratio of annualized core income less preferred dividends to adjusted average shareholders’ equity for the periods presented. In the opinion of the Company’s management, these are important indicators of how well management creates value for its shareholders through its operating activities and its capital management. 

Average shareholders’ equity is (a) the sum of total shareholders’ equity excluding preferred stock at the beginning and end of each of the quarters for the period presented divided by (b) the number of quarters in the period presented times two. 

Adjusted average shareholders’ equity is (a) the sum of adjusted shareholders’ equity at the beginning and end of each of the quarters for the period presented divided by (b) the number of quarters in the period presented times two.

RECONCILIATION OF PRE-TAX UNDERWRITING GAIN EXCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMS TO NET INCOME 

Underwriting gain/(loss) is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses. In the opinion of the Company’s management, it is important to measure the profitability of each segment excluding the results of investing activities, which are managed separately from the insurance business. This measure is used to assess each segment’s business performance and as a tool in making business decisions. Pre-tax underwriting gain, excluding the impact of catastrophes and net favorable prior year loss reserve development, is the underwriting gain adjusted to exclude claims and claim adjustment expenses, reinstatement premiums and assessments related to catastrophes and loss reserve development related to time periods prior to the current year. In the opinion of the Company’s management, this measure is meaningful to users of the financial statements to understand the Company’s periodic earnings and the variability of earnings caused by the unpredictable nature (i.e., the timing and amount) of catastrophes and loss reserve development. This measure is also referred to as underlying underwriting margin or underlying underwriting gain. 

A catastrophe is a severe loss designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from catastrophic events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for events in the United States and Canada. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally occurring events, such as solar flares. Catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks and other intentionally destructive acts including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events, cyber attacks, explosions and infrastructure failures. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount. Their effects are included in net and core income and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves upon occurrence. A catastrophe may result in the payment of reinsurance reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools. 

The Company’s threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is exceeded and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. Additionally, an aggregate threshold is applied for international business across all reportable segments. The threshold for 2017 ranged from approximately $17 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes. 

Net favorable (unfavorable) prior year loss reserve development is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims, which may be related to one or more prior years. In the opinion of the Company’s management, a discussion of loss reserve development is meaningful to users of the financial statements as it allows them to assess the impact between prior and current year development on incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses, net and core income (loss), and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.

COMBINED RATIO AND ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNDERLYING COMBINED RATIO 

Combined ratio: For Statutory Accounting Practices (SAP), the combined ratio is the sum of the SAP loss and LAE ratio and the SAP underwriting expense ratio as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. The combined ratio as used in this earnings release is the equivalent of, and is calculated in the same manner as, the SAP combined ratio except that the SAP underwriting expense ratio is based on net written premiums and the underwriting expense ratio as used in this earnings release is based on net earned premiums. 

For SAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses less certain administrative services fee income to net earned premiums as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. The loss and LAE ratio as used in this earnings release is calculated in the same manner as the SAP ratio. 

For SAP, the underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred (including commissions paid), less certain administrative services fee income and billing and policy fees, to net written premiums as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. The underwriting expense ratio as used in this earnings release, is the ratio of underwriting expenses (including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs), less certain administrative services fee income, billing and policy fees and other, to net earned premiums. 

The combined ratio, loss and LAE ratio, and underwriting expense ratio are used as indicators of the Company’s underwriting discipline, efficiency in acquiring and servicing its business and overall underwriting profitability. A combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss. 

Underlying combined ratio represents the combined ratio excluding the impact of net prior year reserve development and catastrophes. The underlying combined ratio is an indicator of the Company’s underwriting discipline and underwriting profitability for the current accident year. 

Other companies’ method of computing similarly titled measures may not be comparable to the Company’s method of computing these ratios.

Calculation of the Combined Ratio 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) For purposes of computing ratios, billing and policy fees and other (which are a component of other revenues) are allocated as a reduction of underwriting expenses. In addition, fee income is allocated as a reduction of losses and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. In addition, G&A include non-insurance expenses that are excluded from underwriting expenses, and accordingly are excluded in calculating the combined ratio. 

RECONCILIATION OF BOOK VALUE PER SHARE AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY TO CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURES 

Book value per share is total common shareholders’ equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Adjusted book value per share is total common shareholders’ equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses, net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity, divided by the number of common shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company’s management, adjusted book value per share is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company’s book value per share as it removes the effect of changing prices on invested assets (i.e., net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax), which do not have an equivalent impact on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. Tangible book value per share is adjusted book value per share excluding the after-tax value of goodwill and other intangible assets divided by the number of common shares outstanding. In the opinion of the Company’s management, tangible book value per share is useful in an analysis of a property casualty company’s book value on a nominal basis as it removes certain effects of purchase accounting (i.e., goodwill and other intangible assets), in addition to the effect of changing prices on invested assets.

RECONCILIATION OF TOTAL CAPITALIZATION TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION EXCLUDING NET UNREALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS, NET OF TAX 

Total capitalization is the sum of total shareholders’ equity and debt. Debt-to-capital ratio excluding net unrealized gain on investments, net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity, is the ratio of debt to total capitalization excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses included in shareholders’ equity. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the debt-to-capital ratio is useful in an analysis of the Company’s financial leverage.

OTHER DEFINITIONS 

Gross written premiums reflect the direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to policyholders for the effective period of the contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract. Net written premiums reflect gross written premiums less premiums ceded to reinsurers. 

For Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance, retention is the amount of premium available for renewal that was retained, excluding rate and exposure changes. For Personal Insurance, retention is the ratio of the expected number of renewal policies that will be retained throughout the annual policy period to the number of available renewal base policies. For all of the segments, renewal rate change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, excluding exposure changes. Exposure is the measure of risk used in the pricing of an insurance product. The change in exposure is the amount of change in premium on policies that renew attributable to the change in portfolio risk. Renewal premium change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, including rate and exposure changes. New business is the amount of written premium related to new policyholders and additional products sold to existing policyholders. These are operating statistics, which are in part dependent on the use of estimates and are therefore subject to change. For Business Insurance, retention, renewal premium change and new business exclude National Accounts and surety. For Bond & Specialty Insurance, retention, renewal premium change and new business exclude surety. 

Statutory capital and surplus represents the excess of an insurance company’s admitted assets over its liabilities, including loss reserves, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. 

Holding company liquidity is the total funds available at the holding company level to fund general corporate purposes, primarily the payment of shareholder dividends and debt service. These funds consist of total cash, short-term invested assets and other readily marketable securities held by the holding company.
