Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

Quarterly Results Press Release

On Tuesday, February 6, 2018, a press release was issued regarding the first quarter 2018 results of Emerson Electric Co. (the “Company”). A copy of this press release is furnished with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.

References to underlying orders in the press release refer to the Company's trailing three-month average orders growth versus the prior year, excluding currency, acquisitions and divestitures.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The press release contains non-GAAP financial measures as such term is defined in Regulation G under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. While the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The reasons management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information are set forth in the Company’s most recent Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

Given the complexities associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), the ultimate effects on repatriation cost and other tax items may differ materially from the provisional amounts presented herein due to additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and further evaluation of the Company’s actions, assumptions and interpretations.

Statements in this press release that are not strictly historical may be “forward-looking” statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, and Emerson undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect later developments. These risks and uncertainties include economic and currency conditions, market demand, pricing, protection of intellectual property, and competitive and technological factors, among others, as set forth in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC, as well as the impact of the Tax Act as described above.
