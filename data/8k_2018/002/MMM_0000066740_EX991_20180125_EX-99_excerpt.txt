“3M’s fourth quarter was marked by record sales, expanded margins and robust organic growth across all business groups and geographic areas,” said Inge G. Thulin, 3M chairman, president and chief executive officer. “Our team’s performance capped a successful year for our enterprise. For 2017, we posted organic growth of 5 percent, along with healthy earnings, cash flow and return on invested capital. 

“Over the last several years, we have accelerated investments in the business — including stepping up research and development and our commercialization efforts — which is evident in our strong results,” Thulin continued. “Going into 2018, we will increase investments further, and are positioned to continue generating premium value for our customers and premium returns for our shareholders.” 

Fourth-Quarter Results 

Fourth-quarter GAAP earnings were $0.85 per share, a decrease of 55 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2016.

Excluding this expense, earnings were $2.10 per share, an increase of 11.7 percent year-on-year, as referenced in the “Supplemental Financial Information Non-GAAP Measures” section. 

Sales were up 9.0 percent to $8.0 billion. Organic local-currency sales increased 6.0 percent while acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 0.3 percent.

The company’s operating cash flow was $1.9 billion, contributing to conversion of 268 percent of net income to free cash flow, as referenced in the “Supplemental Financial Information Non-GAAP Measures” section. This result included a $600 million contribution to the company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan in the fourth quarter following the signing of the TCJA. The net impact of the TCJA and pension contribution positively impacted free cash flow conversion by 112 percentage points.

(a) Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they function as useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(b) Net debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy.

(c) Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation.

(d) During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3M’s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA’s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. This provisional amount is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the net impact of enactment of the TCJA. This item represents a significant charge that impacted the Company’s financial results. Income, earnings per share, and the effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing the Company’s operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for this item is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends. The determination of this item may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

(Dollars in millions) 

(Unaudited) 

Effective in the first quarter of 2017, as part of 3M’s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers the Company made the following changes: 

1. Integrated the former Renewable Energy Division into existing divisions; 

2. Combined two divisions to form the Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division; and 

3. Consolidated U.S. customer account activity - impacting dual credit reporting 

Integration of former Renewable Energy Division 

· The (i) solar and wind and (ii) energy product lines (along with certain technology previously included in Corporate and Unallocated) of the former Renewable Energy Division (RED) were integrated into the existing Electrical Markets Division and Electronics Materials Solutions Division, respectively, within the Electronics and Energy business segment. In addition, the former RED’s window film products were moved into the Commercial Solutions Division within the Safety and Graphics business segment. This change resulted in a decrease in previously reported net sales and operating income for total year 2016 of $203 million and $38 million, respectively, in the Electronics and Energy segment. These decreases were offset by a $207 million and $29 million increase in previously reported total year 2016 net sales and operating income, respectively, in the Safety and Graphics business segment, and a $4 million decrease and $9 million increase in previously reported net sales and operating income, respectively, in Corporate and Unallocated. 

Creation of Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division 

· The former Automotive Division and Aerospace and Commercial Transportation Division (both within the Industrial business segment) were combined to create the Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division. Because this realignment was within the Industrial business segment, it had no impact on business segment reporting. 

Consolidation of U.S. customer account activity - impacting dual credit reporting 

· The Company consolidated its customer account activity in the U.S. into more centralized sales districts to better serve customers. As discussed further below, 3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain U.S. sales and related operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides customer account activity (“sales district”) with respect to a particular product sold in the U.S. Previously, a customer in the U.S. may have been aligned to several sales districts associated with multiple divisions or segments based on the individual products the customer purchased across 3M’s portfolio. The alignment of U.S. customer accounts to fewer, more focused sales districts therefore changed the attribution of dual credit across 3M’s business segments. As a result, previously reported aggregate business segment net sales and operating income for total year 2016 increased $163 million and $36 million, respectively, offset by similar increases in the elimination of dual credit net sales and operating income amounts. 

The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of the preceding business segment reporting changes for all periods presented. Refer to 3M’s Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on March 9, 2017, for additional supplemental unaudited historical business segment net sales and operating income information. In addition, these business segment changes were reflected in 3M’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 4, 2017, (which updated 3M’s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K) and 3M’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, and Sept. 30, 2017.
