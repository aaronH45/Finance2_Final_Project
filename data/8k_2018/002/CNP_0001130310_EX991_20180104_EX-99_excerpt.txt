CenterPoint Energy 2017 earnings expected to increase as a result of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  

Houston – Jan. 4, 2018 – CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (NYSE: CNP) today announced expected earnings on a guidance basis for 2017 will incorporate a re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities and a credit to income tax expense. As a result, earnings are expected to exceed the previously provided $1.25 to $1.33 guidance range. Absent these adjustments, earnings are anticipated to be at or near the high end of the $1.25 to $1.33 range.  

CenterPoint Energy’s management will host an earnings call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday, Feb. 22, 2018, and will provide dial-in instructions at a later date. Company executives plan to discuss 2017 earnings results, 2018 earnings guidance, long-term growth drivers, and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  

Earnings Guidance Variables and Assumptions  

Guidance for 2017 considers utility operations performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, anticipated effective tax rates, and financing activities. In providing this guidance, the company uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share that does not consider other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings or losses from the change in the value of the ZENS securities and the related stocks, or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company’s Energy Services business.  

In providing guidance, the company assumes for midstream investments a limited partner ownership interest in Enable Midstream averaging 54.1% for 2017 and includes the amortization of CenterPoint Energy’s basis difference in Enable Midstream. CenterPoint Energy’s guidance takes into account such factors as Enable Midstream’s most recent public outlook for 2017 provided on Nov. 1, 2017, and anticipated effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts such as any changes in accounting standards or Enable Midstream’s unusual items.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

CenterPoint Energy provides guidance based on adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. CenterPoint Energy’s adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation excludes from diluted earnings per share the impact of ZENS and related securities and mark-to-market gains or losses resulting from the company’s Energy Services business. CenterPoint Energy is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward looking or 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share because changes in the value of ZENS and related securities and mark-to-market gains or losses resulting from the company’s Energy Services business are not estimable.  

Management evaluates the company’s financial performance in part based on adjusted diluted earnings per share. We believe that presenting this non-GAAP financial measure enhances an investor’s understanding of CenterPoint Energy’s overall financial performance by providing them with an additional meaningful and relevant comparison of current and anticipated future results across periods. The adjustments made in this non-GAAP financial measure exclude items that Management believes do not most accurately reflect the company’s fundamental business performance. CenterPoint Energy’s adjusted diluted earnings per share non-GAAP financial measure should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, diluted earnings per share, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure also may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
