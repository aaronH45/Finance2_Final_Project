Outlook 

For 2018, the Company is establishing its initial EPS guidance at a range of $3.10 to $3.50 per diluted share. Guidance for 2018 assumes an increase in oil and gas, mining and infrastructure opportunities, and reflects the new revenue recognition standard and our current interpretation of recently enacted tax reform legislation in the United States. Based on our current interpretation and analysis, we expect the benefit of the new revenue recognition standard and U.S. tax reform will be approximately $0.75 to $0.95 per diluted share, a majority of which can be attributed to the new revenue recognition standard.

Fluor’s Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment reported segment profit of $455 million, compared to a segment profit of $401 million in 2016. Results for the year include a $44 million revision related to estimated cost increases on a downstream project.

In the fourth quarter, the segment booked new awards of $1.1 billion, including an offshore project in the North Sea. Ending backlog was $17.0 billion compared to $21.8 billion a year ago. 

The Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment reported segment loss of $171 million, compared to segment profit of $136 million in 2016.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This press release contains a discussion of consolidated segment profit that would be deemed a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC rules. Segment profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests excluding: corporate general and administrative expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; and other non-operating income and expense items. The company believes that consolidated segment profit provides a meaningful perspective on its business results as it is the aggregation of individual segment profit measures that the company utilizes to evaluate and manage its business performance. A reconciliation of this measure to earnings (loss) before taxes is included in the press release tables. In addition, this press release contains a discussion of earnings and diluted earnings per share, excluding the effects of recently enacted tax reform legislation, that would be deemed non-GAAP financial measures. The company believes the exclusion of the tax impact allows investors to evaluate the company’s ongoing earnings and to make meaningful period-over-period comparisons.
