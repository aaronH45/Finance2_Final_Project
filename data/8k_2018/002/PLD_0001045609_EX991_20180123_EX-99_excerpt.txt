The difference between Core FFO and Net Earnings predominately relates to real estate depreciation and gains on real estate transactions. See the Notes and Definitions for more information. Net promote guidance is $0.05 to $0.07 per share. Earnings guidance includes potential future gains recognized from real estate transactions, but excludes future foreign currency or derivative gains or losses as these items are difficult to predict. As disclosed in the Press Release dated January 17, 2018, same store guidance is based on the new definition. Guidance Highlights 5

 Values represent the entire venture at 100%, not Prologis proportionate share. Values are presented at Prologis’ adjusted basis derived from the ventures’ U.S. GAAP information and may not be comparable to values reflected in the ventures’ stand alone financial statements calculated on a different basis. Throughout this document we use the most recent public information for these co-investment ventures. Effective October 1, 2017, the assets of Prologis Targeted Europe Logistics Fund were contributed to Prologis European Properties Fund II, in exchange for units and the assumption of debt. At the same time Prologis European Properties Fund II was renamed to Prologis European Logistics Fund. We exchanged our investment in Prologis Targeted European Logisitics Fund for an equity investment in Prologis European Logistics Fund, which resulted in our investment being economically similar to our investment in the previous ventures.
