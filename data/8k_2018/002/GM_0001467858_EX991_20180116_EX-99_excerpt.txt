INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THIS PRESENTATION Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements: This presentation and related comments by management may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations about possible future events and thus are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ materially from forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including: (1) our ability to deliver new products, services and experiences that attract new, and are desired by existing, customers and to effectively compete in autonomous, ride-sharing and transportation as a service; (2) sales of full-size pick-up trucks and SUVs, which may be affected by increases in the price of oil; (3) the volatility of global sales and operations; (4) aggressive competition, including the impact of new market entrants; (5) changes in, or the introduction of novel interpretations of, laws, regulations or policies particularly those relating to free trade agreements, tax rates and vehicle safety and any government actions that may affect the production, licensing, distribution, pricing, or selling of our products; (6) our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control; (7) compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our industry, including those regarding fuel economy and emissions; (8) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations; (9) compliance with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement; (10) our ability to maintain quality control over our vehicles and avoid recalls and the cost and effect on our reputation and products; (11) the ability of suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and on schedule; (12) our dependence on our manufacturing facilities; (13) our ability to realize production efficiencies and cost reductions; (14) our ability to successfully and cost-efficiently restructure operations in various countries with minimal disruption; (15) our ability to manage risks related to security breaches and other disruptions to vehicles, information technology networks and systems; (16) our ability to develop captive financing capability through GM Financial; (17) significant increases in pension expense or projected pension contributions; (18) significant changes in the economic, political, and regulatory environment, market conditions, and foreign currency exchange rates. A further list and description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. GM cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. GM undertakes no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements. Basis of Presentation: On March 5, 2017 we entered into a Master Agreement to sell our European Business (as defined herein) to PSA Group for net consideration with an estimated value of approximately $2.5 billion. On July 31, 2017, we closed the sale of our Opel/Vauxhall business and certain other assets in Europe (the “Opel/Vauxhall Business”); and on October 31, 2017, we completed the transfer of GM Financial's European financing subsidiaries and branches (together with the Opel/Vauxhall Business, our “European Business”). Accordingly, the financial and operational information included in this presentation is presented on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise indicated. For additional information regarding the sale of our European Business to PSA Group, see Note 2 in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2017 (the “10-Q”) and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview-PSA Group Transaction” in the 10-Q.  

USE OF NON - GAAP F INANCIAL MEASURES Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Unless otherwise indicated, our non-GAAP measures discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchanged Commission and this presentation are related to our continuing operations and not our discontinued operations nor assets and liabilities held for sale. Our non-GAAP measures include earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)-adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests, earnings per share (EPS)-diluted- adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow. Our calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve ROIC-adjusted. Management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. Further, our Board of Directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. For these reasons we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful for our investors.
