[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

SECAUCUS, N.J., February 1, 2018 - Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services, announced today financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.

“We delivered a strong fourth quarter, which included 4% revenue growth and 7% adjusted EPS growth," said Steve Rusckowski, Chairman, CEO and President. "In 2017 we made great progress accelerating growth and driving operational excellence. We announced seven acquisitions and exited the year exceeding our $1.3 billion goal of cumulative run rate Invigorate savings. 

"In 2018 our guidance for the full year is aligned with our long term outlook even before the meaningful benefit of tax reform. We expect to deliver continued acceleration of top-line growth of 4-5% and more than 20% adjusted earnings growth, driven in part by solid mid to high single digit earnings growth from operations." 

Mr. Rusckowski continued, "Quest is a beneficiary of recent tax legislation, which enables us to further grow earnings per share and invest in our business and our people. The benefits of tax reform will also help offset new Medicare reimbursement reductions under PAMA, which represent a headwind to our company and industry."

In 2018 the company expects to realize approximately $180 million in tax savings on an adjusted basis. Of this amount, the company plans to reinvest roughly $75 million before tax back into the business and its employees, resulting in a benefit of approximately $120 million to net earnings. Investment initiatives include: 

•Advanced diagnostics innovation through new tests and high-touch concierge services;

•Investments to deliver a consistently excellent consumer experience both online through the MyQuest mobile patient application and patient service centers; and 

•A bonus of up to $500 for nearly 40,000 employees to be paid based on the company’s performance in 2018. 

Guidance for Full Year 2018

Beginning in 2018, the company will change how it presents adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense to additionally exclude ETB. The company believes this presentation provides investors with additional insight into the company's operational performance as well as the impact of TCJA. As a result, the company's presentation of 2018 adjusted diluted EPS guidance described below excludes the impact of special items, amortization expense and ETB. For the full year 2017, adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense and ETB was $5.40. 

The company estimates full year 2018 results as follows:

Non-GAAP adjusted measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to GAAP results. Non-GAAP adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under GAAP. Management may use these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and analysts to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, as well as to analyze the underlying trends in our business and to assess our performance.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, primarily represents non-cash asset impairment charges associated with an investment, non-cash asset impairment charges and incremental costs incurred as a result of hurricanes and costs incurred related to certain legal matters, partially offset by gain on the sale of an interest in an equity method investee. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily represents non-cash asset impairment charges. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, primarily represents a gain on escrow recovery associated with an acquisition, partially offset by costs associated with winding down subsidiaries, non-cash asset impairment charges and costs incurred related to certain legal matters. The following table summarizes the pre-tax impact of these other items on the company's consolidated statement of operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(d)For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, represents charges associated with the March 2016 cash tender offer where the company purchased $200 million of its 6.95% Senior Notes due July 2037 and 5.75% Senior Notes due January 2040. The pre-tax charges associated with the retirement of debt and related refinancing charges are recorded in other income (expense), net on the company's consolidated statement of operations. 

(e)For gain on disposition of business, income tax expense resulted in a combined tax rate of 71.4%, which was significantly in excess of the statutory rate primarily due to a lower tax basis in the assets sold, specifically the goodwill associated with the disposition. For the retirement of debt and related refinancing charges, income tax benefits were calculated such that the combined tax rate was 38.9% for 2016. For the restructuring and integration charges and other items, income tax impacts, where recorded, were primarily calculated using combined tax rates of 38.7% for both 2017 and 2016. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, other items also includes the impact of recording a valuation allowance against certain net operating loss carryforwards in a geography impacted by hurricanes. The following table summarizes the income tax (benefit) expense associated with the special items:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) - For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, certain income tax benefits represents the net tax benefit associated with the TCJA. The company recorded an estimated net income tax benefit of $106 million associated with the TCJA, including a deferred income tax benefit of $115 million primarily due to the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities and reserves at the new combined tax rate of 25.5%, partially offset by $9 million of current tax expense primarily due to the mandatory repatriation toll charge on undistributed foreign earnings and profits.

(f)Represents the impact of amortization expense on diluted earnings per common share, net of the income tax benefit. The income tax benefit was primarily calculated using a combined tax rate of 38.7% for both 2017 and 2016. The pre-tax amortization expense that is excluded from the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense is recorded in the company's statements of operations as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

3)Other operating expense (income), net includes miscellaneous income and expense items related to operating activities. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, other operating expense (income), net principally consists of non-cash asset impairment charges. Other operating expense (income), net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, principally consists of a gain on an escrow recovery associated with an acquisition, partially offset by non-cash asset impairment charges. 

4)Other income (expense), net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to non-operating activities, such as gains and losses associated with investments, other non-operating assets and early retirement of debt. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, other income (expense), net includes a $7 million gain on the sale of an interest in an equity method investment, which is partially offset by non-cash asset impairment charges associated with certain investments of $6 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, other income (expense), net includes $48 million of charges on the retirement of debt associated with the March 2016 cash tender offer and non-cash asset impairment charges associated with certain investments of $7 million.

6)For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operations benefited from a $62 million decrease in 2017 tax payments associated with the realization of a deferred tax benefit and improved operating performance. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operations included $91 million of income taxes paid associated with the 

11

sale of Focus Diagnostics products and $47 million of pre-tax cash charges, or $30 million after the related cash tax benefit, related to the retirement of debt, which were partially offset by $54 million of proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swap agreements.

7)The outlook for adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense and ETB represents management’s estimates for the full year 2018 before the impact of special items, amortization expense and ETB. Further impacts to earnings related to special items may be incurred throughout 2018. Additionally, the amount of ETB is dependent upon employee exercise behavior and the company's stock price, which are difficult to predict. The following table reconciles our 2018 outlook for adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense and ETB to the corresponding amount determined under GAAP:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Represents estimated full year pre-tax charges of $110 million primarily associated with systems conversions, integration and workforce reductions incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business. Income tax benefits were calculated using a combined tax rate of 25.5%. 

(b)Represents the estimated impact of amortization expense for 2018 on the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense. Amortization expense used in the calculation is as follows (dollars in millions):
