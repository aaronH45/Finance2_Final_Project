On February 26, 2018, Scott M. Prochazka, President and Chief Executive Officer of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (“CenterPoint Energy”), amended an existing pre-arranged trading plan (the “Amended Plan”), which was initially adopted in March 2017 to sell a limited amount of shares of CenterPoint Energy common stock over an extended period of time for personal financial management purposes. The Amended Plan provides for an increase in the amount of shares of CenterPoint Energy common stock that may be sold under the Amended Plan.

Rule 10b5-1 permits the adoption of a written plan for selling stock at times when insiders are not in possession of material nonpublic information, and allows them to sell stock on a regular basis and in a non-discretionary manner, regardless of any subsequent material nonpublic information they receive after adoption of the plan.
