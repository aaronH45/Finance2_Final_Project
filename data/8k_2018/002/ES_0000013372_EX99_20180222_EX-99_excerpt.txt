Eversource Energy Reports Full Year 2017 Results 

HARTFORD, Conn. and BOSTON, Mass. (Feb. 22, 2018) – Eversource Energy (NYSE: ES)  

today reported full-year 2017 earnings of $988 million, or $3.11 per share, compared with 2016 earnings of $942.3 million, or $2.96 per share.  

In the fourth quarter of 2017, Eversource Energy earned $237.4 million, or $0.75 per share, compared with earnings of $229.2 million, or $0.72 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.  

“We were pleased with our 2017 performance, a year our customers received industry leading levels of reliable service, our employees achieved record safety performance, and our investors experienced very solid increases in dividends and earnings,” said Jim Judge, Eversource Energy chairman, president and chief executive officer.  

2018 and Long-Term Earnings Per Share (EPS) Guidance 

Also today, Eversource Energy projected 2018 earnings of between $3.20 per share and $3.30 per share and long-term EPS growth through 2021 of between 5 percent and 7 percent on average, using 2017 earnings of $3.11 per share as the base.  

Electric Distribution and Generation 

Eversource Energy’s electric distribution and generation segment earned $497.4 million for the full year of 2017, compared with earnings of $462.8 million for the full year of 2016. The segment earned $104 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with earnings of $81.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Improved fourth quarter and full year results were due primarily to a lower effective tax rate in 2017 and lower non-tracked operations and maintenance expense in 2017, partially offset by higher depreciation and property tax expense.  

Electric Transmission 

Eversource Energy’s transmission segment earned $391.9 million for the full year 2017, compared with earnings of $370.8 million for the full year of 2016. It earned $102.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with earnings of $104.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Higher full-year earnings were due primarily to an increased level of investment in Eversource Energy transmission facilities. Lower fourth quarter results in 2017 reflect the impact of a benefit recorded in 2016 related to the recovery of $27.5 million of pre-tax merger-related costs through electric transmission rates. 

Natural Gas Distribution 

Eversource Energy’s natural gas distribution segment earned $74.6 million for the full year of 2017, compared with earnings of $77.7 million for the full year of 2016. Fourth quarter natural gas segment  

earnings were $25.5 million in 2017, compared with $25.8 million in 2016. Lower results in 2017 were driven primarily by higher depreciation, operation and maintenance, and property tax expense, partially offset by higher revenues resulting from colder fourth quarter weather in 2017. Firm natural gas sales rose 3 percent in 2017, compared with 2016. 

Eversource Energy Parent and Other Companies 

Eversource Energy parent and other companies earned $24.1 million for the full year of 2017, compared with $31 million for the full year of 2016. It earned $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $17.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Lower fourth quarter results were due primarily to a higher effective tax rate in 2017.

1 All per-share amounts in this news release are reported on a diluted basis. The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Eversource Energy. The earnings and EPS of each business do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such business, but rather represent a direct interest in Eversource Energy's assets and liabilities, as a whole. EPS by business is a non-GAAP (not determined using generally accepted accounting principles) measure that is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to controlling interests of each business by the weighted average diluted Eversource parent common shares outstanding for the period. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate earnings results, provide details of earnings results by business, and more fully compare and explain our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 and 2016 results. Management believes that this measurement is useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of Eversource Energy’s businesses. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to Eversource Energy’s consolidated net income attributable to controlling interests or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of Eversource Energy’s operating performance.
