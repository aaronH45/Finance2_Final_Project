Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

On January 24, 2018, Prologis, Inc.’s (the “Company”) operating partnership Prologis, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) priced an offering of €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Notes due 2020 (the “Notes”). In connection with the offering, the Company and the Operating Partnership entered into an Underwriting Agreement, dated January 24, 2018 (the “Underwriting Agreement”), with Merrill Lynch International as the underwriter (the “Underwriter”), pursuant to which the Operating Partnership agreed to sell and the Underwriter agreed to purchase the Notes, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth therein. A copy of the Underwriting Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to this Current Report and is incorporated herein by reference.  

The Notes are being issued under an indenture, dated as of June 8, 2011 (the “Base Indenture”), among the Company, the Operating Partnership and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, dated as of June 8, 2011, the second supplemental indenture, dated as of June 8, 2011, the third supplemental indenture, dated as of June 8, 2011, the fourth supplemental indenture, dated as of June 8, 2011, the fifth supplemental indenture, dated as of August 15, 2013, the sixth supplemental indenture, dated as of December 3, 2013, the seventh supplemental indenture, dated as of February 20, 2014, and the eighth supplemental indenture, dated as of June 7, 2017 (the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth supplemental indentures, the “Indenture”).  

The issuance and sale of the Notes is expected to close on January 29, 2018. The net proceeds to the Operating Partnership from the sale of the Notes, after the Underwriter’s discount and offering expenses, are estimated to be approximately €401 million, or $490 million, based on the euro/U.S. dollar rate of exchange as of January 19, 2018. The Operating Partnership intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to repay or repurchase other indebtedness. In the short term, the Operating Partnership intends to use the net proceeds to repay borrowings under its multi-currency senior term loan.  

The per annum interest rate on the Notes will be reset quarterly based on the three-month EURIBOR plus 25 basis points and mature on January 29, 2020. Interest on the Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on January 29, April 29, July 29 and October 29 of each year, beginning on April 29, 2018. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.  

The Notes will be redeemable in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, on or after December 29, 2019 at the option of the Operating Partnership, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the principal amount being redeemed to, but excluding, the redemption date.  

The Indenture governing the Notes restricts, among other things, the Operating Partnership’s ability to incur additional indebtedness and to merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of substantially all of its assets.  

The Notes are being issued pursuant to the Registration Statement (File No. 333-216491) that the Company and the Operating Partnership filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) relating to the public offering from time to time of securities of the Company and the Operating Partnership pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with filing with the SEC a definitive prospectus supplement, dated January 24, 2018, and base prospectus, dated March 7, 2017, relating to the public offering of the Notes and corresponding guarantees, the Company and the Operating Partnership are filing the Underwriting Agreement, the form of the Officers’ Certificate related to the Notes, the form of the Notes and certain other exhibits with this Current Report of Form 8-K as an exhibit to such Registration Statement. See “Item 9.01 – Financial Statements and Exhibits.”  

This Current Report does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
