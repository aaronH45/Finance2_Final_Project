2026 Notes Indenture and 2024 Convertible Notes Indenture  

On February 13, 2018, Western Digital Corporation (“Western Digital”) announced that it closed its previously announced offerings of $2.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.750% senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due 2024 (the “2024 Convertible Notes,” and together with the 2026 Notes, the “Notes”).  

The 2026 Notes were issued pursuant to the indenture attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, dated as of February 13, 2018 (the “2026 Notes Indenture”) among (i) Western Digital, (ii) HGST, Inc., WD Media, LLC, Western Digital (Fremont), LLC and Western Digital Technologies, Inc. (together, the “WD Guarantors”) and (iii) U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”).  

The 2024 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to the indenture attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2, dated as of February 13, 2018 (the “2024 Convertible Notes Indenture” and together with the “2026 Notes Indenture”, the “Indentures”) among Western Digital, the WD Guarantors and the Trustee.  

The Indentures contain certain restrictive covenants that limit Western Digital and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets; create liens; and incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness. These covenants are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions. The Indentures also contain customary events of default.  

The above description of the Indentures is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the 2026 Notes Indenture and 2024 Convertible Notes Indenture, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
