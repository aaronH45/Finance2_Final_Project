Item 5.02.  

Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers  

On January 11, 2018, the Prologis, Inc. 2018 Outperformance Plan (“POP”) was executed, replacing the Prologis, Inc. 2016 Outperformance Plan (the “2016 Plan”). POP amends and restates the 2016 Plan to (1) constrain the maximum size of the overall performance pool to a fixed amount, (2) reduce the size of the initial payout of awards at the end of the performance period, (3) require additional long-term vesting for the bulk of the awards and (4) simplify the overall plan structure.  

These changes, among other things, replace the variable maximum cap on the performance pool as set forth in the 2016 Plan with an absolute maximum cap ($100 million for the 2018-2019 performance period). POP also reduces the initial award amounts to be paid at the end of the three-year performance vesting period from up to $75 million of the aggregate award pool (as was the case in the 2016 Plan), to 20% of the aggregate earned awards (the “Initial Payout Amount”). Additionally, the plan changes impose additional seven-year cliff vesting on 80% of the aggregate earned awards. These changes replaced the requirements for “Excess Amounts” as defined in the 2016 Plan.  

Generally, under POP, in the event that our annualized total stockholder return (“TSR”) during the performance period exceeds the annualized TSR of the Morgan Stanley Capital Index US REIT Index (“RMS”) by more than 100 basis points during the performance period, then a performance pool will be formed under POP equal to 3% of such excess return to stockholders. This performance hurdle did not change from the 2016 Plan.  

Generally, participants will not be able to sell or transfer any equity they receive as Initial Payout Amounts until three years after the end of the three-year performance period. If the performance criteria is not met, any POP participation points and POP LTIP Units of Prologis, L.P. for the applicable performance period will be forfeited. As with the 2016 Plan, POP also has certain positive TSR requirements, which must be met before participants can be paid awards under POP. 

POP has been included herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
