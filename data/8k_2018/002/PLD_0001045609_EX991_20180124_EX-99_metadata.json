        "The TCJA makes significant changes to the taxation of international businesses, which may affect us and how we are taxed on income earned by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. These changes may cause us to recognize additional income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In some cases it is not currently clear whether such income will be qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income tests applicable to REITs. Consequently, the recognition of such income could affect Prologis Inc.’s ability to qualify as a REIT and may require certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be restructured in order to maintain Prologis, Inc.’s REIT qualification."
