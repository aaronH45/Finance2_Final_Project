[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Under U.S. GAAP, the accounting for a net loss from continuing operations results in the presentation of dilutive earnings per share equal to basic earnings per share, as any increase in basic shares would be anti-dilutive to earnings per share. As a result of the highlighted items identified during Q4 2017, the Company reported a net loss from continuing operations within our GAAP Consolidated Statement of Operations, while reporting income on a non-GAAP basis. An adjustment is shown to reflect the dilution of 7.2 million dilutive shares outstanding in Q4 2017.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

In addition to the GAAP results included in this presentation, Motorola Solutions also has included non-GAAP measurements of results. The company has provided these non-GAAP measurements to help investors better understand its core operating performance, enhance comparisons of core operating performance from period to period and allow better comparisons of operating performance to its competitors. Among other things, management uses these operating results, excluding the identified items, to evaluate performance of the businesses and to evaluate results relative to certain incentive compensation targets. Management uses operating results excluding these items because it believes this measurement enables it to make better period-to-period evaluations of the financial performance of core business operations. The non-GAAP measurements are intended only as a supplement to the comparable GAAP measurements and the company compensates for the limitations inherent in the use of non-GAAP measurements by using GAAP measures in conjunction with the non-GAAP measurements. As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measurements in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Organic Revenue: Reflects net sales calculated under GAAP excluding net sales from acquired business owned for less than four full quarters. Management believes organic revenue helps it and investors better identify the underlying trends of established and ongoing operations by excluding the effects of acquisitions which can obscure period to period comparisons.

Highlighted items: The company has excluded the effects of highlighted items including, but not limited to, acquisition-related transaction costs, tangible and intangible asset impairments, restructuring charges, non-cash pension adjustments, significant litigation and other contingencies, significant gains and losses on investments, and the income tax effects of significant tax matters, including recently enacted tax reform legislation, from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements because the company believes that these historical items do not reflect expected future operating earnings or expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's current operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. For the purposes of management's internal analysis over operating performance, the company uses financial statements that exclude highlighted items, as these charges do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's current operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance.

Share-based compensation expense: The company has excluded share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements. Although share-based compensation is a key incentive offered to the company’s employees and the company believes such compensation contributed to the revenue earned during the periods presented and also believes it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, the company continues to evaluate its performance excluding share-based compensation expense primarily because it represents a significant non-cash expense. Share-based compensation expense will recur in future periods.

Intangible assets amortization expense: The company has excluded intangible assets amortization expense from its Non-GAAP operating expenses and net earnings measurements, primarily because it represents a non-cash expense and because the company evaluates its performance excluding intangible assets amortization expense. Amortization of intangible assets is consistent in amount and frequency but is significantly affected by the timing and size of the company’s acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to the company’s revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to the company’s future period revenues as well. Intangible assets amortization expense will recur in future periods.

Details of the above items and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measurements to the corresponding GAAP measurements can be found at the end of this press release.

Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Under U.S. GAAP, the accounting for a net loss from continuing operations results in the presentation of dilutive earnings per share equal to basic earnings per share, as any increase in basic shares would be anti-dilutive to earnings per share. As a result of the highlighted items identified during Q4 2017, the Company reported a net loss from continuing operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 within our GAAP Consolidated Statement of Operations, while reporting income on a non-GAAP basis over the same periods. An adjustment is reflected to correct for the dilution of 7.2 million dilutive shares outstanding in Q4 2017 and 6.4 million dilutive shares outstanding for the full-year 2017.
