PINNACLE WEST REPORTS 2017 FULL-YEAR AND FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS

•Full-year results benefit from strong operational performance and regulatory settlement

•Annual customer growth increases 1.8 percent

•Company updates 2018 guidance

PHOENIX - Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $488.5 million, or $4.35 per diluted share, for full-year 2017. This result compares with net income of $442.0 million, or $3.95 per share, in 2016.

“Led by strong operational performance and a regulatory settlement that allows us to continue investing in a smarter and cleaner energy infrastructure, 2017 proved to be another solid year for our company,” said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Don Brandt. “Our employees once again did an excellent job running and maintaining our generation fleet and electric grid, and ensuring that our 1.2 million customers received the reliable electrical service they have come to expect from us.” 

Arizona Public Service Co.’s power reliability for the year remained among the strongest in the industry. The typical APS customer experienced less than one outage (0.75 power outages compared to a national industry median of 1.12 interruptions) over the course of the entire year - a new company record. This performance was especially impressive, Brandt said, considering the company also set an all-time peak demand record in June, breaking the prior record which had stood for 11 years. 

The Company’s regulatory and rate settlement, which was approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission, continues Arizona’s solar leadership and brings substantial benefits to the state while offering customers more choice and control through new rate options.

Brandt cited several additional examples of the Company’s 2017 achievements:

•For the sixth straight year, Pinnacle West increased its common dividend, raising it by 6.1 percent. In addition, Pinnacle West’s total return to shareholders was 12.7 percent, which compared favorably with a 10.6 percent return for the S&P 1500 Electric Utilities Index.

•Palo Verde achieved its 26th consecutive year as the nation’s largest power producer - producing 32.3 million megawatt-hours of carbon-free electricity. The plant achieved a 

93.8 percent capacity factor and completed both its spring and fall planned refueling outages in 30 days each - a first in plant history.

•The Company maintained its top-decile safety performance as employees’ vigilant focus led to one of the safest years on record.

Looking to the near future, Brandt said the company will maximize its regulatory settlement to continue creating value for customers and shareholders alike. “One of our top priorities from the settlement is lowering customer bills following the federal corporate tax cuts,” he said. “If approved by the Commission, the $119 million tax decrease will offset the $95 million revenue increase that resulted from our rate review this past fall.”

Brandt said the company also will remain at the forefront of innovative and advanced grid technologies (including batteries, microgrids and electric vehicle charging stations) to help the Company better manage customer demand, while strengthening an already solid record of reliable service.

The 2017 full-year financial results comparison was positively impacted by the following major factors:

•The Company’s regulatory settlement, which included APS’s first retail base rate increase in five years, increased results by $0.30 per share. The settlement became effective Aug. 19, 2017.

•Higher transmission revenues improved earnings by $0.23 per share.

•Retail electricity sales increased earnings $0.13 per share due in part to higher retail revenue from customer growth, which improved 1.8 percent compared to a year ago, as well as higher average effective prices due to customer usage patterns.

•Higher recovery of lost revenue resulting from customer energy efficiency and distributed generation programs (also known as lost fixed cost recovery) contributed $0.08 per share compared to 2016.

•The effects of weather variations improved the Company’s earnings by $0.03 per share.

•The net effect of miscellaneous items increased results $0.03 per share.

The above positive factors were offset in part by the following factors:

•Operating expenses, including higher depreciation and amortization and increased taxes other than income taxes, reduced results by $0.37 per share compared with the prior-year, primarily due to increased plant in service.

•Higher operations and maintenance expenses reduced results by $0.03 per share. The increased costs were largely the result of increased employee benefit costs and higher corporate support expenses related to information technology and implementation of new customer systems. These costs were partially offset by lower Palo Verde operating costs, as well as a decrease in fossil generation costs.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Pinnacle West reported lower consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $21.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. This result compares with net income of $53.2 million, or $0.47 per share, for the same period a year ago.

The 2017 fourth-quarter results comparison versus the same quarter in 2016 was positively impacted by the retail base rate increase, higher retail revenue, and an increase in transmission revenues. These factors were more than offset by higher operating expenses, the effects of weather and a higher effective tax rate.

Financial Outlook

For 2018, Pinnacle West estimates its consolidated earnings guidance will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per diluted share, and expects to achieve a consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5 percent. The Company increased its earnings guidance expectations from a previously disclosed range of $4.25 to $4.45 per share.
