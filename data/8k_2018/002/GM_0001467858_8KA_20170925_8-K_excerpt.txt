EXPLANATORY NOTE

This Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends the current report on Form 8-K, dated September 25, 2017, that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 29, 2017 (the “Original Form 8-K”) by General Motors Company (the “Company”), concerning the Company’s decision to engage Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) as its independent registered public accounting firm following the completion of the audit services provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”) for the year ending December 31, 2017 and the filing of the Company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “2017 Annual Report”) on February 6, 2018.

ITEM 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

As previously announced in the Original Form 8-K, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the engagement of EY as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the Company’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Deloitte continued as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2017. On February 6, 2018, when the Company filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 with the SEC, Deloitte completed its audit of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for such fiscal year, and the Company’s retention of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the audit of Company’s consolidated U.S. GAAP financial statements ended as of that date. 

Deloitte’s reports on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. 

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, and the subsequent interim period through February 6, 2018, the effective date of Deloitte’s dismissal, there were: (i) no disagreements within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions between the Company and Deloitte on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Deloitte’s satisfaction, would have caused Deloitte to make reference thereto in their reports; and (ii) no “reportable events” within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 

The Company has requested that Deloitte furnish a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or not it agrees with the above statements. A copy of Deloitte’s letter, dated February 12, 2018, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K/A.

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 and the subsequent interim period through February 6, 2018, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf has consulted with EY regarding: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specific transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company’s financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company that EY concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing, or financial reporting issue; (ii) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions; or (iii) any reportable event within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
