Miami, January 10, 2018 -- Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B), one of the nation’s largest homebuilders, today reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended November 30, 2017. Fourth quarter net earnings attributable to Lennar in 2017 were $309.6 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, compared to $313.5 million, or $1.31 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016, as adjusted for Class B stock dividend. Net earnings attributable to Lennar for the year ended November 30, 2017 were $810.5 million, or $3.38 per diluted share, compared to $911.8 million, or $3.86 per diluted share for the year ended November 30, 2016, as adjusted for Class B stock dividend.

Stuart Miller, Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, "We are pleased to announce a strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2017, as we continued to execute on our strategies in all of our operating businesses. Although we missed fourth quarter, bottom-line guidance because a single, strategic transaction shifted into the first quarter of 2018, our core operating performance exceeded expectations. The proceeds from the shifted transaction will now benefit from a much lower federal tax rate.”

Mr. Miller continued, “Our fourth quarter operating success was driven by focused execution in the field, favorable economic conditions in our markets and by managing a quick rebound from the two major hurricanes we experienced at the beginning of the quarter. Our results also benefitted from strong demand for homes, low unemployment, favorable interest rates and increased consumer confidence. General enthusiasm for the strength of the economy, combined with the added tailwinds of recent tax law changes, continue to propel the housing market forward.”

“Our homebuilding operating strategies produced strong results in the fourth quarter as our gross and operating margins were 22.4% and 14.0%, respectively, while our home deliveries and new orders increased 5% and 12%, respectively, compared to last year. Additionally, we continue to focus on strategic innovation in every aspect of our business to drive down S,G&A expenses and improve profitability.”

“Complementing our homebuilding business, our Financial Services business reported earnings of $42.1 million in our fourth quarter. Although these results are down 18% from the prior year, the decrease was primarily due to a significantly lower number of refinance transactions.”

"Our Multifamily business generated $38.6 million of earnings in the fourth quarter, driven by the sale of two apartment properties by its joint ventures. With its $9.1 billion geographically diversified pipeline of multifamily product, this segment continues to grow while capitalizing on future development opportunities.”

“Our homebuilding business and financial services operations continue to be the primary drivers of our quarterly results and earnings growth, while our ancillary segments continue to mature as independent businesses and create significant value.”

Mr. Miller concluded, "Our company is very well positioned for future growth and we look forward to another strong year in 2018. Our pending strategic combination with CalAtlantic, which is scheduled to close on February 12, 2018, will add to the future growth of our company as we strategically combine two great companies in markets that we know well with products that we know well, to create the leading homebuilder in the country.”

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017 COMPARED TO 

THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2016 

Lennar Homebuilding

Revenues from home sales increased 14% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $3.3 billion from $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 5% increase in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, and an 8% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 8,614 homes in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 8,206 homes in the fourth quarter of 2016. There was an increase in home deliveries in all of the Company's Homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, except Homebuilding East that was slightly down from prior year due to the impact of Hurricane Irma on deliveries in the fourth quarter. The average sales price of homes delivered, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to $387,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $357,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $23,500 per home delivered in the fourth quarter of 2017, or 5.7% as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to $23,700 per home delivered in the same period last year, or 6.2% as a percentage of home sales revenue. The improvement in sales incentives was primarily due to the Homebuilding West segment.

Gross margins on home sales were $747.5 million, or 22.4%, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $683.5 million, or 23.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to an increase in land and construction costs per home, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $281.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $256.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, from 8.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to a decrease in external broker commissions as a percentage of revenues from home sales and improved operating leverage.

Gross profits on land sales were $21.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $24.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $19.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $24.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was primarily attributable to the Company's share of valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuilding's unconsolidated entities. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was primarily attributable to the Company's share of net operating losses associated with the new FivePoint unconsolidated entity formed as the result of the FivePoint combination in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

Lennar Homebuilding other income, net, was $10.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $9.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

4-4-4

Lennar Homebuilding interest expense was $81.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 ($73.4 million was included in costs of homes sold, $5.9 million in costs of land sold and $2.4 million in other interest expense), compared to $73.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 ($69.4 million was included in costs of homes sold, $2.6 million in costs of land sold and $1.3 million in other interest expense). Interest expense included in costs of homes sold increased primarily due to an increase in home deliveries.

Lennar Financial Services

Operating earnings for the Lennar Financial Services segment were $42.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $51.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating earnings decreased primarily due to decreased profitability in the segment's mortgage operations as a result of a significant decline in refinance transactions, which led to both lower origination volume and profit per loan.

Rialto

Operating earnings for the Rialto segment were $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 (which included $12.0 million of operating loss and an add back of $14.2 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests). Operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $8.0 million (which included $0.2 million of operating loss and an add back of $8.2 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests). The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to a decrease in Rialto Mortgage Finance ("RMF") securitization revenues as a result of lower volume and an increase in REO and loan impairments, partially offset by an increase in interest income, incentive income related to carried interest distributions from the Rialto real estate funds and a decrease in general and administrative expenses.

Lennar Multifamily

Operating earnings for the Lennar Multifamily segment were $38.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $41.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in profitability was primarily due to the segment's $43.8 million share of gains related to the sale of two operating properties by Lennar Multifamily's unconsolidated entities in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the segment's $47.2 million share of gains related to the sale of four operating properties by Lennar Multifamily's unconsolidated entities in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Corporate General and Administrative Expenses

Corporate general and administrative expenses were $85.6 million, or 2.3% as a percentage of total revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $67.9 million, or 2.0% as a percentage of total revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to personnel and related expenses and professional expenses related to technology investments.

Noncontrolling Interests

Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $11.8 million and $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to a net loss related to the FDIC's interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that the

Company acquired in partnership with the FDIC in 2010, partially offset by net earnings related to the Lennar Homebuilding consolidated joint ventures.

YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017 COMPARED TO

YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2016

Lennar Homebuilding

Revenues from home sales increased 15% in the year ended November 30, 2017 to $11.0 billion from $9.6 billion in the year ended November 30, 2016. Revenues were higher primarily due to an 11% increase in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, and a 4% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 29,322 homes in the year ended November 30, 2017 from 26,481 homes in the year ended November 30, 2016. There was an increase in home deliveries in all of the Company's Homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other. The average sales price of homes delivered, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to $376,000 in the year ended November 30, 2017 from $361,000 in the year ended November 30, 2016. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $22,700 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2017, or 5.7% as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to $22,500 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2016, or 5.9% as a percentage of home sales revenue.

Gross margins on home sales were $2.4 billion, or 22.1%, in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $2.2 billion, or 23.0%, in the year ended November 30, 2016. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to the year ended November 30, 2016 primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.0 billion in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $898.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to 9.2% in the year ended November 30, 2017, from 9.4% in the year ended November 30, 2016, due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries.

Gross profits on land sales were $29.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $44.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2016.

Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $61.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $49.3 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. In the year ended November 30, 2017, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was attributable to the Company's share of net operating losses from its unconsolidated entities which were primarily driven by general and administrative expenses and valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuilding's unconsolidated entities, partially offset by profits from land sales. In the year ended November 30, 2016, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was primarily attributable to the Company's share of costs associated with the FivePoint combination as well as the Company's share of net operating losses associated with the new FivePoint unconsolidated entity formed as the result of this combination. This was partially offset by $12.7 million of equity in earnings from one of the Company's unconsolidated entities primarily due to sales of homesites to third parties.

6-6-6

Lennar Homebuilding other income, net, totaled $22.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $52.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. In the year ended November 30, 2016, other income, net, included management fee income and a profit participation related to Lennar Homebuilding's strategic joint ventures and gains on the sale of several clubhouses.

Lennar Homebuilding loss due to litigation of $140 million in the year ended November 30, 2017 was related to litigation regarding a contract the Company entered into in 2005 to purchase property in Maryland. As a result of the litigation, the Company purchased the property for $114 million, which approximated the Company's estimate of fair value for the property. In addition, the Company paid approximately $124 million in interest and other closing costs and has accrued for the amount it expects to pay as reimbursement for attorney's fees.

Lennar Homebuilding interest expense was $277.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2017 ($260.7 million was included in costs of homes sold, $10.0 million in costs of land sold and $7.2 million in other interest expense), compared to $245.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2016 ($235.1 million was included in costs of homes sold, $5.3 million in costs of land sold and $4.6 million in other interest expense). Interest expense included in costs of homes sold increased primarily due to an increase in home deliveries.

Lennar Financial Services

Operating earnings for the Lennar Financial Services segment were $155.5 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to $163.6 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. Operating earnings decreased due to lower profitability in the segment's mortgage operations as a result of a decrease in refinance transactions, which led to both lower origination volume and profit per loan. This was partially offset by higher profit per transaction in the segment's title operations and earnings from the real estate brokerage business which was acquired as part of the WCI Communities, Inc. ("WCI") acquisition in February 2017.

Rialto

Operating earnings for the Rialto segment were $23.6 million in the year ended November 30, 2017 (which included $22.5 million of operating loss and an add back of $46.1 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests). Operating earnings in the year ended November 30, 2016 were $2.1 million (which included $16.7 million of operating loss and an add back of $18.8 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests). The increase in operating earnings was primarily related to an increase in incentive income related to carried interest distributions from the Rialto real estate funds, as well as an increase in management fee income and equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities. This was partially offset by an increase in REO and loan impairments and general and administrative expenses. In addition, the year ended November 30, 2016 included a $16.0 million write-off of uncollectible receivables related to a hospital, which was acquired through the resolution of one of Rialto's loans from a 2010 portfolio.

7-7-7

Lennar Multifamily

Operating earnings for the Lennar Multifamily segment were $73.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2017, compared to operating earnings of $71.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2016. The increase in profitability was primarily due to the segment's $96.7 million share of gains as a result of the sale of seven operating properties by Lennar Multifamily's unconsolidated entities, compared to the segment's $91.0 million share of gains as a result of the sale of seven operating properties by Lennar Multifamily's unconsolidated entities in the year ended November 30, 2016.

Corporate General and Administrative Expenses

The increase was primarily due to personnel and related expenses and professional expenses related to technology investments.

Noncontrolling Interests

Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests were ($38.7) million and $1.2 million in the years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended November 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to a net loss related to the FDIC's interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that the Company acquired in partnership with the FDIC in 2010. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests during the year ended November 30, 2016 were primarily attributable to earnings related to Lennar Homebuilding consolidated joint ventures, partially offset by a net loss related to the FDIC's interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that the Company acquired in partnership with the FDIC.

(3)Amount represents interest incurred related to Lennar Homebuilding debt.

(4)EBIT is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as earnings before interest and taxes. This financial measure has been presented because the Company finds it important and useful in evaluating its performance and believes that it helps readers of the Company's financial statements compare its operations with those of its competitors. Although management finds EBIT to be an important measure in conducting and evaluating the Company's operations, this measure has limitations as an analytical tool as it is not reflective of the actual profitability generated by the Company during the period. Management compensates for the limitations of using EBIT by using this non-GAAP measure only to supplement the Company's GAAP results. Due to the limitations discussed, EBIT should not be viewed in isolation, as it is not a substitute for GAAP measures.

(1)Net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net Lennar Homebuilding debt (Lennar Homebuilding debt less Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents) divided by total capital (net Lennar Homebuilding debt plus stockholders' equity). The Company believes the ratio of net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital is a relevant and a useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in Lennar Homebuilding operations. However, because net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, this financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, this non-GAAP financial measure should be used to supplement the Company's GAAP results.
