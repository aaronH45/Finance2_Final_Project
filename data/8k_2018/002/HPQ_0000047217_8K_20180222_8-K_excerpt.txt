Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

  The information contained in this Item 2.02 and in the accompanying Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the“Exchange Act”), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

  On February 22, 2018, HP Inc. (the “Company”) issued a news release relating to the results of operations for its fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2018. A copy of the news release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Effective at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company implemented an organizational change to align its segment and business unit financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. The organizational change resulted in the transfer of a portion of long life consumables from Commercial to Supplies within the Printing segment. Certain revenues related to service arrangements, which are being eliminated for the purposes of reporting the Company’s consolidated net revenue, have now been reclassified from Other to segments. The Company has reflected this change to its segment and business unit information in prior reporting periods on an as-if basis. The reporting change had no impact to previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share. 

 As a result of this change, the Company has released modified quarterly and full year segment financial results and statements of business unit revenue for fiscal 2017 and 2016, which are attached hereto in Exhibit 99.1.
