Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

On January 27, 2018, the Board of Directors of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (the "Company") approved and adopted amendments to the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), to permit special meetings of the stockholders of the Company to be called by stockholders holding at least 25% of the voting stock of the Company. The stockholders calling a meeting are required to submit a request setting forth in writing, among other things, (i) a description of the specific purpose of the meeting, the matters proposed to be acted on at the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, (ii) the name and address of each such stockholder, (iii) the number of shares of capital stock owned of record or beneficially by each such stockholder, (iv) documentary evidence that the requesting stockholders in the aggregate own at least 25% of the voting stock of the Company, (v) all information relating to each such stockholder that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to applicable securities laws, (vi) the information required by the Bylaws for matters to be properly brought by stockholders before an annual meeting and as to the stockholders requesting the meeting, (vii) a representation that each requesting stockholder, or one or more representatives of each such stockholder, intends to appear in person or by proxy at the special meeting to present the proposal(s) or business to be brought before the special meeting, and (viii) an agreement that any disposition of shares prior to the special meeting shall be deemed a revocation of such special meeting request with respect to such disposed shares. 

A special meeting request will not be valid if it (i) does not comply with the Bylaws, the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), or applicable law (ii) relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under the Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law, (iii) is an item of business that is the same or substantially similar to a matter that was presented at a meeting of stockholders occurring within 90 days preceding the date of the stockholders’ request for a special meeting, or to a matter that is included in the Company’s notice to be brought before a meeting of stockholders that has been called but not yet held, (iv) is delivered during the period commencing 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the previous year’s annual meeting of stockholders and ending on the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders, or (v) was made in violation of applicable securities laws.
