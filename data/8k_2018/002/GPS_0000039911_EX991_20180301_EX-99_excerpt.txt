•Delivers Fiscal Year 2017 Gross Margin Expansion of 200 Basis Points.

•Distributed $676 Million in Fiscal Year 2017 to Shareholders Through Share Repurchases and Dividends.

SAN FRANCISCO – March 1, 2018 – Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) today reported fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results and provided guidance for fiscal year 2018. 

“Our strong positive comp and margin expansion during the critical holiday quarter affirms our balanced growth strategy,” said Art Peck, president and chief executive officer, Gap Inc. “Our outlook for 2018 demonstrates confidence in our strategy and a meaningful step up in earnings capacity for the company.”

“We are positioning the company for long term growth,” said Teri List-Stoll, executive vice president and chief financial officer, Gap Inc. “In addition to leveraging productivity initiatives to fund investments in the business, recent tax reform changes provide a meaningful increase in future earnings.”

On a reported basis, the company’s diluted earnings per share were $0.52 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and $2.14 for fiscal year 2017, which includes $34 million of provisional net tax impacts related to tax reform as a result of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”).

Excluding the net provisional impacts related to tax reform and the second quarter benefit from insurance proceeds related to the Fishkill fire of $64 million, the company’s adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.61 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and $2.13 for fiscal year 2017, inclusive of the 53rd week, compared with fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.51 and $2.02, respectively. 

The company noted that foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted adjusted earnings per share for fiscal year 2017 by an estimated $0.08, or about 4 percentage points of earnings per share growth on an adjusted basis1. Please see the reconciliations of adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, in the tables at the end of this press release.

________________________________

1 In estimating the earnings per share impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company estimates current gross margins using the appropriate prior year rates (including the impact of merchandise-related hedges), translates current period foreign earnings at prior year rates, and excludes the year-over-year earnings impact of balance sheet remeasurement and gains or losses from non-merchandise-related foreign currency hedges. This is done in order to enhance the visibility of business results excluding the direct impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Fourth quarter fiscal year 2017 net sales increased 8 percent to $4.8 billion and fiscal year 2017 net sales were $15.9 billion. Fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 net sales details appear in the tables at the end of this press release. 

The company noted that fiscal year 2017 had 53 weeks versus 52 weeks in fiscal year 2016. As a result, the company’s results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and for the fiscal year 2017 include the additional week, while comparable sales calculations exclude the 53rd week. 

Additional Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Results 

Operating Margin: The company’s operating margin for fiscal year 2017 was 9.3 percent compared with 7.7 percent last year. 

The company’s adjusted operating margin for fiscal year 2017 was 8.9 percent compared with adjusted operating margin of 8.9 percent last year. Please see the reconciliation of adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, in the tables at the end of this press release.

Operating Expenses: Fourth quarter fiscal year 2017 operating expenses were $1.36 billion compared with $1.20 billion last year. Excluding $26 million in restructuring charges, a $71 million goodwill impairment charge related to Intermix, and a $73 million gain from insurance proceeds related to the fire that occurred on the company’s Fishkill, New York distribution center campus recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, operating expenses were up about $187 million, on an adjusted basis. Please see the reconciliation of adjusted operating expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure, in the tables at the end of this press release.

Total operating expenses for fiscal year 2017 were $4.6 billion. Excluding the $64 million gain from insurance proceeds related to the Fishkill fire recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 and restructuring costs of $197 million recorded in fiscal year 2016 and other fourth quarter fiscal 2016 items mentioned above, fiscal year 2017 operating expenses were up about $397 million when compared with last year, on an adjusted basis. The company noted that adjusted operating expenses were impacted by an increase in variable expenses as a result of higher sales and the addition of the 53rd week. Please see the reconciliation of adjusted operating expenses, a non-GAAP financial measure, in the tables at the end of this press release.

Effective Tax Rate: The effective tax rate was 46.5 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. The fourth quarter tax rate reflects $34 million of net provisional impacts related to the enactment of the U.S. TCJA. This net provisional impact is primarily related to the one-time transition tax on foreign earnings not previously subject to U.S. tax, re-measurement of U.S. deferred taxes partially offset by the reversal of deferred taxes provided on certain foreign earnings and a one-time income tax benefit related to legal entity structuring that was also impacted by TCJA. The company continues to analyze TCJA and the provisional amounts will be finalized in fiscal year 2018. 

Excluding the net provisional impacts related to TCJA, the adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 was about 9 percentage points lower than the reported effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 was 40.4 percent. Excluding the net provisional impacts related to TCJA, the adjusted fiscal year 2017 effective tax rate was about 2 percentage points lower.

Inventory: At the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, total inventory was up 9 percent year-over-year.

The company noted the increase is primarily due to timing of receipts, particularly with the 53rd week, and the negative impact of foreign exchange. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents: The company ended fiscal year 2017 with about $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. For fiscal year 2017, free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, net of insurance proceeds related to loss of property and equipment, was $715 million, reflecting the timing of lease payments and a larger increase in inventory from the beginning to end of the fiscal year when compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. Please see the reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from the GAAP financial measure in the tables at the end of this press release.

Cash Distribution: During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, the company repurchased 0.5 million shares for $15 million and ended the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 with 389 million shares outstanding.

The company paid a dividend of $0.23 per share during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017.

Capital Expenditures: Fiscal year 2017 capital expenditures were $731 million including costs associated with the rebuilding of the company’s Fishkill, New York distribution center campus and related supply chain spend, of $167 million. The company noted the majority of these costs are expected to be covered by insurance proceeds. Please see the reconciliation of adjusted capital expenditures, a non-GAAP financial measure, from the GAAP financial measure in the tables at the end of this press release.

Real Estate: The company ended fiscal year 2017 with 3,594 store locations in 45 countries, of which 3,165 were company-operated. 

2018 Outlook

The company noted that fiscal year 2018 is a 52-week year versus the 53-week fiscal year 2017.

Earnings per Share: For fiscal year 2018, the company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.70 and comparable sales for fiscal year 2018 are expected to be flat to up slightly. 

This guidance includes the estimated positive impact of approximately $0.07 due to foreign currency fluctuations at current exchange rates. 

Effective Tax Rate: For fiscal year 2018, the company expects the effective tax rate to be about 26 percent, based on the company’s provisional estimates of the impacts of TCJA.

Cash Distribution: Underscoring the company’s continued commitment to providing an attractive cost return, in a separate press release today, the company announced that its Board of Directors approved plans to increase the company’s annual dividend per share by over 5 percent to $0.97 for fiscal year 2018 and that its board of directors authorized a first quarter fiscal year 2018 dividend of $0.2425 per share.

Additionally, the company intends to continue its share repurchase program, currently expecting to repurchase approximately $100 million per quarter.

Capital Expenditures: With the additional flexibility provided by TCJA, the company expects capital spending to be approximately $800 million for fiscal year 2018, with a continued focus on transformative infrastructure investments to support its omni-channel and digital strategies, such as information technology and supply chain. 

Real Estate: In fiscal year 2018, the company expects to open about 25 company-operated stores, net of closures and repositions. In line with its strategy, the company expects store openings to be focused on Athleta and Old Navy locations, with closures weighted toward Gap brand and Banana Republic.

FREE CASH FLOW

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it

represents a measure of how much cash a company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after

the deduction of capital expenditures, net of insurance proceeds related to loss on property and equipment, as we

require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our

business. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important

driver of value creation. However, this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP

results.
