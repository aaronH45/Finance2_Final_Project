Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On January 24, 2018, United Rentals, Inc. (the “Company”) issued a press release reporting its results of operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. A copy of the press release is being furnished with this report as Exhibit 99.1.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

Certain information concerning our business, financial results and 2018 outlook that the Company expects to use at certain investor meetings and presentations can be accessed currently on the Company’s website, www.unitedrentals.com. Such information will be maintained on the Company’s website for at least the period of its use at such meetings and presentations or until superseded by more current information.

The presentation includes certain financial measures - free cash flow, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share (“adjusted EPS”) - that are “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of rental and non-rental equipment plus proceeds from sales of rental and non-rental equipment, and excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, (benefit) provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. Adjusted EPS represents EPS plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, the impact on interest expense related to the fair value adjustment of acquired RSC indebtedness, the impact on depreciation related to acquired fleet and property and equipment, the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet, merger related intangible asset amortization, asset impairment charge and the loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities and amendment of ABL facility.

The presentation includes reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest generally accepted accounting principles financial measures. The Company believes that: (i) free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements; (ii) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced; and (iii) adjusted EPS provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, none of these measures should be considered as alternatives to net income, cash flows from operating activities or earnings per share under GAAP as indicators of operating performance or liquidity.
