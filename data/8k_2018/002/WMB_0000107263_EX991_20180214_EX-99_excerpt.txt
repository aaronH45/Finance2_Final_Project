Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Financial Results

Williams reported unaudited fourth-quarter 2017 net income attributable to Williams of $1.687 billion, an improvement of $1.702 billion from fourth-quarter 2016. The favorable change was driven primarily by the remeasurement of Williams' deferred tax liabilities to reflect lower future tax payments expected due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Reform Act"). This resulted in the recognition of an income tax provision benefit of $1.9 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017. In addition, the absence of a $318 million impairment of equity method investments from fourth-quarter 2016 is also reflected in the improvement. Partially offsetting the increase was the impact of $713 million of non-cash charges at Williams Partners' Transco and Northwest Pipeline primarily related to regulatory liabilities resulting from the Tax Reform Act. 

For the year, Williams reported unaudited net income of $2.174 billion, a favorable change of $2.598 billion over the corresponding 12-month reporting period in 2016. The improvement was driven primarily by the net impact of the Tax Reform Act as described in the previous paragraph, a $1.095 billion gain associated with the sale of our ownership interest in the Geismar olefins facility, the absence of impairments of equity-method investments and higher revenues from Williams Partners' Atlantic-Gulf business. Partially offsetting the improvement was a net increase in impairments of certain assets and the absence of results associated with the Geismar olefins facility, which was sold July 6, 2017. 

Williams reported fourth-quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.160 billion, a $37 million increase from fourth-quarter 2016. Williams Partners' current businesses increased Adjusted EBITDA by $84 million in fourth-quarter 2017 vs. fourth-quarter 2016, driven in large part by $117 million increased fee-based revenues, due primarily to the growth in fee-based revenues in Williams Partners' Atlantic-Gulf and West businesses partially offset by $30 million in higher operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses. The $84 million improvement from Williams Partners' current businesses was partially offset by the absence of $47 million Adjusted EBITDA earned in fourth-quarter 2016 from the NGL & Petchem Services business primarily as a result of the sale of the Geismar olefins facility on July 6, 2017.

For the year, Williams reported Adjusted EBITDA of $4.531 billion, an increase of $95 million over fiscal 2016. The current businesses in the Williams Partners segment increased Adjusted EBITDA by $202 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The improvement was driven primarily by $147 million increased fee-based revenues driven primarily from new assets brought online by the Atlantic-Gulf business in the Williams Partners segment. Full-year 2017 results for the Williams Partners segment also benefited from $51 million increased commodity margins and $28 million from higher EBITDA from joint ventures, partially offset by $63 million higher O&M expenses. The $202 million improvement from Williams Partners' current businesses was partially offset by the absence of $157 million Adjusted EBITDA earned in 2016 from the NGL & Petchem Services business primarily as a result of the sale of the Geismar olefins facility on July 6, 2017.

CEO Perspective

Alan Armstrong, president and chief executive officer, made the following comments: 

"I am pleased with the organization's strong execution in 2017. Our organization has been working hard to keep its promises to our customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders with timely and safe delivery of our projects, including Transco’s ‘Big 5’ projects (Gulf Trace, Hillabee Phase 1, Dalton, New York Bay and Virginia Southside II). This is reflected in our financial results where we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range for Adjusted EBITDA, DCF and Cash Coverage ratios.

"We achieved these impressive results, which include improvement in year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA for both fourth-quarter and full-year 2017, in spite of the impact of multiple hurricanes and more than $3 billion in asset sales since September 2016. Our stable foundation of demand-driven expansions continues to grow our business. In 2018, we look forward to a full year of revenue from our ‘Big 5’ as well as contributions from our Atlantic Sunrise project later this year and the associated growth in Northeast gathering volumes.

"We also carried out our financial repositioning in January of 2017 in a way that positioned the company to fund an attractive slate of large-scale expansion projects without accessing public equity markets, strengthened distribution coverage, enhanced our credit profile, improved our cost of capital and underpinned our growth outlook. As a result of a full year of executing on the key aspects of our plan, we reduced Williams consolidated debt for the year by $3.3 billion and dramatically reduced our commodity exposure.

"As the Atlantic Sunrise project construction continues, the debottlenecking of the Northeast is starting to occur as other pipelines in the Northeast have also been placed in service recently or will be brought online in the near future. We are beginning to see some of the key fundamentals of our strategy take shape in the Northeast where we have a leading market share and a path to deliver long-term sustainable shareholder value. Volumes are increasing and our focus on executing the company’s natural gas-focused business strategy is producing predictable fee-based revenue growth backed by long-term commitments."

Business Segment Results

Williams’ business segments for financial reporting are Williams Partners and Other. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Williams Partners Segment

Comprised of our consolidated master limited partnership, WPZ, Williams Partners segment includes gas pipeline and midstream businesses. The gas pipeline business includes interstate natural gas pipelines and pipeline joint project investments. The midstream business provides natural gas gathering, treating, processing and compression services; NGL production, fractionation, storage, marketing and transportation; deepwater production handling and crude oil transportation services; and is comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries and joint project investments. 

Williams Partners reported fourth-quarter 2017 Modified EBITDA of $408 million, a decrease of $827 million from fourth-quarter 2016. The unfavorable change in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by the impact of $713 million of non-cash charges at the segment's Transco and Northwest Pipeline primarily related to regulatory liabilities established as a result of the recently enacted Tax Reform Act. Some of the rates charged to customers of our regulated natural gas pipelines are subject to periodic FERC rate case filings, which permit the recovery of an income tax allowance that includes a deferred income tax component in our recourse rates. As a result of the reduced income tax rate from the Tax Reform Act and the resulting regulatory liabilities, we expect that any future rate case settlements or proceedings before the FERC will be impacted by this lower income tax allowance. However, the actual amount and timing of any return of this regulatory liability to customers will be subject to negotiations in future rate proceedings. We expect that the amortization of the regulatory liability will be over an extended period of time (as much as 20 years or more). Considering all of these recourse rate-making elements, Transco still expects to file for increased cost-of-service rates in its upcoming initial rate filing in 2018.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by $37 million to $1.150 billion.The non-cash charges associated with the Tax Reform Act did not impact 2017 Adjusted EBITDA. Williams Partners' current businesses increased Adjusted EBITDA by $84 million in fourth-quarter 2017 vs. fourth-quarter 2016, driven by $117 million increased fee-based revenues, due primarily to the growth in fee-based revenues in Williams Partners' Atlantic-Gulf and West businesses, partially offset by$30 million in higher O&M and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. The $84 million improvement from Williams Partners' current businesses was partially offset by the absence of $47 million Adjusted EBITDA earned in fourth-quarter 2016 from the NGL & Petchem Services business primarily as a result of the sale of the Geismar olefins facility on July 6, 2017.

For the year, Williams Partners reported Modified EBITDA of $3.616 billion, a decrease of $248 million compared to results for full-year 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.472 billion, a $45 million increase over the corresponding 12-month reporting period. The unfavorable change in Modified EBITDA was driven primarily by the non-cash charges resulting from the Tax Reform Act as described in the previous paragraph. Results were also negatively impacted by impairments of assets, largely offset by the gain related to the sale of the Geismar facility. The non-

cash charges associated with the Tax Reform Act did not impact 2017 Adjusted EBITDA. Williams Partners' current businesses increased Adjusted EBITDA by $202 million in 2017 compared to 2016. The improvement was driven primarily by $147 million increased fee-based revenues driven largely by new assets brought online by the Atlantic-Gulf segment. Williams Partners' full-year 2017 results also benefited from $51 million increased commodity margins and $28 million higher EBITDA from joint ventures, partially offset by $63 million higher O&M expenses. The $202 million improvement from Williams Partners' current businesses was partially offset by the absence of $157 million Adjusted EBITDA earned in 2016 from the NGL & Petchem Services business primarily as a result of the sale of the Geismar olefins facility on July 6, 2017.

Williams Partners’ complete financial results for fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 are provided in the earnings news release issued today by Williams Partners.

Other Segment 

Williams’ Other segment reported fourth-quarter 2017 Modified EBITDA of ($90) million, a decrease of $82 million from fourth-quarter 2016, driven by a $63 million regulatory charge associated with the Tax Reform Act. Adjusted EBITDA remained stable at $10 million. 

For the year, Williams’ Other segment reported Modified EBITDA of ($150) million, an increase of $392 million due primarily to the absence of a second-quarter 2016, $406 million impairment charge associated with the company's former Canadian business that was sold in September 2016. Adjusted EBITDA realized a $50 million improvement to $59 million. Both measures benefited from $29 million of higher income associated with a regulatory asset, and was primarily driven by our increased ownership in WPZ.

Notable Accomplishments 

On Dec. 5, 2017, the Williams Partners segment announced that it had successfully placed into service its Virginia Southside II expansion project, the fifth of Transco’s “Big 5” expansions to be placed into service in 2017. These five, fully-contracted expansion projects (Gulf Trace, Hillabee Phase 1, Dalton, New York Bay and Virginia Southside II) combined to add more than 2.8 million dekatherms per day (Dth/d) of firm transportation capacity to the Transco pipeline system in 2017, contributing to the increase of Transco’s design capacity by approximately 25 percent.

Williams' Credit Profile Update 

The company strengthened its balance sheet and credit profile during the year with an over $500 million reduction of the Williams Companies' corporate-level debt in addition to the nearly $2.1 billion debt reduction at Williams Partners and more than $700 million increase in consolidated cash. As of the end of 2017, Williams had corporate level debt of $4.4 billion, in addition to Williams Partners' debt of $16.5 billion and consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $899 million, which the company intends to use primarily to fund growth capital expenditures and long-term investments at Williams Partners.

2018 Guidance

Current guidance for 2018 is set out in the following table. As noted in the table below, Williams Partners' Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow estimates for 2018 have recently been impacted by non-cash adjustments related to the new GAAP revenue recognition standard and Tax Reform Act. For Williams Partners' Adjusted EBITDA, the unfavorable non-cash impacts of these two items were approximately $120 million for the new GAAP revenue recognition standard and approximately $30 million for tax reform primarily due to Northwest Pipeline even though rates on Northwest Pipeline remain unchanged until the next rate case cycle expected to occur in 2021. 

The main effect of the new GAAP revenue recognition standard was to extend the amortization of deferred revenue associated with certain 2016 contract restructurings and pre-payments by approximately 10 years resulting in lower 2018 and 2019 revenue and then higher revenue amounts through 2029. Furthermore, as a result of the extended revenue amortization period under the new GAAP revenue standard, we have prospectively discontinued the adjustment which removed the DCF associated with these 2016 contract restructuring prepayments. Consequently, DCF is expected to be approximately $140 million higher in 2018 than it otherwise would have been absent this prospective change.

4

For Williams, the above-described 2018 guidance for Williams Partners will support 10 to 15 percent dividend growth and at least 1.35x dividend-coverage ratio.

Non-GAAP Measures

This news release and accompanying materials may include certain financial measures – Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income (“earnings”), adjusted earnings per share, cash available for dividends and other uses, WMB economic DCF, dividend coverage ratio, economic coverage ratio, distributable cash flow and cash distribution coverage ratio – that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC. 

5

Our segment performance measure, Modified EBITDA, is defined as net income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments.

Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management believes these measures provide investors meaningful insight into results from ongoing operations.

Cash available for dividends and other uses is defined as cash received from our ownership in WPZ and Adjusted EBITDA from our Other segment, less interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated with our Other segment. We also calculate the ratio of cash available for dividends to the total cash dividends paid (dividend coverage ratio). This measure reflects our cash available for dividends relative to actual cash dividends paid. We further adjust these metrics to include Williams’ proportional share of WPZ’s distributable cash flow in excess of distributions, resulting in WMB economic DCF and economic coverage ratio.

For Williams Partners L.P., we define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures, cash portion of interest expense, income attributable to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, plus WPZ restricted stock unit non-cash compensation expense and certain other adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these items of our equity-method investments.

We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash distributed (cash distribution coverage ratio). This measure reflects the amount of distributable cash flow relative to our cash distribution. 

This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of the Company’s assets and the cash that the business is generating.

Neither Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, cash available for dividends and other uses or distributable cash flow are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
