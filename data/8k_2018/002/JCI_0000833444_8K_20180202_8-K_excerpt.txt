Item 8.01.Other Events.

On February 2, 2018, George R. Oliver, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Johnson Controls International plc (the “Company”) entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan with respect to 544,240 ordinary shares of Company stock issuable upon exercise of option awards scheduled to expire in 2018 and 2019. The trading plan, executed during the Company’s most recent open trading window, becomes effective on June 1, 2018. Under the plan, options are expected to be exercised on a monthly basis through September 1, 2019, with a portion of the ordinary shares from each exercise to be sold in the market to cover the exercise price and taxes associated with the exercise of the options, regardless of whether Mr. Oliver becomes aware of any material non-public information concerning the Company. As the options are exercised pursuant to the plan, Mr. Oliver’s ownership of the Company’s ordinary shares will increase. 

Mr. Oliver entered into the plan as part of his personal long-term financial and tax planning strategy and to provide for an orderly liquidation of the options prior to their expiration. Any transactions under the 10b5-1 plan will be publicly reported through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
