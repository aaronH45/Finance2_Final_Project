Item 8.01. Other Events.  

On January 29, 2018, Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (“Keurig”) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. announced that the companies had entered into a definitive merger agreement to create a combined New York Stock Exchange-listed public company (the “transaction”). Upon closing of the transaction, the combined company will be renamed Keurig Dr Pepper (“KDP”).  

As part of the transaction, we will exchange our ownership interest in Keurig for an equity interest in KDP. We do not intend to invest new capital in KDP in connection with the transaction. We currently hold a 24.24% ownership interest in Keurig. Following the closing of the transaction, we expect our equity interest in KDP will be 13-14%.  

In connection with the closing of the transaction, we will enter into an agreement that will govern our rights and obligations as an investor in KDP. This agreement will provide that we may not sell or otherwise dispose of our shares in KDP for a period of six months following the closing. We will also have the right to nominate two directors to the KDP board from the closing of the transaction. If our equity interest declines to less than 8%, we would have the right to nominate one director to the KDP board. If our interest declines to less than 5%, we would not have the right to appoint a director.  

This Item 8.01 contains a number of forward-looking statements. Words, and variations of words, such as “will,” “expect” and similar expressions are intended to identify our forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those related to the closing of the transaction and our investment and governance rights in, and obligations related to, KDP following closing. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the timely and successful closing of the transaction and the finalization of the terms of our participation in the transaction. Please also see our risk factors, as they may be amended from time to time, set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. We disclaim and do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement in this Item 8.01, except as required by applicable law or regulation.
