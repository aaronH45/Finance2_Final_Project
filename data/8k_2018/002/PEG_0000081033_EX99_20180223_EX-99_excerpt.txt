PSEG ANNOUNCES 2017 RESULTS  

NET INCOME OF $3.10 PER SHARE  

Non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $2.93 Per Share  

Common Dividend Increased 4.7%  

Non-GAAP 2018 Operating Earnings Guidance $3.00 - $3.20 Per Share  

(February 23, 2018 – Newark, NJ) Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) reported 2017 Net Income of $1,574 million, or $3.10 per share, as compared to Net Income of $887 million, or $1.75 per share, for 2016. Non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the year 2017 were $1,488 million, or $2.93 per share, compared to $1,475 million, or $2.90 per share for 2016. Compared to 2016, Net Income for 2017 benefited from a revaluation of deferred tax liabilities associated with a reduction in the Federal corporate tax rate, lower reserves for leveraged lease impairments, and gains on Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) offset by higher expenses associated with the retirement of the Hudson and Mercer generating stations.  

PSEG also reported Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $956 million, or $1.88 per share. This compares to a Net Loss of $98 million, or $0.19 per share, for the 2016 fourth quarter. Non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $289 million, or $0.57 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2016 non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $279 million, or $0.54 per share. Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2017 reflects a revaluation of deferred tax liabilities associated with a reduction in the Federal corporate tax rate and NDT and Mark-to-Market activity. The Net Loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects incremental depreciation expense and other expenses associated with the early retirement of the Hudson and Mercer generating stations in addition to NDT and Mark-to-Market activity.  

“We ended 2017 on a strong note with operating earnings for the year above the mid-point of our guidance” said Ralph Izzo, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Successful execution of PSE&G’s capital program and strong operations at PSEG Power contributed to our full year results. The successes of 2017 were the result of the outstanding effort of our  

 dedicated workforce, and position us well as we seek to continue to execute on our strategy to provide long-term value to our shareholders by meeting the needs of our customers and the communities we serve. The recent action by the Board of Directors to increase the common dividend by 4.7% to the indicative annual rate of $1.80 per share is recognition of our financial strength and commitment to growth.”  

The tables below provide a reconciliation of PSEG’s Net Income to non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the full year and fourth quarter. See Attachment 11 for a complete list of items excluded from Net Income in the determination of non-GAAP Operating Earnings.

Ralph Izzo went on to say, “We enter 2018 from a position of financial strength aided by a strong balance sheet, continued execution of our strategic growth objectives and tax reform. For 2018, we forecast 6% growth in non-GAAP Operating Earnings at the mid-point of our guidance of $3.00 - $3.20 per share. This is possible, despite the challenges we continue to face in wholesale power markets especially at our nuclear plants, due to continued growth at PSE&G and a $0.16 per share benefit to the bottom line of our unregulated businesses from a reduction in the federal tax rate.”  

The following table outlines PSEG’s 2017 non-GAAP Operating Earnings by subsidiary and expectations for 2018.

Non-GAAP Operating Earnings Review and Outlook by Operating Subsidiary  

See Attachments 5 and 6 for detail regarding the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year reconciliations for each of PSEG’s businesses.  

PSE&G  

PSE&G reported Net Income of $220 million ($0.43 per share) for the fourth quarter bringing full year Net Income to $973 million ($1.92 per share). Non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $210 million ($0.41 per share) bringing non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the full year to $963 million ($1.90 per share). On a comparative basis, PSE&G reported Net Income of $193 million ($0.38 per share) and $889 million ($1.75 per share) for the fourth quarter and full year 2016, respectively.  

PSE&G’s Net Income in the fourth quarter reflects continued growth in earnings on its increased level of investment in Transmission and Distribution infrastructure.  

Growth in PSE&G’s investment in transmission improved quarter-over-quarter Net Income comparisons by $0.03 per share. Recovery of investment in gas distribution made under PSE&G’s Energy Strong and Gas System Modernization Programs increased quarter-over-quarter Net Income by $0.01 per share. Colder than normal weather as compared to more normal weather conditions in the year-ago quarter improved Net Income by $0.01 per share. An increase in O&M expenses associated with preventative and corrective maintenance reduced quarter over quarter Net Income by $0.02 per share.  

Electric sales, on a weather-normalized basis, declined 0.9% in the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago quarter as a decline in Residential and Industrial sales more than offset growth in Commercial sales. For the year, weather-normalized electric sales declined 0.4%. Weather-normalized gas sales for the quarter declined 1.0% as a reduction in sales to Residential customers was partially offset by growth in sales to Commercial and Industrial customers. For the year, growth in weather-normalized gas sales of 1.2% was led by growth from Commercial and Industrial customers.  

PSE&G, in January 2018, filed a distribution base rate case as required by the NJ Board of Public Utilities (BPU) as a condition of approval in 2014 of its Energy Strong Program. The filing reflected an approximate one percent increase in revenues ($95 million) primarily to recover investments made to strengthen electric and gas distribution systems. In its filing, PSE&G requested that these rates take into account an approximate $130 million reduction in the revenue requirement as a result of the federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% provided in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), a one-time credit for estimated excess income taxes collected between January 1, 2018 and the time the rates go into effect, and the flow back to customers of certain additional tax benefits. The filing will be updated to incorporate the full impact of the Tax Act including the potential impacts of a recent BPU order requiring utilities to reflect the reduction in the federal tax rate in bills effective April 1, 2018. PSE&G anticipates the new base rates will take effect in the fourth quarter of 2018.  

In January 2018, PSE&G filed a revised 2018 Annual Transmission Formula Rate with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reducing the 2018 transmission annual revenue requirement by $148 million to reflect the lower federal corporate income tax rate. Combined, the lower federal tax requirement reduces PSE&G’s annual distribution and transmission revenue requirement by approximately $275 million.  

PSE&G’s $3.1 billion investment in 2017 to upgrade and expand its transmission and distribution system led to a 12.5% increase in rate base to $17 billion at year-end.  

For the 16th year in a row, PSE&G’s work to protect and strengthen the system yielded recognition as the most reliable electric utility in the Mid-Atlantic region.  

PSE&G’s Net Income for 2018 is forecasted at $1,000 million - $1,030 million.  

PSEG Power  

PSEG Power reported Net Income of $610 million ($1.20 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus a Net Loss of $302 million ($0.59 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, PSEG Power reported Net Income of $479 million ($0.94 per share) versus Net Income for the full year 2016 of $18 million ($0.04 per share).  

PSEG Power reported non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $100 million ($0.20 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2017 and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $196 million bringing full year non-GAAP Operating Earnings to $505 million ($1.00 per share) and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to $1,172 million. On a comparative basis, PSEG Power reported non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $69 million ($0.13 per share) and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $155 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $514 million ($1.01 per share) and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $1,201 million for the full year 2016.  

Power’s fourth quarter Net Income includes a one-time, non-cash benefit of $588 million associated with a revaluation of deferred tax liabilities stemming from the reduction in the federal income tax rate to 21%. The company’s fourth quarter results also reflect an improvement in margins.  

An increase in capacity prices in New England and PJM improved quarterly Net Income comparisons by $0.02 per share. A 2% increase in generation output improved Net Income comparisons by $0.01 per share as higher gas send-out due to colder than normal weather improved quarterly Net Income comparisons by $0.01 per share. A decline in the average price received on energy hedges was partially offset by an increase in market prices on unhedged output resulting in a decline in quarter-over-quarter Net Income of $0.01 per share. A decline in O&M expense improved Net Income comparisons by $0.03 per share. A decline in depreciation, interest and taxes combined to improve fourth quarter Net Income comparisons by $0.01 per share.  

Output from Power’s generating facilities in the fourth quarter was 2% greater than output in the year-ago quarter. Quarterly comparisons were influenced by the timing of nuclear plant refueling outages and increased demand in response to colder than normal weather. For the year, based on results for the fourth quarter, output of 51 TWh was stronger than our forecast provided at the end of the third quarter, which called for full year output of 49 – 50 TWh. The nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 89.9% in the quarter, resulting in a full year capacity factor of 93.9%, and producing record electric output for the year of 31.8 TWh. Power’s gas-fired CCGT fleet operated at an average capacity factor of ~40% in the quarter resulting in a full-year capacity factor of ~47% producing 13.6 TWh of electric energy for the year. For the quarter, output from the coal fleet declined slightly as the result of outage work at the Keystone station. For the full year, output from the coal fleet increased 12% to 5.3 TWh as an increase in gas prices improved its competitiveness.  

Power is forecasting an improvement in output for 2018 to 55- 57 TWh. Following completion of the recent Basic Generation Service (BGS) auction in NJ, approximately 80% – 85% of production for the year is hedged at an average price of $40 per MWh. For 2019, Power has hedged 55% – 60% of forecast production of 59 – 61 TWh at an average price of $38 per MWh.  

 Power is forecasting a further increase in output for 2020 to 63 – 65 TWh. Approximately 25% - 30% of Power’s output in 2020 is hedged at an average price of $38 per MWh. The forecast of output for 2018 and 2019 has improved since our last forecast with an increase in spark spreads. The forecast for 2018 – 2020 includes generation associated with the mid-2018 commercial start-up of 1300 MWs of new, gas-fired combined cycle capacity at the Keys Energy Center in Maryland and Sewaren in New Jersey, and the mid-2019 commercial operation of the 485 MW gas-fired combined cycle generating unit in Bridgeport Harbor, Connecticut.  

For 2018, non-GAAP Operating Earnings and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA at PSEG Power are forecast to be $485 million - $560 million and $1,075 million - $1,180 million, respectively.  

PSEG Enterprise/Other  

PSEG Enterprise/Other reported Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $126 million ($0.25 per share) compared to Net Income of $11 million ($0.02 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year, PSEG Enterprise/Other reported Net Income of $122 million, ($0.24 per share) compared to a Net Loss in 2016 of $20 million ($0.04 per share). The results for 2017 include a one-time, non-cash earnings benefit of $147 million related to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate and a decrease in Energy Holdings’ deferred tax liabilities partially offset by an after-tax charge taken earlier in the year related to on-going challenges facing NRG REMA, LLC. The results for 2016 reflect after-tax charges for lease-related impairments.  

PSEG Enterprise/Other reported a non-GAAP operating loss in the fourth quarter 2017 of $21 million ($0.04 per share) compared to non-GAAP Operating Earnings of $17 million ($0.03 per share) in the year-ago quarter. The results for the fourth quarter brought PSEG Enterprise/Other non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the full year to $20 million ($0.03 per share) versus $72 million ($0.14 per share) in 2016.  

The decline in non-GAAP Operating Earnings year-over-year reflects the impact of a $15 million after-tax contribution to the PSEG Foundation as well as certain tax items at the Parent and PSEG Energy Holdings in fourth quarter of 2017 and the absence of certain tax items that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016 at Energy Holdings.  

For 2018, non-GAAP Operating Earnings for PSEG Enterprise/Other are forecast to be $35 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

Management uses non-GAAP Operating Earnings in its internal analysis, and in communications with investors and analysts, as a consistent measure for comparing PSEG’s financial performance to previous financial results. Non-GAAP Operating Earnings exclude the impact of returns (losses) associated with the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT), Mark-to-Market (MTM) accounting and material one-time items such as the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and the impact of the retirement of the Hudson and Mercer coal stations on Power.  

Management believes the presentation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for Power is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. Management also believes that non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure operating performance without regard to items such as income tax expense, interest expense and depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon, among other things, the book value of assets, capital structure and whether assets were constructed or acquired. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA also allows investors and other users to assess the underlying financial performance of our fleet before management’s decision to deploy capital. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our non-GAAP Operating Earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense and depreciation and amortization.  

See Attachment 12 for a complete list of items excluded from Net Income in the determination of non-GAAP Operating Earnings and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of non-GAAP Operating Earnings and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is intended to complement, and should not be considered an alternative to the presentation of Net Income, which is an indicator of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, non-GAAP Operating Earnings and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.  

Due to the forward looking nature of non-GAAP Operating Earnings and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA guidance, PSEG is unable to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management is unable to project certain reconciling items, in particular MTM and NDT gains (losses), for future periods due to market volatility.
