Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition 

On January 25, 2018, 3M Company issued a press release reporting fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 financial results and updating 2018 earnings outlook (previously furnished under Item 2.02 as Exhibit 99.1). One page of that press release is being furnished hereunder to correct certain information under the column titled “Full-Year 2018 Forecast (Billions)” of “Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure)” section in the “Supplemental Financial Information Non-GAAP Measures” table to reflect the expected impacts of the enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on 2018 full-year estimated free cash flow and net income attributable to 3M. This newly furnished page replaces the same page of the previously furnished press release. For ease of reference, the previously furnished relevant column (in bold) and the re-furnished column (in bold) are copied below:

(a) Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they function as useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash.
