Unum Group Reports Fourth Quarter 2017 Results

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (January 31, 2018) - Unum Group (NYSE: UNM) today reported net income of $266.9 million ($1.19 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net income of $248.0 million ($1.07 per diluted common share) for the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Included in net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 are impacts related to the U.S. tax reform bill enacted on December 22, 2017. The revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities at the newly enacted rate of 21 percent resulted in a tax benefit of $97.9 million ($0.44 per diluted common share), and the one-time tax on undistributed and previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits resulted in a tax expense of $66.4 million ($0.30 per diluted common share).

In addition, net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes a net loss of $25.4 million ($0.11 per diluted common share) related to the settlement of a third party review conducted on behalf of a number of state treasurers concerning unclaimed death benefits. The amount recognized reflects our estimate of the liability expected to be paid as we execute on the terms of the settlement.

Net after-tax realized investment gains on the Company’s investment portfolio were $7.2 million ($0.03 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $18.3 million ($0.08 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

After-tax adjusted operating income, which excludes net after-tax realized investment gains and losses, the impacts from tax legislation, and reserves established for unclaimed death benefits, was $253.6 million ($1.13 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $229.7 million ($0.99 per diluted common share) in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

“Our fourth quarter results were again strong, capping a very successful year for the company that surpassed our expectations,” said Richard P. McKenney, president and chief executive officer. “We’re pleased with our outstanding operating performance and the growth potential we have in front of us. As we move into 2018, we are focused on executing our business strategy to deliver growth, consistent performance, and shareholder value.”

RESULTS BY SEGMENT

We measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of "adjusted operating income" or "adjusted operating loss", which differ from income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and certain other items. These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for income before income tax or net income. Effective December 31, 2017, we changed the naming convention of "operating income" or "operating loss" to "adjusted operating income" or "adjusted operating loss." The definition of these labels remains unchanged.

Unum US Segment 

Unum US reported adjusted operating income of $237.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 1.0 percent from $240.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the before-tax unclaimed death benefits reserve increase of $26.6 million for the group life and accidental death and dismemberment and supplemental and voluntary product lines, adjusted operating income was $264.2 million, an increase of 10.0 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Premium income for the segment increased 3.0 percent to $1,364.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to premium income of $1,325.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported a 3.1 percent decline in adjusted operating income to $86.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $89.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Premium income in group disability increased 2.2 percent to $604.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $591.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to sales growth, partially offset by a decline in persistency. Net investment income declined by 4.7 percent to $113.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $118.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, due to a decrease in the level of invested assets and a decline in portfolio yield. The benefit ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 76.3 percent, compared to 77.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting continued favorable incidence trends in our group long-term disability product line. Group long-term disability sales were $126.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 17.2 percent from $107.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Group short-term disability sales were $97.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 57.8 percent from $61.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Persistency in the group long-term disability line of business was 89.9 percent for full year 2017, compared to 91.0 percent for full year 2016.

Excluding the before-tax unclaimed death benefits reserve increase of $18.5 million, adjusted operating income was $57.0 million, an increase of 1.6 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Premium income for this line of business increased 2.8 percent to $402.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017,

compared to $391.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to sales growth, partially offset by a decline in persistency. Net investment income declined 2.5 percent to $27.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $27.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to a decline in yield and a decline in the level of invested assets supporting this line of business. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 75.9 percent. Excluding the unclaimed death benefits reserve increase, the benefit ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 71.3 percent, compared to 71.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting lower incidence in the group life product line. Sales of group life and accidental death and dismemberment products increased 25.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $178.7 million, compared to $142.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Persistency in the group life line of business was 88.0 percent for full year 2017, compared to 90.7 percent for full year 2016. 

The supplemental and voluntary line of business reported an increase of 18.9 percent in adjusted operating income to $112.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $94.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the before-tax unclaimed death benefits reserve increase of $8.1 million for the voluntary life product line, adjusted operating income was $120.5 million, an increase of 27.5 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 is a reserve release of $19.5 million resulting from our annual review of reserve adequacy, which reflects the recognition of updated morbidity assumptions in our disabled life reserves. Premium income for supplemental and voluntary increased 4.5 percent to $356.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $341.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily driven by growth in the voluntary benefits and dental and vision product lines, offsetting a decline in premium income in the individual disability line. Net investment income increased 3.5 percent to $61.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $59.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, due to an increase in the level of invested assets and miscellaneous income, partially offset by a decline in yield. The benefit ratio for the individual disability product line was 34.4 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 54.7 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of the reserve release, the benefit ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 53.5 percent. The benefit ratio for voluntary benefits was 48.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the unclaimed death benefits reserve increase, the benefit ratio for voluntary benefits was 44.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 44.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily driven by stable claims experience. The benefit ratio for dental and vision was 64.6 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 65.9 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily driven by favorable claims experience. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2016, sales in the individual disability line of business increased 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $17.7 million. Sales in the voluntary benefits line of business increased 11.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $50.8 million. Sales in the dental and vision line totaled $24.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 148.0 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Persistency in the individual disability product line was 91.0 percent for full year 2017, compared to 91.1 percent for full year 2016. Persistency in the voluntary benefits product line was 77.5 percent for full year 2017, compared to 76.9 percent for full year 2016.

Unum UK Segment

Unum UK reported adjusted operating income of $29.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decline of 0.7 percent from $29.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In local currency, adjusted operating income declined by 7.1 percent to £22.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to £24.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Premium income increased by 9.4 percent to $133.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $121.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In local currency, premium income was £100.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 2.3 percent from £98.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily driven by growth in the in-force block, resulting from prior period sales which offset a decline in persistency. Net investment income was $31.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 10.8 percent from $28.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In local currency, net investment income was £24.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to £23.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to higher income from inflation index-linked bonds which support the claim reserves associated with certain group policies that provide inflation-linked increases in benefits and growth in the level of invested assets, partially offset by a decline in yield on fixed-rate bonds. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 75.8 percent, compared to 67.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting higher claim incidence in the group long-term disability product line and the impact from inflation-linked increases in benefits. Also contributing to the less favorable benefits experience was a reduction of 80 basis points in the discount rate implemented in the first quarter of 2017 across several of our products. 

Sales increased by 3.4 percent to $24.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $23.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In local currency, sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 declined by 3.7 percent to £18.4 million compared to £19.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Persistency in the group life line of business was 84.1 percent for full year 2017, compared to 81.3 percent for full year 2016. Persistency in the supplemental line of business was 91.0 percent for full year 2017 compared to 89.9 percent for full year 2016.

Colonial Life Segment 

Colonial Life reported a 16.5 percent decline in adjusted operating income to $66.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $79.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the before-tax unclaimed death benefits reserve increase of $12.4 million for the life product line, adjusted operating income was $79.1 million, a decrease of 1.0 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.

Premium income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 6.0 percent to $382.1 million, compared to $360.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by sales growth in recent quarters. Net investment income totaled $37.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $35.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily driven by an increase in the level of invested assets which was partially offset by a decline in portfolio yield. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 54.8 percent. Excluding the unclaimed death benefits

reserve increase, the benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 51.6 percent, compared to 51.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting less favorable benefits experience in the life product line, partially offset by favorable experience in the cancer and critical illness and accident, sickness, and disability lines of business.

Sales increased 10.4 percent to $199.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $181.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by increased sales in the core and large case commercial market segments. Persistency in Colonial Life was 78.9 percent for full year 2017 and 79.3 percent for full year 2016. 

Closed Block Segment

The Closed Block segment reported adjusted operating income of $33.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $34.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Premium income for this segment declined 4.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to expected policy terminations and maturities for the individual disability line of business which was partially offset by a slight increase in premium income for the long-term care line of business resulting from premium rate increases on certain in-force policies. Net investment income declined 0.6 percent to $341.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $343.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily driven by a decline in portfolio yield and lower miscellaneous income, which was partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the individual disability line of business declined to 81.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 84.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, due to favorable new claim incidence and a lower average size of new claim submissions. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the long-term care line of business was 93.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 89.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to unfavorable policy terminations related to mortality experience. 

Corporate Segment 

The Corporate segment reported an adjusted operating loss of $33.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $41.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement was primarily driven by lower operating expenses and higher net investment income.

The Company previously excluded the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses, a component of the net periodic benefit cost for the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans, from the results of the Corporate segment. Effective January 1, 2017, the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses is now reported in the Corporate segment and amounts for prior periods have been adjusted to conform to current year reporting.

Outlook 

Reflecting the beneficial impact of tax reform, the Company's expectation for after-tax adjusted operating income growth per share for full-year 2018 is revised to be within the range of 17 percent to 23 percent, compared to the original expectation of within a range of four percent to seven percent established in December 2017 prior to the passage of tax reform legislation. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measure of "after-tax adjusted operating income" differs from net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and certain other items as specified in the reconciliations in the Financial Highlights section below. We believe adjusted operating income is a better performance measure and better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business. 

Effective December 31, 2017, to more clearly differentiate between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, we changed the naming convention for our non-GAAP financial measures from “operating” to “adjusted operating” measures, which includes a change from "after-tax operating income" to "after-tax adjusted operating income." The definition of this label remains unchanged. 

Realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments. Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses. Although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities.

We previously excluded the amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses, a component of the net periodic benefit cost for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Effective January 1, 2017, the amortization of prior period 

UNUM IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK AND MARKETING BRAND OF UNUM GROUP AND ITS INSURING SUBSIDIARIES. 6

actuarial gains or losses is now included in "after-tax adjusted operating income" in the Financial Highlights section below. Amounts for periods prior to January 1, 2017 have been adjusted to conform to current year reporting. 

We have also excluded the impacts from tax legislation and reserves established for unclaimed death benefits and may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability.

Information reconciling the Company’s outlook on after-tax adjusted operating income growth per share to the comparable GAAP financial measure is not provided. The only amounts excluded from after-tax adjusted operating income are those described in the preceding paragraphs. The Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty realized investment gains and losses, which are affected by overall market conditions and also by factors such as an economic or political change in the country of the issuer, a regulatory change pertaining to the issuer’s industry, a significant improvement or deterioration in the cash flows of the issuer, unforeseen accounting irregularities or fraud committed by an issuer, movement in credit spreads, ratings upgrades or downgrades, a change in the issuer’s marketplace or business prospects, or any other event that significantly affects the issuers of the fixed maturity securities which the Company holds in its investment portfolio.
