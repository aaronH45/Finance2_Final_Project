Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure.

On January 4, 2018, The Western Union Company (the “Company”) issued a press release regarding the matters described under Item 8.01 below. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The information furnished under this Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act, except as may be expressly set forth by specific reference to such filing.

Item 8.01Other Events.

On January 4, 2018, the Company’s subsidiary, Western Union Financial Services, Inc. (“Western Union”), entered into a Consent Order (the “Consent Order”) with the New York Department of Financial Services (the “NYDFS”), which resolved an investigation by the NYDFS previously disclosed by the Company in its filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the Consent Order, Western Union is required, among other things, to pay to the NYDFS a civil monetary penalty in an aggregate amount of $60 million. The Company previously accrued $49 million towards resolution of this matter. The Consent Order also imposes certain non-monetary obligations, including a requirement to provide to the NYDFS a remediation plan within 90 days after the date of the Consent Order.

As previously disclosed by the Company, after the Company entered a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the “DPA”) on January 19, 2017, with the United States Department of Justice and the United States Attorney’s Offices for the Eastern and Middle Districts of Pennsylvania, the Central District of California, and the Southern District of Florida, the NYDFS opened an investigation into the facts set forth in the DPA and their connection to New York state. Also as previously disclosed by the Company, the NYDFS subsequently informed the Company of its position that the facts set forth in the DPA, which took place in the 2004 to 2012 period, gave the NYDFS a basis to take additional enforcement action under New York law, and the Company engaged in discussions with the NYDFS in an effort to resolve the matter. The Consent Order resolves those discussions and the NYDFS’s investigation.
