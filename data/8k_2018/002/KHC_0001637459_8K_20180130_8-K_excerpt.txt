Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

On January 30, 2018, Mackey McDonald informed the Company that he has decided not to stand for reelection to the Board of Directors at the Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “2018 Annual Meeting”). Mr. McDonald will continue to serve through the remainder of his current term. Mr. McDonald’s decision not to stand for re-election is not the result of any disagreement with management or the Board of Directors of Kraft Heinz related to our operations, policies or practices.  

The Board intends on keeping the same number of directors and will nominate George Zoghbi to stand for election at the 2018 Annual Meeting. Mr. Zoghbi served as the Chief Operating Officer of the U.S. Commercial business from the closing of the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz Company until October 2017 when he transitioned to Strategic Advisor, a role he will continue to hold. Mr. Zoghbi previously served as Kraft’s Chief Operating Officer since February 2015 and, before that, as Vice Chairman, Operations, R&D, Sales and Strategy since June 2014. He served as Executive Vice President and President, Cheese & Dairy and Exports from February 2013 until June 2014. Mr. Zoghbi served as Executive Vice President and President, Cheese and Dairy from October 1, 2012 to February 2013. Prior to that, he served as President, Cheese and Dairy of Mondelēz International, a global food and beverage company, since October 2009. Mr. Zoghbi is also a director of Brambles Limited, a global supply chain logistics company.  

A copy of the press release announcing Mr. McDonald’s retirement and Mr. Zoghbi’s nomination is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
