LONDON, United Kingdom — January 30, 2018 — Pentair plc (NYSE: PNR) today announced fourth quarter 2017 sales of $1.3 billion. Sales were up 6 percent compared to sales for the same period last year. Excluding currency translation and acquisitions, core sales grew 3 percent in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2017 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations ("EPS") were $1.11 compared to $0.60 in the fourth quarter of 2016. On an adjusted basis, the company reported EPS of $0.93 compared to $0.78 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Segment income, adjusted net income, free cash flow, and adjusted EPS are described in the attached schedules.

Fourth quarter 2017 operating income was $137 million, down 15 percent compared to operating income for the fourth quarter of 2016, and return on sales ("ROS") was 10.9 percent, a decrease of 270 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. On an adjusted basis, the company reported segment income of $227 million for the fourth quarter, up 11 percent compared to segment income for the fourth quarter of 2016, and ROS was 18.0 percent, an increase of 80 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.

Full year net cash provided by operating activities was $620 million and total free cash flow was $551 million. Full year net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $674 million and free cash flow from continuing operations was $611 million. The company delivered full year free cash flow of 94 percent of adjusted net income.

As a result of the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation, we recorded a provisional tax benefit of $85 million in the fourth quarter. This benefit is comprised of a $148 million benefit from the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liability offset by a $63 million charge for the deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. This charge is payable over the next eight years. Going forward, we now expect our effective tax rate to approximate 18%, which is an improvement over our current run rate of 20%.

Pentair paid dividends of $0.345 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Pentair previously announced on December 5, 2017 that its Board of Directors approved a 1 percent increase in the company's regular annual cash dividend rate for 2018 to $1.40 from $1.38. 2018 will mark the 42nd consecutive year that Pentair has increased its dividend.

"Pentair just concluded an exciting year that saw organic growth return, strong margin expansion, robust cash flow, and we announced that we plan to separate our Water and Electrical businesses into two publicly traded companies," said Randall J. Hogan, Pentair Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We had two goals for the year, which were to deliver on our 2017 commitments and prepare to stand up two companies in 2018. We believe that the momentum we showed exiting the year reinforces that we made great progress toward both of our goals. We remain excited for Pentair's next chapter as we create two industry-leading pure-play companies in Water and Electrical."
