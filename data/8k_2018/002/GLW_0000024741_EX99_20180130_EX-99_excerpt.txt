 ﻿  

 “Strong growth and strong investment made 2017 an outstanding year. We exited the year running at full capacity in several of our businesses and with committed customer demand that supports our current capacity-expansion initiatives. We expect to see the benefits of these initiatives in the second half of 2018 and beyond as production ramps,” said Wendell P. Weeks, chairman, chief executive officer, and president. “2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy & Capital Allocation Framework. We feel great about our progress and prospects.”  

 ﻿  

 Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework Progress  

 ﻿  

 “We’re proud of our 2017 performance,” Weeks continued. “But it’s important to recognize that our achievements are not just the result of strong execution this year. Our success stems from the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework that we introduced more than two years ago, and its focus on what’s best for Corning and its stakeholders.”  

 ﻿  

 The Framework outlines the company’s 2016-2019 leadership priorities. Under the Framework, Corning plans to deliver more than $12.5 billion to shareholders while investing $10 billion in growth opportunities. Since it was announced in October 2015, the company has achieved key milestones including the return of $9 billion to shareholders through dividends, which have increased 29%, and share repurchases, which have reduced outstanding shares by 30%.

 “The strategic and financial benefits of Corning’s focused portfolio are increasingly evident as we enter the third year under our Framework,” Weeks said. “We’re particularly pleased with significant achievements across our market-access platforms.”   

 ﻿  

 Highlights of progress in Corning’s market-access platforms include: a major contract with Verizon for next generation networks, and two significant acquisitions in Optical Communications; initiating shipment of the world’s first Gen 10.5 glass and capturing opportunities for Corning® Iris™ Glass in Display; celebrating the 10th anniversary of Corning® Gorilla® Glass with new applications and more glass on devices in Mobile Consumer Electronics; winning the majority of awarded platforms for gas particulate filters and advancing Gorilla Glass for Automotive to 35 platform wins; and introducing Valor™ Glass, a revolutionary new pharmaceutical packaging solution, and related manufacturing capacity plans in Life Sciences Vessels.   

 ﻿  

 “In 2018, we will continue to advance the objectives of our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework,” Weeks added. “Our results and outlook confirm that we have the right strategy in place to achieve the goals of our Framework and drive consistent growth.”

 Segment Results and Outlook   

 Display Technologies:   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 NOTE: In all segments except the Display Technologies segment, core net sales are consistent with GAAP net sales. Because a significant portion of sales and costs in the Display Technologies segment are denominated in Japanese yen and South Korean won, this segment’s net sales and costs are adjusted to remove the impact of translating yen and won into U.S. dollars.

 Page Three  

 ﻿  

 Full-year core sales in Display Technologies were $3.4 billion, and core earnings were $944 million. For the full-year, volume was up mid-single digit percentages, in line with our expectations. Pricing improved as anticipated, and reached single-digit percentage declines year over year in both the third and fourth quarters of 2017.   

 ﻿  

 Fourth-quarter core sales were $847 million, and core earnings were $221 million. In the fourth quarter, volume was up slightly sequentially, in line with the market.  

 ﻿  

 For full-year 2018, Corning expects LCD glass market growth to be in the mid-single digit percentages, similar to 2017, as screen size growth continues. The company expects Corning’s volume to grow faster than the market as Corning supports the ramp-up of the world’s first Gen 10.5 fab. The improvements in LCD glass pricing are expected to continue in 2018, with full-year price declines expected to reach the mid-single digit percentages.   

 ﻿  

  Optical Communications:   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Optical Communications had a very strong year, with full-year 2017 sales of $3.5 billion, up 18%, and core earnings up 33%. Sales growth in both enterprise and carrier businesses, as well as contributions from acquisitions, drove the outstanding results. Fourth-quarter sales increased 13% year over year.  

 2018 full-year Optical Communications sales are expected to increase by about 10%, excluding any contribution from the pending acquisition of 3M’s Communications Markets Division.  

 ﻿  

 Environmental Technologies:   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 In Environmental Technologies, 2017 sales, including the first sales of gas particulate filters, were $1.1 billion, up 7%, driven by worldwide auto market growth and new business wins. Core earnings were $139 million, as capacity and engineering investments partially offset the benefits of sales growth. Fourth-quarter sales grew 19% year over year, with core earnings up 33%.   

 ﻿  

 For 2018, Environmental Technologies sales are expected to increase by a high-single digit percentage.

 Specialty Materials:  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Specialty Materials 2017 sales rose 25%, led by the increasing adoption of glass on the backs of devices. Fourth-quarter sales were up 17% year over year.

 ﻿  

 Life Sciences:   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 In Life Sciences, full-year 2017 sales were up 5% and fourth-quarter sales were up 9% year over year, as the business continued to outpace market growth. For full-year 2018, sales are expected to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage.

 Presentation of Information in this News Release  

 Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning’s non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the company’s operations. The company believes presenting non-GAAP financial measures assists in analyzing financial performance without the impact of items that may obscure trends in the company’s underlying performance. Detailed reconciliations outlining the differences between these non-GAAP measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found on the company’s website by going to the Investor Relations page and clicking “Financial Highlights” under the “Performance” tab. These reconciliations also accompany this news release.

 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

 ﻿  

 CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES  

 In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we supplement certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements with measures adjusted to exclude certain items, to arrive at core performance measures. We believe that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions. Corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for the Japanese yen and South Korean won, and uses an internally derived yen-to-dollar management rate of ¥99 and won-to-dollar management rate of ₩1,100. The Company believes that the use of constant currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations, and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contract used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our net sales and net income.   

 ﻿  

 Net sales, equity in earnings of affiliated companies and net income are adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in the Japanese yen and the South Korean won, gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates. Management’s discussion and analysis on our reportable segments has also been adjusted for these items, as appropriate. These measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”). We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures. With respect to the Company’s outlooks for future periods, it is not able to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast the movement of the Japanese yen and South Korean won against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control. As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.  

 ﻿  

 See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for details on core performance measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” below.
