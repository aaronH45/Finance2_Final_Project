Item 8.01 Other Events. 

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation) was enacted. The Tax Legislation is complex and materially changes U.S. corporate income tax rates. Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the Company) estimates that the Tax Legislation will result in an unfavorable impact of $320 million in its fourth quarter earnings and will be an ongoing benefit to the Company’s earnings and cash flow generation. 

· The charge is primarily related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets using the lowered corporate tax rate, repatriation tax and lower future tax benefits from low income housing assets. This is a one-time, primarily non-cash, accounting adjustment. 

· The Company’s estimate is that the ongoing effective tax rate will be in the 17 to 19 percent range over the near term. The lower corporate tax rate will have an ongoing benefit to earnings and the Company expects to earn back the initial charge within two years. 

The Company also expects fourth quarter 2017 results will include approximately $25 million after-tax net catastrophe losses from its auto and home insurance business, nearly all of which is attributable to California wildfires.
