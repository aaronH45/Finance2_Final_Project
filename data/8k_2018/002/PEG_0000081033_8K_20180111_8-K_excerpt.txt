The information contained in Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure in this combined Form 8-K is separately furnished, as noted, by Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG), Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G) and PSEG Power LLC (Power). Information contained herein relating to any individual company is provided by such company on its own behalf and in connection with its respective Form 8-K. PSE&G and Power each makes representations only as to itself and makes no other representations whatsoever as to any other company.  

 Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure  

In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was enacted, which made significant changes to U.S. tax law. In particular, under the Act, the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate will decrease from a maximum of 35% to 21% and certain changes were made to bonus depreciation rules. The rate reduction took effect on January 1, 2018.  

For the year ended December 31, 2017, PSEG will be required to assess the impact of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, which requires that the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates be recognized in the period the tax rate change was enacted. PSEG, based on currently available information, expects the enacted reduction in the statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate, as well as other aspects of the Act, will have the following material impacts on its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017:  

   •   PSEG expects to record a one-time, non-cash earnings benefit in the range of $660 million to $850 million.  

   •   Approximately $530 million to $650 million of this non-cash earnings benefit is expected to relate to the impact of the Act on Power.  

   •   Approximately $130 million to $180 million of this non-cash earnings benefit is expected to relate to the impact of the Act on the accounting for the leveraged lease portfolio managed by PSEG Energy Holdings, L.L.C.  

   •   PSE&G expects to have excess deferred taxes in the range of $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion. PSE&G records the revenue impact of excess deferred taxes as regulatory liabilities where it is probable that refunds will be made to customers in future rates. However, the amount and timing of any such refund cannot be determined at this time.  

Beginning in 2018, PSEG, on a consolidated basis, will incur lower income tax expense resulting in a decrease in its projected effective income tax rate. This is also expected to increase PSEG’s and Power’s net income. Power’s operating cash flows will reflect the full expensing of capital investments for income tax purposes. PSEG and Power expect that the interest on their debt will continue to be fully tax deductible albeit at a lower tax rate. For PSE&G, the Act is expected to lead to lower customer rates over time due to lower income tax expense recoveries and the refund of deferred income tax regulatory liabilities, partially offset by the impacts of higher rate base. The impact of the lower federal income tax rate on PSE&G will be reflected in PSE&G’s upcoming distribution base rate case filing and its Transmission formula rate filings. The Act is generally expected to result in lower operating cash flows for PSE&G resulting from the elimination of bonus depreciation, partially offset by higher revenues due to the higher rate base. The full impact of these and other provisions of the Act cannot be determined at this time.  

The impact of the Act may differ from these estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions PSEG has made, guidance that may be issued and actions PSEG may take as a result of the Act. PSEG will continue to assess the expected impacts of the Act and will include its estimated impacts and additional details in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
