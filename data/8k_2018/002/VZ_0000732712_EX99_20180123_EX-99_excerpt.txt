NEW YORK - Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) closed 2017 with another quarter of strong Verizon Wireless customer growth and retention, and with core and emerging businesses positioned for 2018 and beyond. 

 “Verizon finished 2017 with great momentum, led by some of the best customer growth and loyalty results Verizon Wireless has delivered in recent years,” said Chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam. “In 2018 we look to drive long-term shareholder value by deploying next-generation network services, leveraging global platforms such as Oath, and using our strategic Humanability approach to turn innovative ideas into realities.”

Tax-reform legislation will have a positive impact to cash flow from operations in 2018 of approximately $3.5 billion to $4 billion. The incremental cash flow will be used primarily to strengthen Verizon’s balance sheet. Additionally, Verizon will announce later today how employees will further share

in the company’s success, and the company will also be increasing contributions to the Verizon Foundation by $200 million to $300 million over the next two years. These two initiatives have a projected EPS impact of 5 to 6 cents for each of the next two years.

For fourth-quarter 2017, Verizon reported EPS of $4.56, compared with $1.10 in fourth-quarter 2016. On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), fourth-quarter 2017 EPS was 86 cents, compared with 86 cents in fourth-quarter 2016.

Fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted EPS included a net pre-tax loss from special items of about $2.6 billion: a severance and mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB (other post-employment benefits) liabilities of $1.2 billion dollars; early debt redemption costs of $681 million; a $671 million charge for product realignment of early-stage developmental technologies; acquisition and integration-related charges of $154 million; and a non-cash pre-tax gain on spectrum license transactions of about $144 million. As Verizon noted in an 8-K filing on Jan. 17, the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also resulted in a one-time, after-tax increase to earnings provisionally estimated to be approximately $16.8 billion, or $4.10 per share. This is primarily related to the re-measurement of the company’s net deferred tax liabilities at the new corporate income tax rate. 

The cumulative net impact from these items, after tax, was approximately $15.2 billion, or $3.71 per share, in fourth-quarter 2017.

For full-year 2017, Verizon reported $7.36 in EPS, compared with $3.21 in full-year 2016. On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), 2017 EPS was $3.74, compared with 2016 EPS of $3.87.

Consolidated results

Total consolidated operating revenues in fourth-quarter 2017 were $34.0 billion, up 5.0 percent from fourth-quarter 2016. Full-year 2017 consolidated operating revenues were $126.0 billion. On a comparable basis excluding divestitures and acquisitions (non-GAAP), full-year consolidated revenues declined approximately 2 percent in 2017, compared with 2016.

Net income was $18.8 billion in fourth-quarter 2017. EBITDA (non-GAAP, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) totaled approximately $9.2 billion. Consolidated operating income margin was 14.1 percent. Consolidated EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) was 27.2 percent in fourth-

quarter 2017, compared with 37.1 percent in fourth-quarter 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) for 2017 was 35.7 percent and 35.5 percent in the same periods, respectively.

Cash flow from operations totaled $25.3 billion in 2017, and capital expenditures totaled $17.2 billion. In 2017, Verizon made $9.5 billion in cash dividend payments to shareholders.

In Verizon’s media business, Oath revenues were $2.2 billion in fourth-quarter 2017, up approximately 10 percent from third-quarter 2017, driven by increased customer advertising spending during the holidays. Verizon expects a normal seasonal trend in Oath revenues between fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018.

In telematics, revenues were more than $230 million in fourth-quarter 2017. IoT (Internet of Things) revenues increased approximately 17 percent year over year, and 8 percent on an organic basis (non-GAAP).

•Total retail postpaid churn was 1.00 percent in fourth-quarter 2017, a year-over-year improvement of 10 basis points, driven mainly by retail postpaid phone churn of 0.77 percent. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of retail postpaid phone churn of less than 0.90 percent.

•Total revenues were $23.8 billion in fourth-quarter 2017, an increase of 1.7 percent compared with fourth-quarter 2016 and the company’s first year-over-year wireless revenue growth in two years.

For full-year 2017, total revenues totaled $87.5 billion, a decline of 1.9 percent.

Outlook and guidance

For 2018, Verizon expects the following:

•Full-year consolidated revenues will grow at low-single-digit percentage rates on a GAAP basis. Excluding the impact from the new revenue recognition standard, Verizon is on track to achieve year-over-year wireless service revenue growth by the middle part of 2018. On a GAAP basis, Verizon expects service revenue growth to turn positive around the end of 2018 or early 2019.

•Low single-digit percentage growth in adjusted EPS, which includes the dilutive impacts from a full year of depreciation and amortization costs from 2017 acquisitions, the Straight Path acquisition expected to close later in the first quarter, and the ongoing impact of last year’s data center divestitures. This is before the impact of tax reform and the revenue recognition standard. 

•Capital spending for 2018 will be in the range of $17.0 billion to $17.8 billion, including the commercial launch of 5G.

•The expected savings from tax reform will generate a net $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion uplift to cash flow from operations in 2018. This is expected to yield a 55 to 65 cent increase in 2018 EPS, net of impacts from the employee and Verizon Foundation initiatives. The resulting 2018 effective tax rate is projected to be in the range of 24 to 26 percent.
