Ameren Announces 2017 Results 

and Issues Guidance[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•2017 Core EPS Exclude Non-Cash Charges for Federal and State Income Tax Law Changes

•2018 Diluted EPS Guidance Range Established at $2.95 to $3.15

•Expect Diluted EPS to Grow at 5% to 7% Compound Annual Rate through 2022, Based on 2017 Core EPS

ST. LOUIS (Feb. 16, 2018) — Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced 2017 net income attributable to common shareholders in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $523 million, or $2.14 per diluted share, compared to $653 million, or $2.68 per diluted share, for 2016. The 2017 GAAP earnings included non-cash charges, primarily at the parent company, that decreased earnings by a combined $168 million, or 69 cents per diluted share, reflecting the revaluation of deferred taxes as a result of changes in Illinois and federal income tax rates. Excluding these charges, Ameren recorded 2017 core earnings of $691 million, or $2.83 per diluted share. There were no differences between GAAP and core earnings for 2016.

The year-over-year increase in 2017 core earnings reflected new Ameren Missouri electric service rates effective April 1, 2017, which were driven, in part, by increased infrastructure investments and removal of the negative effect of lower sales to the New Madrid aluminum smelter. In addition, the comparison benefited from earnings on increased infrastructure investments made at Ameren Transmission and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. These favorable factors were partially offset by lower electric retail sales, primarily driven by milder summer temperatures. The earnings comparison was also unfavorably impacted by the absence of a 2016 performance incentive award related to Ameren Missouri's 2013 through 2015 energy efficiency plan, as well as higher Ameren Missouri depreciation expense.

"In 2017, we again delivered strong core earnings growth," said Warner L. Baxter, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. “Our team continued to successfully execute our strategy across our businesses, including allocating capital to jurisdictions with modern, constructive regulatory frameworks and managing costs in a disciplined manner. In addition, Ameren Missouri announced a forward-thinking plan under 

Page 1 of 6

which it expects to accelerate its transition to a cleaner, more diversified energy portfolio, including significant investments in renewable generation by 2020."

Ameren recorded a GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, of $60 million, or 24 cents per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $32 million, or 13 cents per diluted share, for the same period in 2016. The GAAP results for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, included a $154 million, or 63 cents per diluted share, charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from a change in the federal income tax rate. Excluding this charge, Ameren recorded core earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, of $94 million, or 39 cents per diluted share. 

The year-over-year increase in fourth quarter 2017 core earnings reflected a change in the timing of interim period revenue recognition at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution that increased results by 12 cents per diluted share but had no effect on full-year earnings. The comparison also benefited from new Ameren Missouri electric service rates, increased infrastructure investments made at Ameren Transmission and a lower effective income tax rate. These favorable factors were partially offset by a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center in the fourth quarter that increased operations and maintenance expenses, compared to the year-ago period when there was no such outage. 

As reflected in the table below, the following items were excluded from core earnings:

•A non-cash charge, at the parent company, for the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from a July 2017 change in Illinois law that increased the state's corporate income tax rate, which decreased 2017 earnings by $14 million.

•A non-cash charge, primarily at the parent company, for the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from a Dec. 2017 change in federal law that decreased the federal corporate income tax rate, which decreased fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings by $154 million. 

A reconciliation of three-month and full-year GAAP to core earnings in millions of dollars and per share, is as follows:

Earnings Guidance

Ameren expects diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.95 to $3.15 for 2018 and to grow at a 5% to 7% compound annual rate from 2017 through 2022, using 2017 core results as a base. This multi-year earnings growth is expected to be driven by projected rate base growth of approximately 7% compounded annually from 2017 through 2022, which does not include approximately $1 billion of wind generation investment proposed by Ameren Missouri in its September 2017 Integrated Resource Plan filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission. 

"Looking ahead, we plan to continue to deliver strong long-term earnings per share growth reflecting a robust pipeline of investments in critical energy infrastructure that will deliver long-term benefits to our customers and the communities we serve," Baxter said. "In addition, our customers will ultimately realize significant benefits associated with the recent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate. Increased investments in critical energy infrastructure coupled with utility rate benefits associated with tax reform result in a win-win for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders." 

Earnings guidance for 2018 assumes normal temperatures and, along with Ameren's growth expectations, is subject to the effects of, among other things: 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields; regulatory, judicial and legislative actions; energy center and energy distribution operations; energy, economic, capital and credit market conditions; severe storms; unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses; and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release.

Ameren Missouri Segment Results

Ameren Missouri 2017 GAAP and core earnings were $323 million and $359 million, respectively, compared to 2016 earnings of $357 million. GAAP earnings in 2017 included a $36 million non-cash charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from a change in the federal income tax rate, but this charge was excluded from core earnings. The increase in year-over-year core earnings reflected new electric service rates that were largely offset by lower electric retail sales primarily driven by milder summer temperatures, the absence of a 2016 performance incentive award, as well as higher depreciation and transmission expenses. 

Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution Segment Results

Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution 2017 earnings were $131 million, compared to 2016 earnings of $126 million. The year-over-year earnings improvement was primarily driven by earnings on increased infrastructure investments, as well as a higher allowed return on equity due to a higher average 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield in 2017 compared to 2016. These favorable factors were partially offset by the absence of the 2016 benefit from warmer-than-normal temperatures before the decoupling of electric revenues began in 2017. 

Ameren Illinois Natural Gas Segment Results

Ameren Illinois Natural Gas 2017 earnings of $60 million were comparable to 2016 earnings of $59 million. 

Page 3 of 6

Ameren Transmission Segment Results

Ameren Transmission 2017 earnings were $140 million, compared to 2016 earnings of $117 million. The year-over-year earnings improvement reflected increased infrastructure investments partially offset by a lower allowed return on equity. 

Other Results (includes items not reported in a business segment)

Other results for 2017 were a GAAP loss of $131 million and core earnings of $1 million, respectively, compared to a 2016 loss of $6 million. The 2017 GAAP loss included non-cash charges that decreased earnings by a combined $132 million reflecting the revaluation of deferred taxes as a result of changes in Illinois and federal income tax rates, but these charges were excluded from core results. The improvement in year-over-year core results primarily reflected a decrease in the effective income tax rate.

Analyst Conference Call

Ameren will conduct a conference call for financial analysts at 9 a.m. Central Time on Friday, Feb. 16, to discuss 2017 earnings, earnings guidance and other matters. Investors, the news media and the public may listen to a live broadcast of the call at AmerenInvestors.com by clicking on "Webcast" under "Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call," where an accompanying slide presentation will also be available.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In this release, Ameren has presented core earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. A reconciliation of GAAP information to non-GAAP information has been included in this release. Generally, core earnings or losses include earnings or losses attributable to common shareholders and exclude income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as the third quarter 2017 non-cash charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from a July 2017 change in Illinois law that increased the state's corporate income tax rate and the fourth quarter 2017 non-cash charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from a December 2017 change in federal law that decreased the federal corporate income tax rate. Ameren uses core earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core earnings as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the company believes that core earnings allow the company to more accurately compare its ongoing performance across periods. In providing core earnings guidance, there could be differences between core earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP as a result of our treatment of certain items, such as that described above. Ameren is unable to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of such future items.
