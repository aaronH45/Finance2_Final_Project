Expects to Increase Investments in Growth, Including a New U.S. Manufacturing Plant  

Announces 2018 Guidance  

Additional $10 Billion of Share Repurchases Authorized  

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (Feb. 1, 2018) – Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Key results include:  

   •    

For the fourth quarter, total revenues decreased 3 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2016 to $5.8 billion. For the full year, total revenues decreased 1 percent to $22.8 billion.  

   •    

GAAP loss per share of $5.89 for the fourth quarter and GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $2.69 for the full year include a $6.1 billion charge related to impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform.  

   •    

Non-GAAP EPS were flat in the fourth quarter at $2.89. Non-GAAP EPS increased 8 percent for the full year to $12.58, driven by higher operating margins and interest income and a lower share count.  

   •    

Free cash flow for the full year grew 9 percent to $10.5 billion, driven by higher operating income and favorable changes in working capital. At year end, cash and investments totaled $41.7 billion.  

   •    

The Company expects to increase investments to drive additional volume-driven growth of novel medicines in large patient populations. These plans include a new U.S. manufacturing plant.  

   •    

Cash returned to shareholders totaled $6.5 billion in 2017 through dividends and share repurchases. The Company’s Board of Directors authorized an additional $10 billion of share repurchases.

Additional Capital Investments in the United States  

The Company expects to invest approximately $3.5 billion in capital expenditures over the next five years, with approximately 75 percent of that investment in the U.S., up from about 50 percent in recent years. This investment includes committing up to $300 million to build a new manufacturing plant in the U.S. The new facility will employ Amgen’s proven next-generation biomanufacturing capabilities, and manufacture products for the U.S. and export markets. Next-generation biomanufacturing requires less time and capital investment to build than a traditional biomanufacturing plant and is less costly to operate, with less environmental impact. The construction and validation work is expected to add 220 jobs to the local economy. In addition, Amgen expects this new facility to employ up to 300 highly skilled full-time employees. Amgen expects to finalize the exact location in the second quarter. The Company is also increasing the size of the Amgen Ventures fund, providing up to $300 million of growth capital for early-stage, innovative biotechnology companies in the U.S.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In this news release, management has presented its operating results for the fourth quarters and full years of 2017 and 2016, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and on a non-GAAP basis. In addition, management has presented its full year 2018 EPS and tax rate guidance in accordance with GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are computed by excluding certain items related to acquisitions, restructuring and certain other items, including the repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings and other impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform, from the related GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the news release. Management has also presented Free Cash Flow (FCF), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the fourth quarters and full years of 2017 and 2016. FCF is computed by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow, each as determined in accordance with GAAP.  

The Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects for the future of the Company’s ongoing business activities by facilitating comparisons of results of ongoing business operations among current, past and future periods. The Company believes that FCF provides a further measure of the Company’s liquidity.  

The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures set forth in the news release in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets. The non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements  

This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  

AMGEN REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS  

 Page 12  

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data security. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations 

(In millions, except per share data)

The following table presents the computations for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  

The adjustments related primarily to non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (c)  

For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, the adjustments related primarily to severance expenses associated with our restructuring initiative. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, the adjustments related primarily to asset-related charges associated with our site closures.  

 (d)  

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the adjustment included net charges associated with the discontinuance of the internal development of AMG 899.  

 (e)  

The tax effect of the adjustments between our GAAP and non-GAAP results takes into account the tax treatment and related tax rate(s) that apply to each adjustment in the applicable tax jurisdiction(s). Generally, this results in a tax impact at the U.S. marginal tax rate for certain adjustments, including the majority of amortization of intangible assets, whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including restructuring expense, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions. Due to these factors, the effective tax rates for the adjustments to our GAAP income before income taxes, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, were 31.6% and 31.9%, respectively, compared with 30.2% and 31.8% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.  

 (f)  

For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, the adjustments related primarily to the impact of U.S. Corporate tax reform, including the repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of certain net deferred and other tax liabilities. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, the adjustments related to certain acquisition items and prior period items excluded from GAAP earnings.  

 (g)  

During periods of net loss, diluted loss per share is equal to basic loss per share as the anti-dilutive effect of potential common shares is disregarded.
