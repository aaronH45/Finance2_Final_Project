Sweeping change accompanied record performance at General Motors in 2017. To continue focusing resources on its most pro table franchises, GM sold its Opel/ Vauxhall and GM Financial European operations, and exited South and East Africa, and India. The company reduced U.S. inventories to align supply with demand, while preparing for its all-new full-size pickups, and completed the refresh of its crossover portfolio by launching the Chevrolet Traverse and Equinox, Buick Enclave and GMC Terrain. To advance its vision of a zero emissions world, GM laid out plans to introduce at least 20 new all-electric vehicles that will launch by 2023. The company also recently led a Safety Petition asking the U.S. Department of Transportation to allow GM to safely deploy its fourth-gen self-driving Cruise AV on public roads. This vehicle eliminates the steering wheel, pedals and other unnecessary manual controls. GM expects to deploy self driving vehicles in a ride sharing environment in 2019. In January, GM forecasted its full-year 2018 to be largely in line with 2017’s record performance, building on previous records in 2016 and 2015. The introduction of its all-new full-size pickups later this year is expected to help accelerate earnings in 2019. On a consolidated basis (including discontinued operations), GM reported a 2017 net loss of $3.9 billion, driven primarily by charges totaling $13.5 billion. These included a $7.3-billion non-cash charge related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to U.S. tax reform, and a largely non-cash charge of $6.2 billion resulting from the sale of Opel/ Vauxhall.

EBIT-adjusted was a record for a fourth quarter. This result was driven by sales of GM’s latest crossovers, along with strong pricing and cost control — which more than oset a wholesale volume decline during the quarter. Fourth-quarter income (loss) of $(4.9) billion includes a non-cash charge of $7.3 billion related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to U.S. tax reform. Fourth-quarter 2016 income was $1.9 billion. FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS EBIT-adj. Margin EBIT-adj. Adj. Auto FCF EPS Diluted-adj. Non-GAAP 8.2% $3.1 B $4.2 B $1.65 Vs.

Through December 31, 2017, GM sold 8.9 million vehicles globally, an increase of 0.8 percent from 2016, and grew market share in each of its three key markets. In the United States, GM sold 3 million vehicles, including record sales of crossovers and pickup trucks, helping the company earn record average transaction prices, according to J.D. Power PIN estimates. GM and its joint ventures sold 4 million vehicles in China for the first time. The record sales were anchored by Baojun and Buick, along with Cadillac, which posted a sales increase of 51 percent. In South America, Chevy posted a 13.8-percent sales increase. Global deliveries of electric vehicles were a record 69,500, led by record deliveries of Chevrolet Bolt EV (26,000) and Baojun E100 (11,500). For more details, click here. In 2018, GM will continue its product momentum with the introduction of its all-new full-size trucks — the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. These important vehicles will round out the widest- ranging truck portfolio in the industry. The 2019 Chevrolet Silverado expands its customer appeal signicantly, featuring eight distinct models to serve the “high value,” “high feature” and “high volume” segments of the market. This year, GM will gain the benet of a full year of volume from the ongoing launches of its newest crossovers, the Chevrolet Traverse, Buick Enclave and GMC Terrain. The company will also introduce the next all-new Cadillac — the XT4 crossover — which will make its global debut this year. After introducing six new or refreshed models in the fourth quarter in China, GM and its JV partners will launch 15 more in 2018, under the Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet, Baojun and Wuling brands. GM returned $6.7 billion to shareholders in 2017 through share buybacks of $4.5 billion and dividends of $2.2 billion. Since 2012, GM has returned more than $25 billion, which represents more than 90 percent of available free cash flow generated over that time. GM’s 2017 year-end globalautomotive pension underfunded position was $14.1 bi l l ion, an improvement from $18.2 billion at the end of 2016 which includes the pension liabilities assumed by PSA in connection with the sale of Opel/Vauxhall. The funded status of the company’s $68.5 billion 2017 year-end U.S. defined-benefit pension plan obligation improved to about 92-percent, up from approximately 90 percent in 2016, as plan assets grew to $62.6 billion from $61.6 billion.
