        "* Under U.S. GAAP, the accounting for a net loss from continuing operations results in the presentation of dilutive earnings per share equal to basic earnings per share, as any increase in basic shares would be anti-dilutive to earnings per share. As a result of the highlighted items identified during Q4 2017, the Company reported a net loss from continuing operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 within our GAAP Consolidated Statement of Operations, while reporting income on a non-GAAP basis over the same periods. An adjustment is reflected to correct for the dilution of 7.2 million dilutive shares outstanding in Q4 2017 and 6.4 million dilutive shares outstanding for the full-year 2017."
