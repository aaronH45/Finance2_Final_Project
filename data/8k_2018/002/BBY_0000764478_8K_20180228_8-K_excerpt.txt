Item 2.05Costs Associated With Exit or Disposal Activities.

On February 28, 2018, Best Buy Co., Inc. ("Best Buy") announced that it intends to close all of its 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the United States by May 31, 2018. This decision is the result of changing economics in the mobile industry since Best Buy began opening these stores in 2006, along with the integration of its mobile model into its core stores and on-line channel, which are today more economically compelling.

The costs of implementing these changes primarily consist of costs related to termination of store leases. Best Buy expects to incur total pre-tax restructuring charges in the range of $55 to $65 million, which equates to diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.14 to $0.17. Best Buy expects that the majority of these charges will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The expected total charges include between $53 and $63 million of cash payments - primarily related to the termination of store leases - that will be paid over the next year.
