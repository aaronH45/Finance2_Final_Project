Item 8.01 Other Events

Retail Rate Case

As previously disclosed, on August 18, 2017, the Arizona Corporation Commission (“ACC”) issued a final written Opinion and Order (the “Order”) reflecting its decision in Arizona Public Service Company’s (“APS”) general retail rate case. (See Note 3 of the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation/APS Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 for details of the rate case and the Order.) 

On Wednesday, January 3, 2018, an APS customer filed a petition with the ACC that was determined by the ACC Staff to be a complaint filed pursuant to Arizona Revised Statute §40-246 (the “Complaint”) and not a request for rehearing. This statute requires the Commission to hold a hearing regarding any complaint alleging that a public service corporation is in violation of any commission order if the complaint is signed by at least twenty-five customers of the public service corporation. The Complaint alleges that APS is “in violation of commission order” [sic]. APS will have twenty days to respond to the Complaint once it is formally served, which has not yet occurred. APS expects a hearing officer will be assigned to hear the Complaint, and it is uncertain as to the timing and procedure under which the Complaint will ultimately be considered. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

SIGNATURES
