LAKE FOREST, Ill., Feb. 21, 2018 - Stericycle, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRCL) today reported results for the fourth quarter and the full-year ended December 31, 2017. The Company also provided additional details on its Business Transformation, which is expected to deliver $850 million to $1 billion of cumulative Adjusted EBITDA* benefits over the next five years.

BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND PILLARS OF SUCCESS 

Stericycle today provided additional details regarding its Business Transformation, which the Company began executing during the fourth quarter of 2017, to improve long-term operational and financial performance. As part of the Business Transformation, Stericycle plans to build a best-in-class EPM operating model to enable the Company to operate more efficiently, provide an enhanced experience to customers, better capitalize on future growth opportunities, and establish greater controls and oversight to drive more consistent results. Additionally, a key component of the Business Transformation is the implementation of an ERP system, which will leverage standard  

1 

processes throughout the organization to accelerate decision making, expedite acquisition integration, remediate compliance and control issues, and enable real-time analytics. For further information, see the accompanying Transformation Overview at http://investors.stericycle.com. 

Key initiatives of the Business Transformation include: 

•  

Portfolio Rationalization: Executing on a comprehensive review of the Company’s global service lines to identify and pursue the divestiture of non-strategic assets. 

•  

Operational Optimization: Standardizing route planning logistics, modernizing field operations, and driving network efficiency across facilities. 

•  

Organizational Excellence and Efficiency: Redesigning the Company’s organizational structure to optimize resources and align around a global shared business services model. 

•  

Commercial Excellence: Aligning our sales and service organizations around the customer, standardizing our customer relationship management processes, and expanding customer self-service options. 

•  

Strategic Sourcing: Reducing spend through global procure-to-pay processes and leveraging organizational scale. 

Transformation initiatives, inclusive of the implementation of best-in-class systems, are expected to deliver Adjusted EBITDA between 2018 and 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 9%* and an Adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate of 6% to 10%*. Over this same period, the Company projects that it will generate a substantial amount of free cash flow, equivalent to a compound annual growth rate of 10% to 14%*. Stericycle expects to record approximately $275 to $300 million in adjusting items and capital expenditures associated with the Business Transformation over five years, with those investments delivering an anticipated internal rate of return greater than 85%.

EPS decreased 87.0% to $0.27 from $2.08 last year, due primarily to the impact of the previously announced Settlement and certain non-recurring litigation matters of $2.38, a $0.79 non-cash goodwill impairment charge in Latin America, and $0.23 of Business Transformation related expenses, partially offset by favorable impact of $1.52 from U.S. tax reform.

“Our Business Transformation is expected to deliver significant financial benefits to Stericycle shareholders, including $850 million to $1 billion cumulative Adjusted EBITDA* benefit and Adjusted EBITDA* margin improvement at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 9% between 2018 and 2022,” said Daniel V. Ginnetti, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “We have made significant progress repaying our outstanding debt and continue to execute a disciplined capital deployment plan. In all, we believe the incremental benefits of the Business Transformation combined with our strong cash flow generation will provide the Company with numerous levers for additional value creation.” 

U.S. CORPORATE TAX REFORM COMMENTARY 

With the newly approved U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Company recorded a provisional amount of $129.8 million as an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017. This provisional amount is based on a benefit of $167.7 million for the expected reversal of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in accordance with the corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21%, less a one-time transition tax of $24.3 million on remitted foreign earnings and profits and $13.6 million of expected foreign withholding taxes. 

“The benefit of recently-enacted U.S. tax reform legislation will provide additional cash flow that we intend to utilize in support of our capital allocation priorities,” said Ginnetti. 

* The Company is unable to forecast the comparable long-range U.S. GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty and related unpredictability of non-recurring adjusted items exclusive of the Business Transformation investments referenced above.

 (a) The Non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release are reconciled to the most comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the schedules attached to this release. Management believes the Non-GAAP financial measures represent the amounts directly related to the ongoing operations of the business and uses these measures in evaluating performance. All Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable U.S. GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation from, or a replacement for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to, or calculated in the same manner as Non-GAAP financial measures published by other companies. 

(b) Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax and Amortization (Adjusted EBITA) is Income from operations excluding specified items, inclusive of Intangible Amortization. 

(c) Under the Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholder column, adjustments are shown net of tax in aggregate of $46.5 million and $28.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, based on applying either the statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the adjustment occurred or, by adjusting the tax effect to consider the impact of applying an annual effective tax rate on an interim basis.
