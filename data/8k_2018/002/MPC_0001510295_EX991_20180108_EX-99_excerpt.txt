Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow (DCF} and distribution coverage ratio are non-GAAP financial measures provided in this presentation. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash-flow reconciliations to the nearest GAAP financial measures are included in the Appendix to this presentation. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio are not defined by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income attributable to MPC or MPLX, net cash provided by operating activities or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Distribution coverage ratio is the ratio of DCF attributable to GP and LP unitholders to total GP and LP distributions declared. Light Product Breakeven is a metric used in this presentation and defined on the slides where it is used. The EBITDA forecasts related to certain projects were determined on an EBITDA-only basis. Accordingly, information related to the elements of net income, including tax and interest, are not available and, therefore, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest GAAP financial measures have not been provided.

34 2017 Citizenship Report Issued This year marks Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s 130th year of providing the most affordable, reliable and plentiful energy the world has ever known. Our diversification into the natural gas business through our logistics partnership, MPLX LP, positions us well for a future in which the world’s need for energy continues to grow. Petroleum and natural gas are the energy sources that make modern life possible, and we are proud to play a prominent role in bringing them to the world. But reports like this annual Citizenship Report and our Perspectives on Climate- Related Scenarios – published this year and available on our website – are critical to truly understanding the choices we’re making. Transparency about how we manage the risks in our business can bring society closer to making informed decisions about a future of abundant energy, a clean and safe environment, and prosperity for as much of mankind as possible. Our manufacturing processes are cleaner and safer than ever. At the same time, as the world’s energy needs rise, alternative energy sources like wind and solar are often portrayed as virtually free of trade-offs. It’s fortunate, then, that the World Bank has studied the matter and pointed out in a report this year that wind, solar and other energy technologies routinely called “clean,” are actually “significantly MORE material intensive in their composition than current traditional fossil-fuel- based energy supply systems.” Excerpts from opening comments from Gary R. Heminger, chairman and chief executive officer Available on marathonpetroleum.com under Corporate Citizenship tab

Excerpts from opening comments from Gary R. Heminger, chairman and chief executive officer and Introduction section We believe the disclosures made in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our annual Citizenship Report and this report are aligned with the main principles outlined in the recommendations of the TCFD and demonstrate MPC’s resilience to potential climate-related risks. With this report, we have enhanced our disclosures respecting our governance, risk management, strategy and metrics related to the subject of climate change. We are also including the results of a stress-test of our business against the International Energy Agency’s (IEA's) hypothetical 450 Scenario and New Policies Scenario.

It is basically the ratio of the process investment downstream of the crude unit to the investment of the crude unit itself. This index has many limitations as an indicator of value and is not necessarily a useful tool in predicting profitability. There is no consideration for operating, maintenance or energy efficiencies and no consideration of non-process assets such as tanks, docks, etc. Likewise it does not consider the ability to take advantage of market related feedstock opportunities.
