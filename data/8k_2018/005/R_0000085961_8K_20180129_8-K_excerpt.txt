Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) (the “Tax Act”) into law. The many changes in the Tax Act include a permanent reduction in the maximum federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective as of January 1, 2018.

Based on its preliminary analysis of the Tax Act, including the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate, Ryder System, Inc. (the “Company”) estimates that it will record a net one-time benefit from the Tax Act of approximately $586 million or $11.04 per diluted share in the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The net benefit is due to the estimated impact of the change in future tax rates on the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by the Company’s provisional reasonable estimate of a one-time tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings. The resulting net tax benefit will be excluded from the Company's comparable earnings from continuing operations (non-GAAP) reported in the Company's fourth quarter earnings release expected to be filed on February 16, 2018.

In connection with the anticipated benefit of the Tax Act, the Company awarded a one-time cash bonus, estimated to be approximately $23 million or $0.27 per diluted share, to all non-incentive bonus eligible employees of the Company employed on December 31, 2017. The bonus will be paid to eligible employees in February 2018. The bonus will be excluded from the Company's comparable earnings from continuing operations (non-GAAP) reported in the Company's fourth quarter earnings release scheduled for February 16, 2018. 

This disclosure herein is related only to the estimated impact of the Tax Act on the Company’s operating results for fourth quarter of 2017. The Tax Act is expected to result in a reduction of the Company’s effective income tax rate in 2018. The Company will continue to analyze the full effects of the Tax Act, including the new lower corporate tax rate, on its financial results and operations and will provide more guidance in its fourth quarter earnings release and Form 10-K expected to be filed on February 16, 2018.

The information in this Report is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and General Instruction B.2 thereunder and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except as expressly set forth by specific reference to such filing.
