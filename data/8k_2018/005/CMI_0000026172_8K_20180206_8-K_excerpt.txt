BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Our consolidated financial statements were prepared based on proposed guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in their Exposure Draft (ED) released on January 18, 2018, regarding the reclassification of certain stranded effects of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The ED was not final on our earnings release date of February 6, 2018, but is expected to be final when we file our 2017 Form 10-K the week of February 12, 2018. 

EQUITY, ROYALTY AND INTEREST INCOME FROM INVESTEES

Equity, royalty and interest income from investees included in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the reporting periods was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 ___________________________________________________________

(1) U.S. tax legislation passed in December 2017 decreased our equity earnings at certain equity investees, including a $7 million unfavorable impact to Cummins Westport, Inc. due to the remeasurement of deferred taxes and a $32 million unfavorable impact to "All other manufacturers" due to withholding tax adjustments on foreign earnings.

INCOME TAXES

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation). Among other things, the Tax Legislation changed the U.S. statutory rate to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. The impact of the Tax Legislation resulted in a net incremental charge to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income of $777 million. The components of the 2017 charge were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The $781 million increase in tax expense is composed of three elements - the remeasurement of deferred taxes, a one-time transitional tax on unrepatriated earnings and withholding taxes on foreign earnings. 

We remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21 percent. We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Legislation and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances. The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance is an incremental tax expense of $152 million.

The one-time transition tax is based on our total post-1986 unrepatriated earnings and profits not previously subject to U.S. income tax. The recorded provisional amount for our one-time transition tax is a tax expense of $298 million.

Withholding tax is an additional cost associated with the distribution of earnings from some jurisdictions. As a result of the Tax Legislation, we reconsidered previous assertions regarding earnings that were considered permanently reinvested, which requires us to record withholding taxes on earnings likely to be distributed in the foreseeable future. The assertion as to which earnings are permanently reinvested for purposes of calculating withholding tax is provisional as we refine the underlying calculations of the amount of earnings subject to the tax and the rate at which it will be taxed. The recorded provisional amount for the withholding tax resulted in an incremental tax expense of $331 million.

Our unconsolidated equity investees were also unfavorably impacted by the new tax legislation by $39 million, due to $32 million of withholding taxes on foreign earnings and $7 million due to the remeasurement of deferred taxes. In addition, our noncontrolling interests included a $43 million credit related to the withholding taxes on foreign earnings. 

Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate, primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was 151.8 percent and 58.0 percent for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively,  compared to 22.0 percent and 24.6 percent for the fourth quarter and full year in 2016. Our 2017 effective tax rate excluding the Tax Legislation was 19.5 percent and 24.5 percent for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively.

We expect our 2018 effective tax rate to be 23 percent, excluding any discrete items (including adjustments to provisional estimates) that may arise.

Reconciliation of Non GAAP measures - Earnings before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interests

We define EBIT as earnings before interest expense, income tax expense and noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries. We use EBIT to assess and measure the performance of our operating segments and also as a component in measuring our variable compensation programs. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. It should be considered supplemental data. Below is a reconciliation of “Net income attributable to Cummins Inc.” to EBIT for each of the applicable periods:

We will use EBITDA to assess and measure the performance of our operating segments and also as a component in measuring our variable compensation programs beginning January 1, 2018. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

Component Segment Sales by Business

In the first quarter of 2017, our Components segment reorganized its reporting structure to move our electronics business out of the emission solutions business and into the fuel systems business to enhance operational, administrative and product development efficiencies. Prior year sales were reclassified to conform with this change. We renamed our fuel systems business to electronics and fuel systems.

In the third quarter of 2017, we formed the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies joint venture (ECJV), which was consolidated and included in our Components segment as the automated transmissions business.
