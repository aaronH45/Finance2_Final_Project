•Free cash flow was $564 million

“We had another good year in 2017 as we continued to execute against the long-term growth and capital allocation strategies that we established in 2015,” said Allman. “Our Plumbing Products segment achieved another year of top- and bottom-line growth, and our Decorative Architectural Products segment continued to grow its successful pro paint initiative. Cabinetry Products grew its KraftMaid® brand in the repair and remodel market, and late in the fourth quarter, we began setting a new retail program with our Cardell® cabinetry brand. I am also pleased with the progress we made in our Windows and Other Specialty Products segment, as we delivered a $54 million improvement in adjusted operating profit in 2017. Lastly, we continued our commitment to deploy capital to create shareholder value by increasing our dividend for the fourth year in a row, repurchasing $331 million in shares, and committing approximately $640 million to acquisitions.”

“As we look towards 2018, we believe we are well positioned to drive profitable growth and create shareholder value by continuing to execute on our strategies,” continued Allman. “The fundamentals of our industry remain strong, and with the momentum we have across our segments, the anticipated benefits of the recent tax reform legislation, and the expected accretion of our two acquisitions, we anticipate our adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.48 to $2.63 for 2018.”
