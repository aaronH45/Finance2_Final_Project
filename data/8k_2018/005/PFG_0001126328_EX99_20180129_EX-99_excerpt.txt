(Des Moines, Iowa) – Principal Financial Group® (Nasdaq: PFG) today announced results for fourth quarter and full year 2017.

•Net income attributable to PFG for fourth quarter 2017 of $841.8 million, compared to $318.0 million for fourth quarter 2016. Net income per diluted share of $2.87 for fourth quarter 2017 compared to $1.09 in prior year quarter. For the 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2017, net income attributable to PFG of $2,310.4 million, or $7.88 per diluted share, up 75 percent compared to $1,316.5 million, or $4.50 per diluted share, for the 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2016. Net Income in the fourth quarter 2017 benefited from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law in December 2017. The net financial impacts were reflected in Other After-Tax Adjustments and were excluded from non-GAAP operating earnings. The impact included:

◦A $625.6 million benefit from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability using the lower corporate tax rate;

◦A $43.1 million one-time deemed repatriation tax expense on foreign earnings; and

◦A $14.2 million reduced tax benefit of foreign dividends paid and lower future tax benefits from investments.

____________________________________ 

1 Use of non-GAAP financial measures is discussed in this release after segment results. Non-GAAP operating earnings for total company is after tax. To comply with recent SEC guidance on non-GAAP financial measures, our “operating earnings” label has changed to “non-GAAP operating earnings” on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis at the total company level. The calculation of these measures has not changed. 

•Non-GAAP operating earnings for fourth quarter 2017 of $350.8 million, compared to $372.0 million for fourth quarter 2016. Non-GAAP operating earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $1.19 for fourth quarter 2017 compared to $1.27 for fourth quarter 2016. For the 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2017, record non-GAAP operating earnings of $1,478.6 million, or $5.04 per diluted share, up 11 percent compared to $1,331.1 million, or $4.55 per diluted share, for the 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2016. 

•Quarterly common stock dividend of $0.51 per share for first quarter 2018 was authorized by the company’s Board of Directors, bringing the trailing twelve-month dividend to $1.93 per share, a 15 percent increase compared to the prior year trailing twelve-month period. The dividend will be payable on Mar. 29, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Mar. 5, 2018.

“2017 was a very good year for Principal,” said Dan Houston, chairman, president and CEO. “We had record net income for the year; and record non-GAAP operating earnings, despite the fourth quarter decline. We also increased AUM by $77 billion, or 13 percent, in 2017, to $669 billion at year-end, creating solid momentum going into 2018.”

“Throughout the year, we continued to deliver strong investment performance, to expand our solution set, and enhance relationships with customers and distributors,” Houston added. “We again balanced investments in growth with disciplined expense management. We committed $180 million to strategic acquisitions in 2017; and we distributed more than $730 million to shareholders through common stock dividends and share buybacks, reflecting our balanced approach to capital deployment and our ongoing commitment to creating long-term value for our shareholders.” 

Other highlights

•Principal Global Investors (PGI) ended the quarter with record AUM of $430.9 billion. Pre-tax return on operating revenues less pass-through commissions2 increased to 37.0 percent on a trailing twelve month basis, a 30 basis point increase from a year ago.

____________________________________ 

2 The company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the end of the release. The company has determined this measure is more representative of underlying operating revenues growth for PGI as it removes commissions that are collected through fee revenue and passed through expenses with no impact to pre-tax operating earnings.

3 Premium and fees = premiums and other considerations plus fees and other revenues.

Full-Year 2017

•Strong Morningstar investment performance4, with 76 percent of Principal’s investment options above median on a one-year basis, 69 percent on a three-year basis and 83 percent on a five-year basis.

•In Retirement and Income Solutions-Spread, full year pension risk transfer sales were a record $2.8 billion.

•Principal International reported record combined5 net revenues (at PFG share) of $922.0 million in 2017, an increase of 16 percent over 2016.

•U.S. Insurance Solutions sales were a record at $560.0 million, up 6 percent over prior year. 

•Deployed $913.0 million of capital. This included: 

◦$540.0 million of common stock dividends, including the $0.49 per share common dividend paid in the fourth quarter; 

◦$193.0 million to repurchase 3.1 million shares of common stock; and

◦$180.0 million in acquisitions and increased ownership in PGI boutiques.

•Strong capital position with estimated statutory risk-based capital (RBC) ratio for Principal Life Insurance Company of 445 percent at year-end, above our 415-425 targeted range. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had an immaterial impact on our estimated RBC ratio at year-end. Our goal remains to bring the RBC ratio back to our targeted range over the next several quarters through strategic capital deployment.

Segment Results

Retirement and Income Solutions - Fee

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Pre-tax operating earnings increased $2.6 million driven by an increase in net revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses.

•Net revenue increased $11.5 million. The increase reflects higher fees in the current quarter driven by growth in account values, partially offset by higher net investment income in the year ago quarter.

Excludes Money Market, Stable Value, Liability Driven Investment (Short, Intermediate and Extended Duration), Hedge Fund Separate Account & US Property Separate Account.

5 Combined basis = all Principal International companies at 100 percent. The company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the end of the release. The company has determined combined net revenue (at PFG share) is more representative of underlying net revenue growth for Principal International as it reflects our proportionate share of consolidated and equity method subsidiaries. In addition, using this net revenue metric provides a more meaningful representation of our profit margins.

Certain statements made by the company which are not historical facts may be considered forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements as to non-GAAP operating earnings, net income available to common stockholders, net cash flows, realized and unrealized gains and losses, capital and liquidity positions, sales and earnings trends, and management’s beliefs, expectations, goals and opinions. The company does not undertake to update these statements, which are based on a number of assumptions concerning future conditions that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Future events and their effects on the company may not be those anticipated, and actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. The risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause or contribute to such material differences are discussed in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, and in the company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2017, filed by the company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as updated or supplemented from time to time in subsequent filings. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect the company’s ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital; conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally; volatility or declines in the equity, bond or real estate markets; changes in interest rates or credit spreads or a sustained low interest rate environment; the company’s investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of its invested assets and the investment returns credited to customers; the company’s valuation of investments and the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on such investments may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations; any impairments of or valuation allowances against the company’s deferred tax assets; the company’s actual experience could differ significantly from its pricing and reserving assumptions; the pattern of amortizing the company’s DAC and other actuarial balances on its universal life-type insurance contracts, participating life insurance policies and certain investment contracts may change; changes in laws, regulations or accounting standards; the company may not be able to protect its intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims; the company’s ability to pay stockholder dividends and meet its obligations may be constrained by the limitations on dividends Iowa insurance laws impose on Principal Life; litigation and regulatory investigations; from time to time the company may become subject to tax audits, tax litigation or similar proceedings, and as a result it may owe additional taxes, interest and penalties in amounts that may be material; applicable laws and the company’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that some stockholders might consider in their best interests; competition, including from companies that may have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and stronger financial performance; a downgrade in the company’s financial strength or credit ratings; client terminations, withdrawals or changes in investor preferences; inability to attract and retain qualified employees and sales representatives and develop new distribution sources; an interruption in telecommunication, information technology or other systems, or a failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data residing on such systems; international business risks; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the company may need to fund deficiencies in its “Closed Block” assets; the company’s reinsurers could default on their obligations or increase their rates; risks arising from acquisitions of businesses; and loss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect information of our customers or employees. 

Use of Non-GAAP financial measures

The company uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors because they illustrate the performance of normal, ongoing operations, which is important in understanding and evaluating the company’s financial condition and results of operations. They are not, however, a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures. Therefore, the company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the end of the release. The company adjusts U.S. GAAP measures for items not directly related to ongoing operations. However, it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in 

future reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP measures for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation, and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts.

Summary of Principal Financial Group, Inc. and Segment Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*U.S. GAAP (GAAP) net income attributable to PFG versus non-GAAP operating earnings

Management uses non-GAAP operating earnings, which is a financial measure that excludes the effect of net realized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other after-tax adjustments the company believes are not indicative of overall operating trends, for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation, and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts. Note: it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. While these items may be significant components in understanding and assessing our consolidated financial performance, management believes the presentation of non-GAAP operating earnings enhances the understanding of results of operations by highlighting earnings attributable to the normal, ongoing operations of the company’s businesses.
