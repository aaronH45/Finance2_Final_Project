Item 5.03Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

On January 18, 2018, the Registrant’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) resolved to amend the Registrant’s Restated By-laws (the “By-laws”) to implement proxy access. 

Section 1.10 has been added to the By-laws to allow a stockholder or a group of no more than 20 stockholders that has maintained continuous ownership of 3% or more of the Registrant’s common stock for at least three years to include in the Registrant’s proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders a number of director nominees up to the greater of two or 20% of the Board, provided that the stockholder(s) and the stockholder nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the By-laws. Additionally, due to the addition of the proxy access bylaw, the Board approved certain changes to Section 1.08 that are not substantive in nature, as reflected in the full text of the By-laws. 

The foregoing description of the changes effected by the amendment to the By-laws is qualified by reference to the full text of the By-laws, as so amended, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 3.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Item 8.01Other Events.

The Registrant makes various grants of restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and stock options to its executive officers and other management employees pursuant to its 2014 Tiffany & Co. Employee Incentive Plan (the “2014 Employee Incentive Plan”). As part of its ongoing review of compensation practices and arrangements, on January 17, 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board adopted revised restricted stock unit, performance-based restricted stock unit and stock option grant terms under the 2014 Employee Incentive Plan.
