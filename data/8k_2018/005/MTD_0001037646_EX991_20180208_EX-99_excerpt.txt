While the Company has provided an outlook for Adjusted EPS, it has not provided an outlook for EPS as it would require an estimate of non-recurring items, which are not yet known. The Company noted in making its outlook that economic uncertainty remains in certain regions of the world and market conditions are subject to change.

Filliol concluded, "Diligent execution of our strategic initiatives, supported by favorable economic conditions in all major regions of the world, resulted in excellent operating results in 2017. We believe we are well positioned for further share gains with the benefit of our Spinnaker sales and marketing initiatives, excellent product pipeline, additional investments in sales resources and further use of sophisticated tools such as big data analytics to identify growth opportunities in our markets.
