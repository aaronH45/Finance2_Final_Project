U.S. Dollar Notes Offering  

On March 1, 2018, Becton, Dickinson and Company (the “Company” or “BD”) issued $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due December 29, 2020 (the “Notes”) in an underwritten public offering pursuant to the indenture, dated March 1, 1997, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Indenture”). 

The Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, from time to time, on the first business day after the date that is one year following the date of issuance of the Notes or at any time or from time to time thereafter at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. 

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Notes), each holder of outstanding Notes will have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of that holder’s Notes (in integral multiples of $1,000) at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the rights of holders of such Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, unless the Company has earlier exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described above. 

Each of the following constitutes an event of default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes: (1) failure to pay any installment of interest on the Notes when due and payable, continued for 30 days; (2) failure to pay the principal when due of the Notes, whether at stated maturity or otherwise; (3) failure to observe or perform any other covenants, conditions or agreements of the Company with respect to the Notes for 60 days after the Company receives notice of such failure; or (4) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization. If an event of default occurs, the principal amount of the Notes may be accelerated pursuant to the Indenture. 

The Indenture includes requirements that must be met if the Company consolidates or merges with, or sells all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to, another entity. The Indenture also contains certain restrictive covenants, including a limitation on liens and a restriction on sale and leasebacks. 

The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Indenture, a copy of which is incorporated by reference from Exhibit 4(a) to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 31, 1997, and the Notes, a form of which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
