DOWNERS GROVE, Ill., January 30, 2018 — Dover (NYSE: DOV), a diversified global manufacturer, announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results:

For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, Dover's revenue was $2.0 billion, an increase of 13% from the prior year. The increase in the quarter was driven by organic growth of 8%, acquisition growth of 6% and a favorable impact from foreign exchange ("FX") of 2%, partially offset by a 3% impact from dispositions. Net earnings were $296.4 million, an increase of 84% as compared to $161.2 million for the prior year period. Diluted net earnings per share ("EPS") for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, were $1.88, compared to $1.03 EPS in the prior year period, representing an increase of 83%. 

For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, EPS included a $0.32 net benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a $0.70 net benefit from a disposition and a $0.03 benefit from a reduction to a previously recorded product recall reserve. Fourth quarter 2017 EPS also included rightsizing and other costs of $0.25 and Wellsite separation related costs of $0.05. Excluding these aforementioned benefits and costs, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $1.13, an increase of 49% over an adjusted EPS of $0.76 in the prior year period. 

For the year ended December 31, 2017, Dover's revenue was $7.8 billion, an increase of 15% from the prior year. This increase includes organic growth of 8%, acquisition growth of 10%, partially offset by a 3% impact from dispositions. The impact of FX was negligible. Net earnings were $811.7 million, an increase of 59% as compared to $508.9 million for the prior year period. EPS for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $5.15, compared to $3.25 EPS in the prior year period, representing an increase of 58%. 

For the year ended December 31, 2017, EPS included a $0.32 net benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a $1.07 net benefit from dispositions and a $0.03 benefit from a reduction to a previously recorded product recall reserve. Full year 2017 EPS also included rightsizing and other costs of $0.25 and Wellsite separation related costs of $0.06. Excluding these aforementioned benefits and costs, adjusted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $4.03, an increase of 39% over a comparably adjusted EPS of $2.90 for full year 2016. 

A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is included as an exhibit herein.

Impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:

In the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, Dover recorded a net benefit of $50.9 million, or $0.32 EPS relating to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This benefit was primarily derived from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities, offset in part, by the recognition of a U.S. tax charge for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. On a go-forward basis, Dover anticipates its effective tax rate will be 22% to 23%, 4 to 5 points lower than its prior effective rate, principally as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

2018 Guidance: 

Beginning in 2018, Dover will provide adjusted EPS guidance and results that will exclude after-tax acquisition-related amortization. The Company believes reporting adjusted EPS on this basis better reflects its core operating results, offers more transparency and facilitates easier comparability with peer companies. 

A full reconciliation between forecasted GAAP and forecasted adjusted measures, reflecting adjustments for aforementioned acquisition-related amortization as well as carryover rightsizing costs, is included as an exhibit herein.

In 2018, Dover expects to generate adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.73 to $5.93, representing an increase of 19% over the prior year on a comparable basis. This guidance is based on full year revenue growth of 3% to 5%, and is comprised of organic growth of 5% to 7% and a favorable impact from FX of 1%, partially offset by a 3% impact from dispositions. The impact of completed acquisitions is expected to be negligible.

Dover’s guidance for 2018 includes full year Wellsite operating performance, but does not include any costs related to the Wellsite separation, which will be reported as incurred. 

Wellsite Separation Update:

Dover announced on December 7, 2017, that it expects to spin off, on a tax-free basis, the upstream energy businesses within its Energy segment, collectively, the “Wellsite” business. Wellsite includes Dover Artificial Lift, Dover Energy Automation, and US Synthetic, and operates in some of the most attractive segments of the oil & gas drilling and production industry. Dover expects to complete the spin-off of Wellsite in May of 2018.

For the full year ended December 31, 2017, Wellsite’s revenue was $1.0 billion, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) were $242 million, excluding costs related to rightsizing and Wellsite separation. For full year 2018, Wellsite is expected to generate revenue growth of approximately 16%, and EBITDA of approximately $315 million, before public company costs, estimated to be approximately $35 million.

Completion of the transaction is subject to certain customary conditions, including, among others, assurance that the spin-off of Wellsite will be tax-free to Dover and U.S. shareholders, the effectiveness of appropriate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and final approval by Dover's Board of Directors.

Management Commentary:

Dover’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert A. Livingston, said, “Our fourth quarter performance reflects strong global markets which drove broad-based revenue growth. Volume gains, combined with our cost and productivity actions, resulted in significant adjusted margin improvement. We had particularly strong growth in our waste handling, food equipment and pumps businesses, as well as in our Wellsite business. In all, our team’s strong execution delivered a solid quarter, while at the same time making significant progress on the Wellsite spin-off, rightsizing and several other commercial initiatives.

“During 2017, we continued to make strides simplifying our portfolio and increasing our focus on the markets where we have built very strong positions. We also expanded adjusted margin more than 150 basis points, and we are on track to our three-year plan.

“With respect to 2018, our guidance reflects the continued execution of our strategy. We expect broad-based organic growth and another year of margin expansion in excess of 100 basis points. Further, as part of our disciplined capital allocation plan, we expect to deploy capital towards highly synergistic, margin accretive bolt-on acquisitions, while at the same time investing in the businesses we own, completing our planned $1 billion share repurchase and raising our dividend for the 62nd consecutive year.”

Dover will host a webcast and conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results and 2018 guidance at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time (9:00 A.M. Central Time) on Tuesday, January 30, 2018. The webcast can be accessed on the Dover website at dovercorporation.com. The conference call will also be made available for replay on the website.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2017

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

Acquisitions

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed two acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of $10.3 million. For the full year 2017, the Company acquired three businesses in separate transactions for total consideration of $43.1 million, net of cash acquired and including contingent consideration. The businesses were acquired to complement and expand upon existing operations within the Engineered Systems and Energy segments.

Disposed Businesses

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed the sale of the consumer and industrial winch business of Warn Industries, Inc. a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of high performance vehicle equipment and accessories for total proceeds of $250.3 million and a pre-tax gain on sale of $116.9 million. For the full year 2017, the Company also completed the sale of Performance Motorsports International, a manufacturer of pistons and other engine related components serving the motorsports and powersports markets, during the first quarter for total proceeds of $118,706 and a pre-tax gain on sale of $88.4 million. These disposals were within the Engineered System segment and did not represent strategic shifts in business and, therefore, did not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation. 

Rightsizing and Other Costs

During the fourth quarter, the Company, as previously announced, recorded rightsizing and other related costs of $56.3 million to better align its cost structure in preparation for the Wellsite separation. The $56.3 million is comprised of $45.8 million of restructuring costs and $10.5 million of other charges. These costs relate to actions taken on employee reductions, facility consolidations and site closures and product line divestitures and exits. These charges were broad based across all segments as well as corporate, with costs incurred of $9.2 million in Engineered Systems, $8.2 million in Fluids, $15.3 million in Refrigeration & Food Equipment, $7.3 million in Energy and $16.3 million at Corporate. 

Tax Rate

The effective tax rate was a benefit of 8.3% and a provision of 25.4% for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. On a full year basis, the effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 were 16.7% and 26.2%, respectively. The 2017 rates were significantly impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that resulted in revaluing the U.S. deferred income tax liabilities due to the decrease in the U.S. statutory rate from 35% to 21%, offset by the U.S. tax charge for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. The 2016 rates were favorably impacted by the settlement of uncertain tax positions.

Share Repurchases

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company purchased approximately 1.1 million shares of its common stock in the open market at a total cost of $105.0 million, or $99.11 per share. These repurchases were made pursuant to the share repurchase program approved in January 2015, which authorized $15 billion for share repurchases over the following three years. That program is now expired and the Company expects approval of a new share repurchase authorization in the first quarter of 2018.

Non-GAAP Disclosures

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, Management also discloses non-GAAP information that Management believes provides useful information to investors. Adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per common share, net debt, net capitalization, net debt to net capitalization ratio, adjusted free cash flow, and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net earnings, diluted earnings per common share, debt or equity, cash flows from operating activities, or revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

Adjusted net earnings represents net earnings adjusted for the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, gains on disposition of businesses, disposition costs, Wellsite separation costs, rightsizing and other costs, and a product recall reserve charge and reversal. We exclude these items because they occur for reasons that may be unrelated to the Company's commercial performance during the period and/or Management believes they are not indicative of the Company's ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period. Management believes this information is useful to investors to better understand the company’s ongoing profitability and facilitates easier comparisons of the company’s profitability to prior and future periods and to its peers. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share represents adjusted net earnings divided by average diluted shares. Beginning in 2018, adjusted net earnings will further exclude after-tax acquisition-related amortization because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. Management believes excluding after-tax acquisition-related amortization will better reflect the Company's core operating results, offer more transparency and facilitate easier comparability with peer companies. 

Net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders' equity. Management believes the net debt to net capitalization ratio is useful to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity. 

Adjusted free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures, plus the add back of cash taxes paid for gains on dispositions and cash paid for the Wellsite separation costs. Management believes that adjusted free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities, such as funding acquisitions, paying dividends, repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock. 

Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods.

This press release includes Wellsite's projected pro forma EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization before public company expenses, a measure that is not defined under GAAP. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most closely comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is not available without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of certain information needed to calculate certain reconciling items, including interest expense and income tax expense.
