Full Year 2018 Guidance: The company has reaffirmed its 2018 full year organic growth guidance. Full year net sales are expected to be $10.52 billion - $10.69 billion, implying organic sales growth of 5.0% to 7.0%. Foreign currencies are expected to increase sales by $170 million, due to the appreciation of the Euro and Chinese Yuan. The acquisition of Sevcon will increase sales by approximately $45 million. Net earnings are expected to be within a range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share, with the increase in guidance primarily due to a lower tax rate assumption and larger benefit from foreign currencies. Excluding the impact of non-comparable items, operating margin is expected to be in the range of 12.6%-12.7%.

First Quarter 2018 Guidance: The company has reaffirmed its 2018 first quarter organic growth guidance. The company expects organic net sales growth of 3.0% to 5.5%, compared with first quarter 2017 net sales of $2.41 billion. Foreign currencies are expected to increase sales by $100 million. The acquisition of Sevcon will increase sales by approximately $15 million. Net earnings are expected to be within a range of $0.99 to $1.03 per diluted share, with the increase in guidance primarily due to a lower tax rate assumption and larger benefit from foreign currencies. 

Financial Results: Net sales were $2,586 million in fourth quarter 2017, up 14.5% from $2,259 million in fourth quarter 2016. Net loss in the quarter was $(146) million, or $(0.70) per basic share, compared with a net loss of $(293) million, or $(1.39) per basic share, in fourth quarter 2016. Net loss in fourth quarter 2017 included non-comparable items of $(1.76) per diluted share. Net loss in the fourth quarter 2016 included net non-comparable items of $(2.23) per diluted share. These items are listed in a table below, which is provided by the company for comparison with other results and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. The impact of foreign currencies increased net sales by approximately $103 million and increased net earnings by approximately $0.03 per diluted share in fourth quarter 2017 compared with fourth quarter 2016.

These items are listed in a table below as reconciliations of non-U.S. GAAP measures, which are provided by the company for comparison with other results, and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. The impact of foreign currencies increased net sales by approximately $55 million and decreased net earnings by approximately $0.01 per diluted share in 2017 compared with 2016.

Non-core Emission Product Update: In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company launched an active program to locate a buyer for the non-core pipes and thermostat product lines and initiated all other actions required to complete the plan to sell the non-core product lines. The Company determined that the assets and liabilities of the pipes and thermostat product lines met the held for sale criteria as of December 31, 2017. As a result, the Company recorded an asset impairment expense of $71.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to adjust the net book value of this business to fair value less costs to sell. The Company also recorded restructuring expense of $35.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily related to professional fees and negotiated commercial costs associated with business divestiture and manufacturing footprint rationalization activities.

U.S. Tax Reform Related Adjustments: The company recognized an income tax expense of $273.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 for significant items we could reasonably estimate associated with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This expense reflects (i) the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets based on a U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent, (ii) a one-time transition tax on our unremitted foreign earnings and profits, net of foreign tax credits, and (iii) the indefinite reinvestment assertion, including the measurement of deferred taxes on foreign unremitted earnings.
