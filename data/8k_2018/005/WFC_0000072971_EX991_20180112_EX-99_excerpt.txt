[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Financial information for prior quarters in 2017 has been revised to reflect the impact of the adoption in fourth quarter 2017 of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-12 – Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. See footnote (1) to the Summary Financial Data table on page 16 for more information.

(b)Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity investments but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the "Tangible Common Equity" tables on page 35.

(c)The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income).

SAN FRANCISCO – Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported net income of $6.2 billion, or $1.16 per diluted common share, for fourth quarter 2017, compared with $5.3 billion, or $0.96 per share, for fourth quarter 2016, and $4.5 billion, or $0.83 per share, for third quarter 2017.

Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said, “In 2017 we continued executing on our plan to build a better bank for the future, and I'm proud of the hard work and dedication of our team members to put our customers first as we transform Wells Fargo. Over the past year we have invested billions of dollars into our business and capabilities including risk management, accelerated the pace of innovation, increased our commitment to communities, enhanced team member benefits, and continued to execute on our business strategies to provide long-term value to our shareholders. The progress we made over the past year was evident in the fourth quarter in higher deposits, loan growth particularly in commercial loans, increased debit and credit card transactions, and record client assets under management in Wealth and Investment Management. While we faced challenges in 2017, we are a much better company today than we were a year ago, and I am confident that this year Wells Fargo will be even better.”

Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said, “Wells Fargo reported $6.2 billion of net income in the fourth quarter, which included a net benefit from the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act and a gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, partially offset by litigation accruals. Compared with the third quarter we grew both loans and deposits, and our credit performance, liquidity and capital remained exceptionally strong. We returned a record $14.5 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in 2017, up 16 percent, and returning more capital to shareholders remains a priority. We've made progress on our efficiency initiatives and remain committed to our target of $2 billion of expense reductions by the end of 2018, which are being used to support our investments in the business, and an additional $2 billion by the end of 2019. In addition, by the beginning of 2019

we expect the amortization of core deposit intangible expense ($769 million in 2018) and the FDIC special assessment to be complete.”

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income in fourth quarter 2017 was $12.3 billion, down $136 million, compared with third quarter 2017, driven primarily by a negative $183 million one-time adjustment related to leveraged leases due to the Tax Act, which reduced loan yields in the fourth quarter, partially offset by a modest net benefit from all other growth, repricing and variable items. 

Net interest margin was 2.84 percent, down 2 basis points from third quarter 2017. The negative impacts from the one-time adjustment to leveraged leases and growth in average deposits were partially offset by lower average long-term debt and a modest net benefit from all other growth, repricing and variable items.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income in the fourth quarter was $9.7 billion, compared with $9.4 billion in third quarter 2017. Fourth quarter noninterest income reflected higher other income, trust and investment fees, and market sensitive revenue2, partially offset by lower mortgage banking and deposit service charges.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter was $16.8 billion, compared with $14.4 billion in the prior quarter. Fourth quarter expenses included operating losses of $3.5 billion, up from $1.3 billion in the third quarter, primarily reflecting litigation accruals for a variety of matters, including mortgage-related regulatory investigations, sales practices, and other consumer-related matters. Fourth quarter expenses also included higher charitable donations

(up $103 million from the third quarter), commission and incentive compensation expense, outside professional services, and typically higher equipment and advertising expense, which were partially offset by a $117 million gain on the sale of a corporate property. The efficiency ratio was 76.2 percent in fourth quarter 2017, up from 65.7 percent in the third quarter, driven primarily by higher operating losses.

Income Taxes

The Company’s fourth quarter income tax expense was a $1.6 billion benefit and reflected the estimated impact of the Tax Act, including a benefit of $3.89 billion resulting from the re-measurement of the Company's estimated net deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017, partially offset by $173 million of tax expense relating to the estimated tax impact of the deemed repatriation of the Company's previously undistributed foreign earnings. The fourth quarter income tax benefit was also adversely impacted by a $1.0 billion tax effect relating to the impact of discrete non-deductible items (primarily litigation accruals). The full year 2017 effective income tax rate was 18.1 percent. The Company currently expects its full year 2018 effective income tax rate to be approximately 19 percent.

Loans

Total average loans were $951.8 billion in the fourth quarter, down $521 million from the third quarter. Period-end loan balances were $956.8 billion at December 31, 2017, up $4.9 billion from September 30, 2017. Commercial loans were up $3.2 billion from September 30, 2017 with growth in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by declines in commercial real estate loans. Consumer loans increased $1.7 billion from the prior quarter, as growth in real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans and consumer credit card loans was partially offset by expected declines in automobile loans and the junior lien mortgage portfolio.

Period-End Loan Balances

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Investment Securities

Investment securities were $416.4 billion at December 31, 2017, up $1.8 billion from the third quarter, as approximately $20.9 billion of purchases, mostly federal agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in the available-for-sale portfolio, were partially offset by run-off and sales.

Net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities declined to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2017, compared with $1.8 billion at September 30, 2017, primarily due to gains realized in the fourth quarter. Modestly higher Treasury yields were largely offset by tighter credit and agency MBS spreads during the quarter. 

Deposits

Total average deposits for fourth quarter 2017 were $1.3 trillion, up $5.2 billion from the prior quarter. The average deposit cost for fourth quarter 2017 was 28 basis points, up 2 basis points from the prior quarter and 16 basis points 

- 5 -

from a year ago, primarily driven by an increase in commercial and Wealth and Investment Management deposit rates.

Capital

Capital levels remained strong in the fourth quarter, with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (fully phased-in) of 11.9 percent4, compared with 11.8 percent in the prior quarter. In fourth quarter 2017, the Company repurchased 51.4 million shares of its common stock, which reduced period-end common shares outstanding by 36.3 million.

Credit Quality 

Net Loan Charge-offs

The quarterly loss rate was 0.31 percent (annualized), compared with 0.30 percent in the prior quarter. Commercial and consumer losses were 0.09 percent and 0.56 percent, respectively. Total credit losses were $751 million in fourth quarter 2017, up $34 million from third quarter 2017. Commercial losses were up $2 million on lower recoveries in commercial real estate loans. Consumer losses increased $32 million, as higher recoveries on consumer real estate loans and lower losses on automobile loans were offset by higher credit card losses driven by seasonality and portfolio seasoning. 

Net Loan Charge-Offs

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets decreased $647 million, or 7 percent, from third quarter 2017 to $8.7 billion. Nonaccrual loans decreased $583 million from third quarter 2017 to $8.0 billion primarily driven by lower commercial and industrial nonaccruals reflecting continued improvement in the oil and gas portfolio, as well as continued declines in consumer real estate nonaccruals.

Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $12.0 billion at December 31, 2017, down $149 million from September 30, 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 included a $100 million reserve release5, reflecting continued strong credit performance. The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.25 percent compared with 1.27 percent in third quarter 2017. The allowance covered 4.0 times annualized fourth quarter net charge-offs, compared with 4.3 times in the prior quarter. The allowance coverage for nonaccrual loans was 149 percent at December 31, 2017, compared with 141 percent at September 30, 2017. The Company believes the allowance was appropriate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2017.

5 Reserve build represents the amount by which the provision for credit losses exceeds net charge-offs, while reserve release represents the amount by which net charge-offs exceed the provision for credit losses.

Community Banking reported net income of $3.7 billion, up $1.5 billion, or 69 percent, from third quarter 2017. Fourth quarter income tax expense reflected the estimated impact of the Tax Act to the Company and the impact of discrete non-deductible items, primarily litigation accruals. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $12.0 billion, flat compared with third quarter 2017, and included lower net interest income, mortgage banking revenue, and service charges on deposit accounts, offset by higher market sensitive revenue and trust and investment fees. Noninterest expense increased $2.4 billion, or 30 percent, compared with third quarter 2017, driven primarily by litigation accruals. The provision for credit losses decreased $14 million from the prior quarter. 

Net income was up $940 million, or 34 percent, from fourth quarter 2016, and included the income tax benefit from the Tax Act. Revenue increased $367 million, or 3 percent, compared with a year ago due to higher market sensitive revenue and other income, partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue, service charges on deposit accounts, and net interest income. Noninterest expense increased $3.2 billion, or 46 percent, from a year ago primarily driven by litigation accruals. The provision for credit losses increased $5 million from a year ago.

See footnote (1) to the Summary Financial Data table on page 16 for more information.

Wholesale Banking reported net income of $2.1 billion, up $103 million, or 5 percent, from third quarter 2017. Fourth quarter results included the loss from adjustments related to leveraged leases and other tax advantaged businesses due to the Tax Act, as well as a gain related to the completion of the previously announced sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services USA (WFIS). Revenue of $7.1 billion was flat compared with the prior quarter, as the gain related to the sale of WFIS was offset by the impact of the Tax Act and lower market sensitive revenue. Net interest income decreased $134 million, or 3 percent, as the impact to leveraged leases due to the Tax Act was partially offset by higher trading related income and a modest benefit from higher interest rates. Noninterest income increased $144 million, or 5 percent, as the gain related to the sale of WFIS and higher commercial real estate brokerage fees were partially offset by impairments on low income housing and tax-advantaged renewable energy investments due to the Tax Act, lower market sensitive revenue and one less month of WFIS operating income. Noninterest expense decreased $44 million, or 1 percent, from the prior quarter reflecting one less month of WFIS operating expenses and lower operating lease expense. The provision for credit losses decreased $49 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to a reserve release in the fourth quarter.

Net income of $2.1 billion decreased $46 million, or 2 percent, from fourth quarter 2016. Revenue decreased $59 million, or 1 percent, from fourth quarter 2016, as lower net interest income was partially offset by higher noninterest income.

Noninterest income increased $53 million, or 2 percent, from a year ago as the gain related to the sale of WFIS and higher market sensitive revenue were partially offset by impairments on low income housing and tax-advantaged renewable energy investments due to the Tax Act, lower investment banking results, and one less month of WFIS operating income. Noninterest expense increased $202 million, or 5 percent, from a year ago reflecting increased personnel expense and higher regulatory, risk, cyber and technology expenses.

While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation:

•current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of declines in housing prices, high unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters (including the impact of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act), geopolitical matters, and the overall slowdown in global economic growth;

•losses related to recent hurricanes, which primarily affected Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, and related to recent California wildfires, in each case including from damage or loss to our collateral for loans in our consumer and commercial loan portfolios and from the impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans;

•the effect of the current low interest rate environment or changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale;

•significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or financial markets, which could result in, among other things, reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and declines in asset values and/or recognition of other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our investment securities portfolio;

•the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment banking business and our fee income from our brokerage, asset and wealth management businesses;

Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries

SUMMARY FINANCIAL DATA

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Financial information for prior quarters in 2017 has been revised to reflect the impact of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-12 – Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities in fourth quarter 2017. The retrospective application of the changes to certain hedging strategies resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings effective January 1, 2017. The adjustment reduced retained earnings by $381 million and increased other comprehensive income by $168 million. The effect of adoption on previously reported September 30, 2017, year-to-date net income resulted in an increase of $169 million ($242 million pre-tax) and a decrease in other comprehensive income of $163 million. Other affected financial information, including financial ratios, has been revised to reflect this adoption.

(2)Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity investments but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the "Tangible Common Equity" tables on page 35.

(3)The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income).

(4)Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle.

(5)Consumer and small business banking deposits are total deposits excluding mortgage escrow and wholesale deposits.

(6)Book value per common share is common stockholders' equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share is tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding.

CHANGES IN ACCRETABLE YIELD RELATED TO PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS

Loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are considered to be credit impaired. PCI loans predominantly represent loans acquired from Wachovia that were deemed to be credit impaired. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status, recent borrower credit scores and recent LTV percentages. PCI loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Accordingly, the associated allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not carried over at the acquisition date.

As a result of PCI loan accounting, certain credit-related ratios cannot be used to compare a portfolio that includes PCI loans against one that does not, or to compare ratios across quarters or years. The ratios particularly affected include the allowance for loan losses and allowance for credit losses as percentages of loans, of nonaccrual loans and of nonperforming assets; nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans; and net charge-offs as a percentage of loans.

The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is accreted into interest income over the estimated lives of the PCI loans using the effective yield method. The accretable yield is affected by:

•Changes in interest rate indices for variable rate PCI loans - Expected future cash flows are based on the variable rates in effect at the time of the quarterly assessment of expected cash flows;

•Changes in prepayment assumptions - Prepayments affect the estimated life of PCI loans which may change the amount of interest income, and possibly principal, expected to be collected; and

•Changes in the expected principal and interest payments over the estimated life - Updates to changes in expected cash flows are driven by the credit outlook and actions taken with borrowers. Changes in expected future cash flows from loan modifications are included in the regular evaluations of cash flows expected to be collected.

The change in the accretable yield related to PCI loans since the merger with Wachovia is presented in the following table.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes accretable yield released as a result of settlements with borrowers, which is included in interest income.

(2)Includes accretable yield released as a result of sales to third parties, which is included in noninterest income.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(4)Represents changes in cash flows expected to be collected due to the impact of modifications, changes in prepayment assumptions, changes in interest rates on variable rate PCI loans and sales to third parties.

PICK-A-PAY PORTFOLIO (1)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The individual states shown in this table represent the top five states based on the total net carrying value of the Pick-a-Pay loans at the beginning of 2017.

(2)Adjusted unpaid principal balance includes write-downs taken on loans where severe delinquency (normally 180 days) or other indications of severe borrower financial stress exist that indicate there will be a loss of contractually due amounts upon final resolution of the loan.

(3)The current LTV ratio is calculated as the adjusted unpaid principal balance divided by the collateral value. Collateral values are generally determined using automated valuation models (AVM) and are updated quarterly. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate market values of homes based on processing large volumes of market data including market comparables and price trends for local market areas.

(4)Carrying value, which does not reflect the allowance for loan losses, includes remaining purchase accounting adjustments, which, for PCI loans may include the nonaccretable difference and the accretable yield and, for all other loans, an adjustment to mark the loans to a market yield at date of merger less any subsequent charge-offs.

(5)The ratio of carrying value to current value is calculated as the carrying value divided by the collateral value.

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY (1) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity investments but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable investors and others to assess the Company's use of equity.

(2)Financial information for prior quarters in 2017 has been revised to reflect the impact of the adoption in fourth quarter 2017 of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-12 – Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. See footnote (1) to the Summary Financial Data table on page 16 for more information.

(3)Represents goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity investments, which are included in other assets. 

(4)Applicable deferred taxes relate to goodwill and other intangible assets. They were determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period end.

COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 UNDER BASEL III (FULLY PHASED-IN) (1) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Basel III capital rules, adopted by the Federal Reserve Board on July 2, 2013, revised the definition of capital, increased minimum capital ratios, and introduced a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio. These rules established a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations that implements the Basel III capital framework and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules are being phased in through the end of 2021. Fully phased-in capital amounts, ratios and RWAs are calculated assuming the full phase-in of the Basel III capital rules. Fully phased-in regulatory capital amounts, ratios and RWAs are considered non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management, bank regulatory agencies, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Company’s capital position.

(2)Financial information for prior quarters in 2017 has been revised to reflect the impact of the adoption in fourth quarter 2017 of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-12 – Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. See footnote (1) to the Summary Financial Data table on page 16 for more information.

(3)Represents goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity investments, which are included in other assets.

(4)Applicable deferred taxes relate to goodwill and other intangible assets. They were determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period end.

(5)The final Basel III capital rules provide for two capital frameworks: the Standardized Approach, which replaced Basel I, and the Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions. Under the final rules, we are subject to the lower of our CET1 ratio calculated under the Standardized Approach and under the Advanced Approach in the assessment of our capital adequacy. Because the final determination of our CET1 ratio and which approach will produce the lower CET1 ratio as of December 31, 2017, is subject to detailed analysis of considerable data, our CET1 ratio at that date has been estimated using the Basel III definition of capital under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs. The capital ratio for September 30, June 30 and March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, was calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs.

(6)The Company’s December 31, 2017, RWAs and capital ratio are preliminary estimates.
