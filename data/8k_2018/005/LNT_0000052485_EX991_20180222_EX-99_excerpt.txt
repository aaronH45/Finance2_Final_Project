ALLIANT ENERGY ANNOUNCES 2017 RESULTS

MADISON, Wis. - February 22, 2018 - Alliant Energy Corporation (NYSE: LNT) today announced U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP consolidated unaudited earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for 2017 and 2016 as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

“We once again delivered solid financial and operational results in 2017. Our 2017 temperature normalized Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.99, 6% above calendar year 2016, and consistent with our long-term earnings growth goal,” said Patricia Kampling, Alliant Energy Chairman and CEO. “I am proud to report that over the last 5 years we have delivered a total shareholder return of 130%, exceeding the growth of both the S&P 500 and the EEI Utilities Index.”

Utilities and Corporate Services - Alliant Energy’s Utilities and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. (Corporate Services) operations generated $1.82 per share of GAAP EPS from continuing operations in 2017, which was $0.07 per share higher than 2016. The primary drivers of higher EPS were higher margins resulting from Interstate Power and Light Company’s (IPL’s) interim retail electric base rate increase implemented in April 2017 and Wisconsin Power and Light’s (WPL’s) retail electric and gas base rate increases implemented in January 2017. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation expense from rate base additions and updated WPL depreciation rates, higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortization at WPL, and impacts of milder temperatures on retail electric and gas sales in 2017.

Non-utility and Parent - Alliant Energy’s Non-utility and Parent operations generated $0.06 per share of GAAP EPS from continuing operations in 2017, which was $0.26 per share higher than 2016. The primary drivers of higher EPS were asset valuation charges of $0.23 per share related to the Franklin County wind farm in 2016 and effects of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) in 2017.

Earnings Adjustments - Non-GAAP EPS for 2017 excludes the write-down of regulatory assets due to the IPL retail electric rate review settlement and the effects of Tax Reform. Non-GAAP EPS for 2016 excludes asset valuation charges of $0.23 per share related to the Franklin County wind farm. Non-GAAP adjustments, which relate to material charges or income that are not normally associated with ongoing operations, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP.

Temperature impacts to Non-GAAP EPS from Continuing Operations - The estimated impact of milder temperatures on retail electric and gas sales was a $0.06 per share loss in 2017. The temperature normalized Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations for fiscal year 2017 is $1.99. Temperature impacts did not affect Non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations for fiscal year 2016.

Details regarding GAAP EPS from continuing operations variances between 2017 and 2016 for Alliant Energy are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Higher margins from IPL interim retail electric base rate increase - In April 2017, IPL filed a request with the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to increase annual rates for its Iowa retail electric customers. The request was based on a 2016 historical Test Year as adjusted for certain known and measurable changes occurring up to 12 months after the commencement of the proceeding. An interim retail electric rate increase of $102 million, on an annual basis, was implemented effective April 13, 2017. The IUB issued a written order in February 2018 approving a final rate increase of $130 million, on an annual basis.

Higher margins from WPL retail electric and gas base rate increases - In December 2016, WPL received an order from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorizing WPL to implement an increase in annual retail electric and gas rates of $9 million, each. The retail electric rate increase is comprised of a $60 million retail electric base rate increase and a $51 million monitored fuel-related cost decrease. 

Effects of Tax Reform - In December 2017, Tax Reform was enacted. The enactment of Tax Reform had a material impact on the 2017 financial statements since changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. The most significant provision of Tax Reform was the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which required a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities in December 2017. The net impact of re-measuring deferred taxes associated with the non-utility operations and changes in valuation allowances for tax carryforwards resulted in $0.08 of higher EPS in the fourth quarter of 2017. The net impacts of re-measuring deferred taxes associated with regulated utility operations were recorded in regulatory assets and liabilities and expect to be utilized to provide benefits to customers in the future.

2018 Earnings Guidance

Alliant Energy consolidated EPS guidance for 2018 remains unchanged. We are updating the guidance for the reporting companies as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

“The 6% earnings growth between 2017 temperature normalized non-GAAP EPS and the midpoint of 2018 earnings guidance is consistent with our projected long-term annual earnings growth rate of 5 to 7% driven by investments in our utility business,” said Kampling. “The 2018 guidance is based upon approved retail electric base rates for both WPL and IPL, as well as WPL’s approved retail gas base rates. Tax Reform is not forecasted to have a material impact on 2018 earnings.”

Assumptions for Alliant Energy’s 2018 earnings guidance include, but are not limited to:

•Ability of IPL and WPL to earn their authorized rates of return

Without limitation, the expectations with respect to 2018 earnings guidance in this press release are forward-looking statements and are based in part on certain assumptions made by Alliant Energy, some of which are referred to in the forward-looking statements. Alliant Energy cannot provide any assurance that the assumptions referred to in the forward-looking statements or otherwise are accurate or will prove to be correct. Any assumptions that are inaccurate or do not prove to be correct could have a material adverse effect on Alliant Energy’s ability to achieve the estimates or other targets included in the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are made as of the date hereof and, except as required by law, Alliant Energy undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To provide investors with additional information regarding Alliant Energy’s financial results, this press release includes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures include the use of (1) income from continuing operations and EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 excluding the write-down of regulatory assets due to the IPL retail electric rate review settlement, and the effects of Tax Reform; and (2) income from continuing operations and EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 excluding asset valuation charges related to the Franklin County wind farm. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide an alternate measure to better understand and compare across periods the operating performance of Alliant Energy without the distortion of items that management believes are not normally associated with ongoing operations, and also provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy’s management also uses income from continuing operations, as adjusted, to determine performance-based compensation.

In addition, Alliant Energy included in this press release IPL; WPL, excluding ATC Investment; Corporate Services; Utilities and Corporate Services; ATC Investment; and Non-utility and Parent EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends and provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance.

This press release references year-over-year variances in utility electric margins and utility gas margins. Utility electric margins and utility gas margins are non-GAAP financial measures that are reported and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income, in our 2017 Form 10-K.

This press release also includes temperature normalized non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. Alliant Energy believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because the measure facilitates period-to-period comparison of Alliant Energy’s operating performance and provides investors with information on a basis consistent with measures that management uses to assess Alliant Energy’s earnings growth rate.

The tax impact adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments that are excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based on the estimated consolidated statutory tax rate.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings summaries that follow, and in the case of temperature normalized non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations guidance, in the press release above.

Note: Unless otherwise noted, all “per share” references in this release refer to earnings per diluted share.
