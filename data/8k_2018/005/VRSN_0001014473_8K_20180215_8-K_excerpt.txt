On February 15, 2018, VeriSign, Inc. (the "Company") called for the redemption of all of its outstanding 3.25% Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due 2037 (the "Notes"), which were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of August 20, 2007 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, Paying Agent and Conversion Agent. The Notes will be redeemed on May 1, 2018 (the "Redemption Date") at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest up to, but not including, the Redemption Date.

The Notes called for redemption may be converted at any time before 5:00 p.m. New York City time on Monday, April 30, 2018, the business day immediately preceding the Redemption Date (the "Conversion Deadline Date"). Each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes is convertible into 29 shares of common stock of the Company, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances as set forth in the Indenture. The Company hereby notifies the holders that the Settlement Method (as defined in the Indenture) applicable to conversions occurring after the date of this notice and prior to the Conversion Deadline Date shall be Net Share Settlement (as defined in the Indenture). As a result, the Specified Dollar Amount (as defined in the Indenture) applicable to such conversions will be $1,000. The Observation Period (as defined in the Indenture) for conversions during such period will begin on March 15, 2018, the 32nd trading day prior to the Redemption Date, and is expected to end on April 26, 2018. Such conversions are expected to settle on the Redemption Date.
