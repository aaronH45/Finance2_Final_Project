CEO Comments 

“We are pleased to achieve another year of high-quality growth in 2017 with AFFO per share increasing 6.3% to $3.06,” said John P. Case, Realty Income’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our earnings growth during the year was primarily driven by robust property acquisitions volume at investment spreads well above our historical average. We completed over $1.5 billion of property acquisitions in 2017 and also ended the year with portfolio occupancy of 98.4%, matching our highest year-end occupancy rate in the last 10 years. We reached this level of occupancy while generating a rent recapture rate of 106% on our re-leasing activities. The consistency of our operations, continued strength of our balance sheet, and track record of performance contributed to Moody’s raising our credit rating to ‘A3’ in the fourth quarter, placing us among only a few REITs with at least one ‘A’ rating.” 

“Given our healthy real estate and tenant portfolio, active investment pipeline, and conservative capital structure, we enter 2018 from a position of strength. We expect to acquire $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in real estate investments based on current market conditions. Additionally, we are introducing 2018 AFFO per share guidance of $3.14 to $3.20, representing annual growth of approximately 3% to 5%.” 

Financial Results 

Revenue 

Revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 8.0% to $310.7 million, as compared to $287.8 million for the same quarter in 2016. Revenue for 2017 increased 10.2% to $1.216 billion, as compared to $1.103 billion for 2016. 

Net Income Available to Common Stockholders 

Net income available to common stockholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $60.9 million, as compared to $85.7 million for the same quarter in 2016. Net income per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $0.22, as compared to $0.33 for the same quarter in 2016. 

Net income available to common stockholders for 2017 was $301.5 million, as compared to $288.5 million for 2016. Net income per share for 2017 was $1.10, as compared to $1.13 for 2016. 

Net income and FFO per share in 2017 were impacted by a $42.4 million loss, equivalent to $0.15 per share, from the December 2017 early redemption of all $550.0 million outstanding 6.75% notes due August 2019. Net income and FFO were also impacted by a $13.4 million non-cash redemption charge, equivalent to $0.05 per share, on the April 2017 redemption of our 6.625% Monthly Income Class F Preferred Stock. This charge is based on the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the 6.625% Monthly Income Class F Preferred Stock that represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2012. 

The calculation to determine net income for a real estate company includes impairments, gains on property sales and/or fair value adjustments on interest rate swaps. These items can vary from quarter to quarter and can significantly impact net income and period to period comparisons. 

Funds From Operations Available to Common Stockholders (FFO) 

FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 decreased 14.4% to $171.0 million, as compared to $199.8 million for the same quarter in 2016. FFO per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 decreased 20.8% to $0.61, as compared to $0.77 for the same quarter in 2016. 

FFO for 2017 increased 5.1% to $772.7 million, as compared to $735.4 million for 2016. FFO per share for 2017 decreased 2.1% to $2.82, as compared to $2.88 for 2016. 

Adjusted Funds From Operations Available to Common Stockholders (AFFO) 

AFFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 11.6% to $215.3 million, as compared to $193.0 million for the same quarter in 2016. AFFO per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 1.3% to $0.76, as compared to $0.75 for the same quarter in 2016. 

AFFO for 2017 increased 13.9% to $838.6 million, as compared to $736.4 million for 2016. AFFO per share for 2017 increased 6.3% to $3.06, as compared to $2.88 for 2016. 

The company considers FFO and AFFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of a Real Estate Investment Trust’s (REIT’s) operating performance. Realty Income defines FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts’ (NAREIT’s) definition, as net income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus impairments of real estate assets, and reduced by gains on property sales. AFFO further adjusts FFO for unique revenue and expense items, which the company believes are not as pertinent to the measurement of the company’s ongoing operating performance. Presentation of the information regarding FFO and AFFO is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and AFFO in the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. FFO and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. In addition, FFO and AFFO should not be considered as measures of liquidity, our ability to make cash distributions, or our ability to pay interest payments. See the reconciliations of net income available to common stockholders to FFO and AFFO on pages six and seven of this press release.
