On January 30, 2018, Harley-Davidson, Inc.

A copy of the Press Release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

The information furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1 hereto, shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Item 2.05Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.

On January 25, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan to further improve its manufacturing operations and cost structure by commencing a multi-year manufacturing optimization initiative anchored by the consolidation of its motorcycle assembly plant in Kansas City, Missouri, into its plant in York, Pennsylvania.

The Company expects to incur restructuring and other consolidation costs of $170 to $200 million related to this plan through 2019, of which approximately 70% will be cash charges. The Company expects ongoing annual cash savings of $65 to $75 million after 2020.

This Current Report on Form 8-K includes “forward-looking statements” intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as the Company “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “plans,” or “estimates” or words of similar meaning. Similarly, statements that describe future plans, objectives, outlooks, targets, guidance or goals are also forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, unfavorably or favorably, from those anticipated as of the date of this report. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, uncertainties regarding the Company’s ability to effectively execute the Company’s manufacturing optimization initiative within expected costs and timing, as well as the factors detailed in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Shareholders, potential investors, and other readers are urged to consider these factors in evaluating the forward-looking statements and cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this report are only made as of the date of this report, and the Company disclaims any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
