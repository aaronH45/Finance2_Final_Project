As previously reported by McKesson Corporation (the “Company”) in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 18, 2017 (the “Initial Form 8-K”), the Company announced that, effective January 1, 2018, Britt Vitalone would serve as its Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  

At the time of the filing of the Initial Form 8-K, the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of the Company had not determined Mr. Vitalone’s compensation in connection with his new role. The Company is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K/A to amend the Initial Form 8-K to report that on January 4, 2018, the Committee approved compensation arrangements for Mr. Vitalone. Effective as of January 1, 2018, Mr. Vitalone will be paid an annual base salary of $750,000, and his target annual bonus opportunity under the Company’s Management Incentive Plan will be equal to 100% of his salary earned during the performance period. In addition, in recognition of the promotion, the Committee approved a bonus of $500,000 for Mr. Vitalone, to be paid as soon as administratively practicable following approval. As an executive officer Mr. Vitalone will be eligible for an annual executive physical, participation in the Severance Policy for Executive Employees, as amended and restated on April 23, 2013, and Tier One participation in the Change in Control Policy for Selected Executive Employees, as amended and restated on October 26, 2010. In addition, he will continue to be eligible to participate in the Company’s general benefit plans and certain executive benefits for which he was already eligible as a member of the Company’s senior management, such as financial counseling services and executive travel services. For more information about the Company’s executive compensation program, including a description of each plan identified above, please refer to the 2017 annual definitive proxy statement that was filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 16, 2017.
