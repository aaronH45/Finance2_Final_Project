CLEVELAND, January 18, 2018 - KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $181 million, or $.17 per common share, compared to $349 million or $.32 per common share, for the third quarter of 2017 and $213 million, or $.20 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Key’s results included a number of notable items resulting in a net impact of $.19 per common share, including merger-related charges and the estimated impact of tax reform and related actions. Notable items had a net impact of $.03 per common share in the third quarter of 2017 and $.11 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding notable items, earnings per common share were $.36 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $.35 for the third quarter of 2017 and $.31 for the fourth quarter of 2016. 

For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders was $1.2 billion, or $1.12 per common share, compared to $753 million, or $.80 per common share, for the same period one year ago.

Estimated Impact of Tax Reform and Related Actions

As a result of the recent passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017, Key took a number of actions, including the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as certain tax-advantaged assets. This revaluation resulted in an estimated tax expense of $147 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. Noninterest expense increased by $29 million in the quarter related to the impairment of certain tax-advantaged assets and an additional contribution to employee retirement accounts. The total impact of tax reform and related actions was $.16 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2017. The changes resulting from recent tax legislation are reasonable estimates as of December 31, 2017, and may be refined in future periods. 

Beginning January 1, 2018, the new tax law will lower Key's marginal federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Key's effective tax rate will also continue to benefit from the company's investments in certain tax-advantaged assets. Key will be sharing the expected tax benefits with its employees by increasing its minimum wage and making the additional retirement plan contribution referenced above. These actions will benefit over 80% of our workforce and allow us to reward and invest in the financial wellness of our employees.

 TE = Taxable Equivalent

Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $952 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and the net interest margin was 3.09%, compared to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $948 million and a net interest margin of 3.12% for the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting the benefit from higher interest rates and low deposit betas, partly offset by a shift in funding mix into certificates of deposit. Fourth quarter 2017 net interest income included $38 million of purchase accounting accretion related to the acquisition of First Niagara, a decline of $54 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, which included $34 million related to the refinement of third quarter 2016 purchase accounting estimates. 

KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2017 Profit 

January 18, 2018

Page 3

Compared to the third quarter of 2017, taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by $10 million, and the net interest margin decreased by six basis points. The decrease in net interest income and the net interest margin reflects a decline in purchase accounting accretion of $10 million. Additionally, higher interest rates and relatively low deposit betas partially offset a decline in average loan balances, resulting from paydowns and clients continuing to take advantage of attractive capital markets alternatives in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Excluding purchase accounting accretion, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $58 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 and was stable compared to the third quarter of 2017.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Key’s noninterest income was $656 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $618 million for the year-ago quarter. Growth was largely driven by another record quarter of investment banking and debt placement fees, up $43 million from the year-ago period, related to the recent acquisition of Cain Brothers, as well as ongoing growth in the core Key franchise, including strength in commercial mortgage banking. Momentum continued in many fee-based businesses, as cards and payments income and trust and investment services income each grew $8 million from the year-ago period, as a result of higher credit card and merchant fees and strength in the equity markets, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a

January 18, 2018

Page 4

decline in other income, including $7 million of impairments of certain tax-advantaged assets, which were offset by a reduction of related income tax expense. 

Compared to the third quarter of 2017, noninterest income increased by $64 million. The increase is largely driven by broad-based growth in investment banking and debt placement fees, which grew $59 million from the prior quarter. Operating lease income and other leasing gains increased $11 million, related to lease residual losses in the prior quarter. Slightly offsetting these increases was a decline in other income.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Notable items for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes $56 million of merger-related charges and $29 million of estimated impacts of tax reform and related actions. For the third quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2016, notable items includes $36 million and $207 million of merger-related charges, respectively. See the table entitled “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” in the attached financial supplement which presents the computations of certain financial measures related to “notable items.”

Key’s noninterest expense was $1.098 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, and included a number of notable items, including merger-related charges and the estimated impact of tax reform and related actions. Merger-related charges included $26 million of personnel expense and $30 million of non-personnel expense, mostly reflected in net occupancy, marketing and other expense. The fourth quarter of 2017 was the last quarter that merger charges related to the First Niagara acquisition will be reported. The estimated impact of tax reform and other related actions had an impact of $29 million on expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017, including the impairment of certain tax-advantaged assets, as well as a one-time additional contribution to employee retirement accounts. 

Excluding notable items, noninterest expense was unchanged from the year-ago period. Expenses related to acquisitions and investments, including Cain Brothers, as well as higher operating lease expense were offset by the realization of First Niagara cost savings. 

Excluding notable items, noninterest expense increased $57 million from the third quarter of 2017. The increase in personnel expense was largely the result of the acquisition of Cain Brothers early in the fourth quarter, which added $36 million of noninterest expense, as well as increased incentive compensation related to a strong capital markets performance. The increase in nonpersonnel expense was primarily related to higher other expense, as well as increases in net occupancy and operating lease expense. 

 BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Average loans were $86.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $646 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting growth in commercial and industrial loans and indirect auto lending. 

Compared to the third quarter of 2017, average loans decreased by $808 million. Reductions in commercial real estate loans reflected significantly higher debt placements and paydowns throughout the quarter. Additionally, commercial loan balances declined due to lower line utilization in the fourth quarter of 2017. On a period-end basis, commercial and industrial loans increased $712 million, with growth very late in the quarter, therefore having a limited impact on average balances for the quarter. 

At December 31, 2017, the remaining fair value discount on the First Niagara acquired loan portfolio was $266 million, compared to $302 million at September 30, 2017.

Average deposits totaled $103.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $893 million compared to the year-ago quarter. NOW and money-market deposit accounts declined $1.8 billion, largely the result of lower escrow deposits and higher short-term commercial deposits in the fourth quarter of 2016. Certificates of deposits increased $1.3 billion, reflecting strength in Key’s retail banking franchise and core growth from commercial clients. 

Compared to the third quarter of 2017, average deposits increased by $693 million. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased by $762 million from seasonal deposit inflows, and certificates of deposits and other time deposits increased $481 million, reflecting growth in core retail deposits. This growth was partly offset by declines in NOW and money market deposit accounts and savings deposits.

Key’s provision for credit losses was $49 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $66 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $51 million for the third quarter of 2017. Key’s allowance for loan and lease losses was $877 million, or 1.01% of total period-end loans, at December 31, 2017, compared to 1.00% at December 31, 2016, and 1.02% at September 30, 2017.

Net loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $52 million, or .24% of average total loans. These results compare to $72 million, or .34%, for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $32 million, or .15%, for the third quarter of 2017.

At December 31, 2017, Key’s nonperforming loans totaled $503 million, which represented .58% of period-end portfolio loans. These results compare to .73% at December 31, 2016, and .60% at September 30, 2017. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2017, totaled $534 million, and represented .62% of period-end portfolio loans and OREO and other nonperforming assets. These results compare to .79% at December 31, 2016, and .64% at September 30, 2017.

CAPITAL

Key’s estimated risk-based capital ratios included in the following table continued to exceed all “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks at December 31, 2017.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)12/31/2017 ratio is estimated.

(b)The table entitled “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” in the attached financial supplement presents the computations of certain financial measures related to “tangible common equity.” The table reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons. See below for further information on the Regulatory Capital Rules. 

Key's capital position remained strong in the fourth quarter. As shown in the preceding table, at December 31, 2017, Key’s estimated Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios stood at 10.08% and 10.93%, respectively. The decline in Key's capital ratios in the fourth quarter of 2017 was largely 

KeyCorp Reports Fourth Quarter 2017 Profit 

January 18, 2018

Page 6

due to the estimated impact of recent tax reform. This does not change Key's previously announced capital actions. Key's tangible common equity ratio was 8.23% at December 31, 2017. 

As a “standardized approach” banking organization, Key’s mandatory compliance with the final Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Regulatory Capital Rules”) began on January 1, 2015, subject to transitional provisions extending to January 1, 2019. Key’s estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio as calculated under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules was 9.97% at December 31, 2017. This estimate exceeds the fully phased-in required minimum Common Equity Tier 1 and Capital Conservation Buffer of 7.00%.

Consistent with Key's 2017 Capital Plan, during the fourth quarter of 2017, Key declared a dividend of $.105 per common share, an 11% increase from the prior quarter, and the second common share dividend increase of 2017. Key also completed $199 million of common share repurchases during the quarter, including $198 million of common share repurchases in the open market and $1 million of share repurchases related to employee equity compensation programs.

Key Community Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $146 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $106 million for the year-ago quarter, benefiting from momentum in Key's core businesses, as well as First Niagara-related synergies.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $42 million, or 6.7%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the benefit from higher interest rates and a larger balance sheet. Average loans and leases increased $344 million, or .7%, largely driven by a $1.0 billion, or 6.0%, increase in commercial and industrial loans. Additionally, average deposits increased $1.1 billion, or 1.4%, from one year ago.

Noninterest income was up $25 million, or 9.2%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by strength in cards and payments, which includes the impact of Key’s merchant services acquisition in the second quarter of 2017, higher assets under management from market growth, and higher deposit service charges driven by investments in commercial payments.

The provision for credit losses increased by $6 million, or 11.8%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loan charge-offs decreased $7 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily related to lower losses on consumer loans.

Noninterest expense was flat from the year-ago quarter. Personnel expense increased $14 million driven by on-going investments and business acquisitions, including HelloWallet. Nonpersonnel expense decreased by $14 million benefiting from First Niagara related expense synergies and includes the impact of business acquisitions of HelloWallet and Key’s merchant services acquisition.

Key Corporate Bank Summary of Operations (4Q17 vs. 4Q16)

•Record quarter and year for investment banking and debt placement fees

•Positive operating leverage compared to prior year

• Net income down $3 million, or 1.3%, from prior year

 Key Corporate Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $221 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $224 million for the same period one year ago.

 Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $49 million, or 14.8%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, largely related to lower accretion of purchase accounting. Average loan and lease balances increased $716 million, or 1.9%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by growth in commercial and industrial loans. Average deposit balances decreased $1.6 billion, or 7.0%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by the managed exit of higher cost corporate and public sector deposits. 

 Noninterest income was up $22 million, or 7.4%, from the prior year. This increase was largely due to higher investment banking and debt placement fees, which were up $41 million, related to the recent acquisition of Cain Brothers, as well as continued growth in the core Key franchise. This increase was partially offset by a decline in other noninterest income of $16 million, including impairments of certain tax-advantaged assets, as well as a decline in mortgage fees of $4 million.

 During the fourth quarter of 2017, the provision for credit losses decreased $23 million, or 135.3%, and net loan charge-offs declined $10 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, related to improving credit quality in the overall portfolio. 

 Noninterest expense increased by $27 million, or 8.3%, from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase from the prior year was largely driven by the recent acquisition of Cain Brothers as well as impairments to certain tax-advantaged assets related to tax reform.

Other Segments

Other Segments consist of Corporate Treasury, Key’s Principal Investing unit, and various exit portfolios. Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $53 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $34 million for the same period last year.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations

(dollars in millions)

The table below presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to “tangible common equity,” “return on average tangible common equity,” “Common Equity Tier 1,” “pre-provision net revenue,” certain financial measures excluding merger-related charges and/or other notable items, and “cash efficiency ratio.” 

Notable items include certain revenue or expense items that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of ongoing financial performance. Management believes it is useful to consider certain financial metrics with and without merger-related charges and/or other notable items, including the impact of tax reform and related actions, in order to enable a better understanding of Company results, increase comparability of period-to-period results, and to evaluate and forecast those results.

The tangible common equity ratio and the return on average tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing Key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. In October 2013, the federal banking regulators published the final Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Regulatory Capital Rules”). The Regulatory Capital Rules require higher and better-quality capital and introduced a new capital measure, “Common Equity Tier 1,” a non-GAAP financial measure. The mandatory compliance date for Key as a “standardized approach” banking organization began on January 1, 2015, subject to transitional provisions extending to January 1, 2019. 

The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for credit losses makes it easier to analyze the results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.

As previously disclosed, Key completed its purchase of First Niagara on August 1, 2016. The definitive agreement and plan of merger to acquire First Niagara was originally announced on October 30, 2015. As a result of this transaction, Key has recognized merger-related charges. For the third and fourth quarters of 2017, merger-related charges are included in the total for "notable items." The table below shows the computation of earnings per share excluding notable items, return on average tangible common equity excluding notable items, return on average assets from continuing operations excluding notable items, cash efficiency ratio excluding notable items, and pre-provision net revenue excluding notable items. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the merger-related charges and other notable items makes it easier to analyze the results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.

The cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-GAAP performance measures. As such, there is no directly comparable GAAP performance measure. The cash efficiency ratio performance measure removes the impact of Key’s intangible asset amortization from the calculation. The table below also shows the computation for the cash efficiency ratio excluding merger-related charges. Management believes these ratios provide greater consistency and comparability between Key’s results and those of its peer banks. Additionally, these ratios are used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis. 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
