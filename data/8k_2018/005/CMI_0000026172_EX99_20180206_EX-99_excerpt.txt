COLUMBUS, IND. - Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI) today reported results for the fourth quarter of 2017.

Fourth quarter revenues of $5.5 billion increased 22 percent from the same quarter in 2016. Strong demand for trucks, construction and mining equipment drove the majority of the revenue increase. Sales in North America and international markets both increased by 22 percent.

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in the fourth quarter were $620 million, or 11.3 percent of sales, up from $526 million or 11.7 percent of sales a year ago. EBIT was negatively impacted by $39 million as a result of charges incurred by unconsolidated joint ventures related to U.S. tax reform. Excluding the impact of tax reform, EBIT for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $659 million or 12.0 percent of sales.

Net income attributable to Cummins in the fourth quarter was a net loss of $274 million (a loss of $1.65 per diluted share), compared to net income of $378 million ($2.25 per diluted share). Fourth quarter net income included $777 million in one-time charges related to tax reform. Excluding the tax reform impact, 

net income attributable to Cummins in the fourth quarter was $503 million ($3.03 per diluted share), reflecting a 19.5 percent tax rate. 

Revenues for the full year 2017 were $20.4 billion, 17 percent higher than 2016. Revenues in North America increased 15 percent and international sales increased 19 percent.

EBIT for the year was $2.4 billion or 12.0 percent of sales, or 12.2 percent of sales excluding charges related to tax reform. This compares to $2.0 billion or 11.4 percent of sales in 2016. 

Net income attributable to Cummins for the full year was $999 million ($5.97 per diluted share), compared to $1.4 billion ($8.23 per diluted share) in 2016. Excluding charges totaling $777 million in connection with tax reform, full year net income attributable to Cummins was $1.8 billion ($10.62 per diluted share), with a full year tax rate of 24.5 percent. 

“The Company delivered strong growth, solid profitability and record operating cash flow in 2017,” said Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger. “We expect demand to remain strong in many of our core markets in 2018 and profitability to improve as a result of higher sales and continued execution of our cost reduction initiatives. The Company again plans to return at least 50 percent of Operating Cash Flow to shareholders in 2018.”

Based on the current forecast, Cummins expects full year 2018 revenues to be up 4 to 8 percent, and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to be in the range of 15.8 to 16.2 percent of sales. EBITDA for the full year 2017 was 15.0 percent of sales, excluding the impact of US tax reform.
