Exhibit 99.1  

McKESSON REPORTS FISCAL 2018 THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS  

   •   Revenues of $53.6 billion for the third quarter, up 7% year-over-year.  

   •   Third-quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $4.32, up 51% year-over-year. GAAP earnings per diluted share included a net tax benefit of approximately $370 million, or $1.78, related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.   

   •   Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share of $3.41, up 12% year-over-year, compared to $3.04 in the prior year.  

   •   Fiscal 2018 Outlook: GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $7.65 to $9.00.  

   •   Fiscal 2018 Outlook: Adjusted Earnings of $12.50 to $12.80 per diluted share.  

SAN FRANCISCO, February 1, 2018 – McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) today reported that revenues for the third quarter ended December 31, 2017, were $53.6 billion, up 7% compared to $50.1 billion a year ago. On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), third-quarter earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $4.32, compared to $2.86 a year ago. Third-quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share included a net tax benefit of approximately $370 million, or $1.78, driven by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  

Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share, which excludes the $1.78 net tax benefit driven by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, was $3.41, up 12% compared to $3.04 a year ago. Third-quarter results were driven by a lower share count, organic growth across multiple business units, including the company’s strategic sourcing benefits through ClarusONE, incremental profit contribution from acquisitions and a lower tax rate, which included discrete tax benefits unrelated to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. These positive drivers were partially offset by lower profit in our Technology Solutions segment driven by the contribution of the majority of the businesses to Change Healthcare and the sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions business, and the impact of reduced reimbursement in the company’s U.K. retail pharmacy business. Prior year third-quarter results included two non-recurring charges totaling approximately $60 million in our Distribution Solutions segment.

“Our third-quarter results reflected operating performance in line with our expectations, complemented by a lower share count and lower tax rate,” said John H. Hammergren, chairman and chief executive officer. “As a result of the lower tax rate and share count, we are raising and narrowing our Fiscal 2018 Adjusted Earnings outlook from a range of $11.80 to $12.50 per diluted share to a new range of $12.50 to $12.80 per diluted share.”  

For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson generated cash from operations of $1.3 billion and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.6 billion. Through the first nine months of the year, McKesson repaid $545 million in long-term debt, paid $2.0 billion for acquisitions, repurchased $900 million of its common stock, invested $392 million internally and paid $192 million in dividends.  

“We deployed capital in line with our portfolio approach during the third quarter, announcing the RxCrossroads acquisition and repurchasing shares, providing a return to shareholders while continuing to position McKesson for growth in a rapidly evolving industry,” concluded Hammergren.  

Segment Results  

Distribution Solutions revenues were $53.6 billion for the quarter, up 8% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis.  

North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues of $44.9 billion for the quarter were up 8% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis, primarily reflecting market growth and acquisitions.  

International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $7.0 billion for the quarter, up 13% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by acquisitions and market growth.  

Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 9%, primarily driven by market growth.  

In the third quarter, Distribution Solutions GAAP operating profit was $819 million and GAAP operating margin was 1.53%. Third-quarter adjusted operating profit was $991 million, up 23% from the prior year on a reported basis and 22% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin for the Distribution Solutions segment was 1.85% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin excluding noncontrolling interests for the Distribution Solutions segment was 1.77% on a constant currency basis.  

2  

Technology Solutions GAAP operating profit was $65 million for the third quarter, primarily driven by a gain on the sale of the company’s Enterprise Information Solutions business. Third-quarter adjusted operating profit was $53 million, primarily driven by our proportionate share of the income from McKesson’s equity investment in Change Healthcare.  

Fiscal Year 2018 Outlook  

McKesson expects GAAP earnings per diluted share of $7.65 to $9.00 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, which includes the following items:  

   •   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.35 to $2.65 per diluted share;  

   •   Acquisition-related expenses and adjustments of $1.00 to $1.20 per diluted share;  

   •   Last-In-First-Out (“LIFO”) inventory-related charges of five cents to credits of five cents per diluted share;  

   •   Gains from antitrust legal settlements of up to five cents per diluted share;  

   •   Restructuring charges of $1.25 to $1.45 per diluted share; and  

   •   Other adjustments resulting in credits of $0.50 to $0.70 per diluted share.  

McKesson expects Adjusted Earnings of $12.50 to $12.80 per diluted share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018.  

Dividend Declaration

Adjusted Earnings  

McKesson separately reports financial results on the basis of Adjusted Earnings. Adjusted Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP income from continuing operations, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments, LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring charges, and other adjustments. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings is provided in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

Adjusted Operating Profit Margin Excluding Noncontrolling Interests  

McKesson also provides adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests. The company has arrangements involving third-party noncontrolling interests.

Adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests information is presented to provide a framework for assessing how the company’s business performed excluding the effect of pre-tax earnings that is not attributable to McKesson.

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company’s financial results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), McKesson Corporation (the “Company” or “we”) also presents the following Non-GAAP measures in this press release. The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company’s Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles—Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business combinations and/or the formation of joint ventures and equity method investments.  

Acquisition-related expenses and adjustments—Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business combinations, the formation of joint ventures and the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange. Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, legal fees, restructuring or severance charges, retention payments and employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred revenues, contingent consideration and inventory, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, gains or losses related to foreign currency contracts entered into directly due to acquisitions, gains or losses on business combinations, and gain on the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange.  

LIFO inventory-related adjustments—LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.  

Gains from antitrust legal settlements—Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.  

Restructuring charges—Non-acquisition related restructuring charges that are incurred for significant programs in which we change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, realignment of operations or products, and/or Company-wide cost saving initiatives. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which includes normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded.  

Other adjustments—The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our Adjusted Earnings from time to time. While not all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: gains or losses from divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations and from dispositions of assets; asset impairments; adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses; certain discrete benefits related to the December 2017 enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; and other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate.  

Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, “Income Taxes,” which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.  

Additionally, our equity method investments’ financial results are adjusted for the above noted items.

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company internally uses Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Specifically, Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its business internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We present adjusted operating profit margin excluding noncontrolling interests to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of net income that is not attributable to McKesson. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
