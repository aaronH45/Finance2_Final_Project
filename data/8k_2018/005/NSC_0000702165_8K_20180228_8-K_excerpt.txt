Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.  

On February 28, 2018, Norfolk Southern Corporation (the “Registrant”) completed its offering of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.150% Senior Notes due 2048 (the “Notes”) pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated February 13, 2018 (the “Agreement”), by and among the Registrant and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The Notes were sold pursuant to the Registrant’s Automatic Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-222869). The Agreement was initially filed as Exhibit 1.1 to the Registrant’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 15, 2018.  

The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of February 28, 2018 (the “Base Indenture”), as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture, dated as of February 28, 2018 (the “First Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”), each between the Registrant and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes will pay interest semi-annually in arrears at a rate of 4.150% per annum.  

The Notes may be redeemed in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Registrant’s option, as described below.  

If the Notes are redeemed prior to the date that is six months prior to their maturity date, the redemption price for the Notes to be redeemed will be equal to the greater of (i) 100% of their principal amount or (ii) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed to and including the date that is six months prior to the maturity date of the Notes (exclusive of interest accrued to, but not including, the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a specified rate, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but not including, the redemption date.  

If the Notes are redeemed on or after the date that is six months prior to the maturity date for the Notes, the redemption price for the Notes to be redeemed will equal 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued interest to, but not including, the redemption date.  

The Base Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture are filed herewith as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively. The description of the Indenture contained herein is qualified by reference thereto.
