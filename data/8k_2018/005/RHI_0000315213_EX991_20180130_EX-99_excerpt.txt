ROBERT HALF REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER AND YEAR-END FINANCIAL RESULTS

MENLO PARK, Calif., January 30, 2018 — Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE symbol: RHI) today reported revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. 

For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net income was $47 million, or $.38 per share, on revenues of $1.35 billion. Net income for the prior year’s fourth quarter was $78 million, or $.61 per share, on revenues of $1.27 billion.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $291 million, or $2.33 per share, on revenues of $5.27 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net income was $343 million, or $2.67 per share, on revenues of $5.25 billion. 

Included in fourth-quarter 2017 earnings was the estimated impact of a one-time, non-cash charge to the company’s provision for income taxes of $34 million, or $.27 per share, resulting from the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The charge results primarily from a revaluation of the company’s deferred income tax net assets as of December 31, 2017. Excluding this charge, fourth-quarter 2017 net income was $81 million, or $.65 per share, and full-year 2017 net income was $324 million, or $2.60 per share.

“We were encouraged by the broad-based acceleration of revenue growth rates during the fourth quarter in our staffing operations and Protiviti. Both our U.S. and non-U.S. operations posted strong results, with our permanent placement business leading the way,” said Harold M. Messmer, Jr., chairman and CEO of Robert Half. “The U.S. labor market continues to tighten, resulting in talent shortages in some occupations and higher demand for our services.”

ROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The financial results of Robert Half International Inc. (the “Company”) are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). To help readers understand the Company’s financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with revenue growth rates derived from non-GAAP revenue amounts. 

Variations in the Company’s financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and billing days. The Company provides “same billing days and constant currency” revenue growth calculations to remove the impact of these items. These calculations show the year-over-year revenue growth rates for the Company’s lines of business on both a reported basis and on a same-day, constant-currency basis for global, U.S. and international operations. This information is presented for each of the six most recent quarters. The Company has provided this data because management believes it better reflects the Company’s actual revenue growth rates and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time. The Company expresses year-over-year revenue changes as calculated percentages using the same number of billing days and constant currency exchange rates.

Additionally, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, the Company is including non-GAAP financial results for net income and diluted income per share, and for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the return on invested capital, which reflect the estimated impact of the one-time, non-cash charge to its provision for income taxes from the recently enacted TCJA. The Company has provided this data because management believes that it better reflects the Company’s actual fourth-quarter and year-end financial results.

The non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to actual revenue growth derived from revenue amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided on the following pages.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

REVENUE GROWTH RATES (%) (UNAUDITED):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The non-GAAP financial measures included in the table above adjust for the following items:

Foreign Currency Translation. The “As Reported” revenue growth rates are based upon reported revenues, which include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to calculate “Constant Currency” revenue growth rates, as-reported amounts are retranslated using foreign exchange rates from the prior year’s comparable period.

Billing Days. The “As Reported” revenue growth rates are based upon reported revenues. Management calculates a global, weighted-average number of billing days for each reporting period based upon input from all countries and all lines of business. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billing days, the company calculates “same billing day” revenue growth rates by dividing each comparative period’s reported revenues by the calculated number of billing days for that period to arrive at a “per billing day” amount. The “same billing day” growth rates are then calculated based upon the “per billing day” amounts.

The term “same billing days and constant currency” means that the impact of different billing days has been removed from the constant currency calculation. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP year-over-year revenue growth rates to the “As Reported” year-over-year revenue growth rates is included herein on Pages 8-10.

(a)The fourth quarter of 2017 includes an estimated one-time, non-cash charge to the Company’s provision for income taxes, resulting from the recently enacted TCJA. The charge results primarily from a revaluation of the Company’s estimated deferred income tax net assets as of December 31, 2017. The final impact of the TCJA may differ due to factors such as further refinement of the Company’s calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions that the Company has made, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Government, and action the Company may take.
