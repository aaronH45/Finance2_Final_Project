(1)Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share primarily exclude the impacts of non-cash intangibles amortization, transformation initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension settlement gain, and Nucleic Acid Solutions Division (“NASD”) site costs. We also exclude any tax benefits or expenses that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or are not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. For Q1 FY18, the impact of Tax Reform is also excluded. A reconciliation between non-GAAP net income and GAAP net loss is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.

(2)Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Core revenue is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation between Q1 FY18 GAAP revenue and core revenue is set forth on page 7 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure. Core revenue growth rate as projected for full fiscal year 2018 excludes the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Most of these exclude amounts that pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided for the projection. 

(3)Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q2 FY18 and full fiscal year 2018 excludes primarily the impacts of non-cash intangibles amortization, transformation initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension settlement gain, and Nucleic Acid Solutions Division (“NASD”) site costs. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or are not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability, including the impact of Tax Reform. Most of these excluded amounts that pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $25 million per quarter. 

(4)For the three months ended January 31, 2018, our preliminary provision for income taxes is $553 million. This includes a $533 provision charge for the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) enactment. This charge primarily consists of: 1) an estimated provision of $480 million for U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries; and 2) an estimated provision of $53 million associated with the decrease in the 

3

US corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and its impact on the Company’s US deferred tax assets and liabilities. The taxes payable associated with the transition tax, net of tax attributes, on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is approximately $440 million, payable over 8 years. The final impact of Tax Reform may differ materially from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, analysis and assumptions made by the Company, additional guidance that may be issued, and actions that the Company may undertake.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) The adjustment for taxes excludes tax benefits that management believes are not directly related to on-going operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. For the three months ended January 31, 2018, management uses a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 18.0%. In the same periods last year, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19.0%.

(b) GAAP diluted net loss per share was computed using 323 million weighted average diluted shares which excludes from consideration the anti-dilutive effects of all potential common shares outstanding.

(c) Non-GAAP diluted net income per share was computed using 327 million weighted average diluted shares which includes the dilutive effects of potential common shares outstanding.

We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to amortization of intangibles, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, pension settlement gain, NASD site costs, special compliance costs, and adjustment for Tax Reform.

Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, small site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. Included in this category are also expenses associated with the post-separation resizing of the IT infrastructure and streamlining of IT system as well as company programs to transform our product lifecycle management (PLM) system and financial systems.

Acquisition and Integration costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, the transfer of assets and intellectual property, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs. 

Pension settlement gain resulted from transfer of the substitutional portion of our Japanese pension plan to the government.

NASD site costs include all the costs related to the expansion of our manufacturing of nucleic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients incurred prior to the commencement of commercial manufacturing.

Special compliance costs include costs associated with transforming our processes to implement new regulations such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), revenue recognition and certain tax reporting requirements.

Other includes certain legal costs and settlements in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments.

Adjustment for Tax Reform primarily consists of an estimated provision of $480 million for U.S. transition tax and correlative items on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and an estimated provision of $53 million associated with the decrease in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and its impact on our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. The taxes payable associated with the transition tax, net of tax attributes, on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings is approximately $440 million, payable over 8 years. The final impact of Tax Reform may differ materially from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, analysis and assumptions made, additional guidance that may be issued, and actions that we may undertake.

Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.

Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance.

Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.
