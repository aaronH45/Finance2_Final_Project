[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

  “By just about any measure, 2017 was a successful year for PNC,” said PNC Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer William S. Demchak. “We grew loans and deposits and added customers across our businesses, continued to focus on expense management, and generated record fee income for the year, as well as in the fourth quarter. The year ended with a benefit from the new tax legislation, giving us increased flexibility as we continue to invest in our businesses, communities and our employees, which helps drive our Main Street banking model. We executed on our strategic priorities throughout the year, including our technology initiatives and the expansion of our middle market franchise into new markets. As we enter the new year, we believe we are firmly positioned to create long-term value for our shareholders.”

PNC's fourth quarter and full year 2017 reported net income and earnings per share benefited from the new federal tax legislation net of significant items, as summarized in the following table.

PNC Reports Record Full Year 2017 Net Income of $5.4 Billion, $10.36 Diluted EPS – Page 2

The benefit from tax legislation on fourth quarter 2017 net income was primarily attributable to revaluation of deferred tax liabilities at the lower statutory tax rate. The net charge for significant items included the previously announced contribution to the PNC Foundation and employee cash payments and pension account credits, Visa Class B derivative fair value adjustments primarily related to extension of anticipated timing of litigation resolution, and charges for real estate dispositions and exits including datacenters. These items were partially offset by the flow through benefit of tax legislation from PNC's equity investment in BlackRock. Details of the impact of tax legislation and significant items by income statement line item are provided in the following table.

This news release includes financial metrics that have been adjusted for the impact of new tax legislation and significant items. Such adjusted metrics are considered non-GAAP financial information. These metrics may be useful to management, investors and analysts because the company believes they better reflect the ongoing financial results and trends of its businesses and increase comparability of period-to-period results. Fee income, a non-GAAP financial measure, refers to noninterest income in the following categories: asset management, consumer services, corporate services, residential mortgage and service charges on deposits. Information in this news release including the financial tables is unaudited.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $135 million compared with the third quarter driven by higher noninterest income, and increased $386 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2016 due to increases in both net interest income and noninterest income. 

Net interest income was stable with the third quarter. Excluding the impact of tax legislation related to leveraged leases, net interest income increased $26 million, or 1 percent, as a result of higher loan balances and higher loan and securities yields partially offset by higher deposit and borrowing costs. In the comparison with fourth quarter 2016, the increase in net interest income was due to higher loan and securities yields and higher loan balances offset in part by higher borrowing and deposit costs. 

The net interest margin declined to 2.88 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 2.91 percent for the third quarter. The impact of tax legislation related to leveraged leases reduced the fourth quarter net interest margin by 3 basis points and lowered the average yield on loans by 5 basis

points. The third quarter comparison also reflected higher deposit and borrowing costs partially offset by higher securities yields in the fourth quarter of 2017. The margin increased compared with 2.69 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016 due to higher loan and securities yields partially offset by higher deposit and borrowing costs. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $135 million compared with the third quarter and $171 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.

Asset management revenue increased $299 million over the third quarter and $321 million compared with fourth quarter 2016 reflecting a $254 million fourth quarter flow through impact of tax legislation from PNC’s equity investment in BlackRock as well as higher equity markets.

Consumer service fees and service charges on deposits grew in both comparisons as a result of increased customer activity, including debit card, credit card and brokerage fees.

Strong growth in corporate service fees of $52 million compared with the third quarter and $36 million compared with fourth quarter 2016 was primarily attributable to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and loan syndication fees and growth in treasury management product revenue. 

Residential mortgage revenue declined $75 million compared with the third quarter and $113 million compared with fourth quarter 2016 due to a $71 million negative adjustment for residential mortgage servicing rights fair value assumption updates as well as lower loan sales revenue. 

Other noninterest income decreased $152 million compared with the third quarter and $101 million compared with fourth quarter 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 other noninterest income included $248 million of negative derivative fair value adjustments related to swap agreements with purchasers of Visa Class B common shares. These fair value adjustments were primarily related to extension of anticipated timing of litigation resolution.

Occupancy expense increased $36 million compared with the third quarter primarily due to $29 million of the real estate disposition and exit charges. Other noninterest expense increased $392 million over the third quarter reflecting the contribution to the PNC Foundation and $168 million of the real estate disposition and exit charges.

Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $620 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the impact of fourth quarter 2017 significant items as well as ongoing business and technology investments. 

An income tax benefit was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the new tax legislation and was primarily attributable to revaluation of deferred tax liabilities at the lower statutory tax rate of 21 percent.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Overall credit quality for the fourth quarter of 2017 remained stable with the third quarter. Provision for credit losses for fourth quarter 2017 decreased $5 million compared with the third quarter. The provision for the consumer lending portfolio increased due to loan growth, higher delinquencies in auto and credit card in part due to seasonality and the residual impact of hurricanes, and the impact of a home equity loan reserve release in the third quarter. This increase was more than offset by a lower provision for the commercial lending portfolio reflecting stable credit quality and reversal of hurricane reserves. 

Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2017 decreased $32 million compared with September 30, 2017 due to lower other real estate owned and foreclosed and other assets as well as lower nonperforming residential real estate loans. These declines were partially offset by higher nonperforming commercial loans primarily in the retail/wholesale trade category largely attributable to a single borrower. In the comparison with December 31, 2016, nonperforming assets decreased $339 million as both consumer and commercial nonperforming loans declined. Nonperforming assets to total assets were .53 percent at December 31, 2017 compared with .55 percent at September 30, 2017 and .65 percent at December 31, 2016.

Overall delinquencies as of December 31, 2017 increased $101 million, or 7 percent, compared with September 30, 2017 reflecting increases in residential mortgage, auto and credit card, in part due to seasonality and the residual impact of hurricanes. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more

increased $59 million driven by government insured residential mortgage, accruing loans 30 to 59 days increased $59 million and accruing loans past due 60 to 89 days decreased $17 million. 

Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $17 million in both comparisons due to charge-offs of certain commercial purchased impaired loans that were previously fully reserved. Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2017 were .22 percent of average loans on an annualized basis compared with .19 percent for the third quarter and .20 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016. 

The allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans was 1.18 percent at both December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 and 1.23 percent at December 31, 2016. The allowance to nonperforming loans was 140 percent at December 31, 2017, 139 percent at September 30, 2017 and 121 percent at December 31, 2016.

Effective for the first quarter of 2017, as a result of changes to how PNC manages its businesses, it realigned its segments and, accordingly, has changed the basis of presentation of its segments, resulting in four reportable business segments: Retail Banking, Corporate & Institutional Banking, Asset Management Group and BlackRock. For purposes of this news release, BlackRock has been combined with Other. In addition, PNC made certain adjustments to its internal funds transfer pricing methodology primarily relating to weighted average lives of certain non-maturity deposits. These changes in methodology affected business segment results, primarily adversely impacting net interest income for Corporate & Institutional Banking and Retail Banking, offset by increased net interest income in Other. All 2016 periods presented were revised to conform to the new segment alignment and to reflect the change in internal funds transfer pricing methodology.

Retail Banking earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased in both comparisons. The fourth quarter 2017 loss included income tax expense of $139 million as a result of the new tax legislation. Fourth quarter 2017 noninterest income included $248 million of negative derivative fair value adjustments related to Visa Class B common shares and $71 million negative impact from residential mortgage servicing rights fair value assumption updates. Additionally, in both comparisons noninterest income reflected lower residential mortgage loan sales revenue partially offset by higher consumer service fees, including debit card, credit card and brokerage fees, and higher service charges on deposits. Provision for credit losses increased over both prior periods reflecting loan growth, higher delinquencies in auto and credit card in part due to seasonality and the residual impact of hurricanes, and the impact of a home equity loan reserve release in the third quarter. Noninterest expense increased in both comparisons as a result of higher personnel and compliance expense, real estate disposition and exit charges, and investments in technology, partially offset by release of legal reserves. 

▪Average loans increased 1 percent in both comparisons as growth in residential mortgage, auto and credit card loans was partially offset by lower home equity, commercial, and education loans.

▪Average deposits grew 2 percent over the fourth quarter of 2016 due to higher demand deposits as well as an increase in savings deposits which was partially offset by lower money market deposits reflecting a shift to relationship-based savings products.

▪Approximately 50 percent of fourth quarter 2017 residential mortgage loan origination volume was for home purchase transactions compared with 57 percent for the third quarter and 33 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Corporate & Institutional Banking earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased compared with both the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 earnings included a benefit of $373 million in income taxes and a negative impact of $26 million related to leveraged leases in net interest income as a result of the new tax legislation. Noninterest income increased compared with the third quarter primarily due to higher capital markets fees, including merger and acquisition advisory fees, and higher net gains on commercial mortgage loans held for sale partially offset by lower gains on asset sales. In the fourth quarter 2016 comparison, noninterest income increased largely due to higher capital markets fees, including merger and acquisition advisory fees, higher operating lease income related to a business acquired in the second quarter of 2017 and growth in treasury management product revenue. Provision for credit losses was a benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 reflecting stable credit quality and reversal of hurricane reserves. Noninterest expense increased in both comparisons primarily due to variable costs associated with increased business activity and investments in technology and infrastructure, as well as expenses associated with the acquired business in the comparison with fourth quarter 2016. 

▪Average loans increased 1 percent over the third quarter and 8 percent over the fourth quarter of 2016 driven by broad-based growth across lending segments. The prior year comparison was also impacted by acquired loans in the second quarter of 2017.

▪Average deposits increased 2 percent over the third quarter reflecting seasonal growth. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, deposits increased 1 percent primarily driven by growth in interest-bearing demand deposits partially offset by a decline in noninterest-bearing demand deposits.

CAPITAL RATIOS

As a result of the phased-in periods included in the final U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules (Basel III rules), as well as the fact that PNC remains in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, PNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2017 and 2016 are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets, and the definitions of, and deductions from, regulatory capital under the Basel III rules (as such definitions and deductions are phased-in for 2017 and 2016, respectively). We refer to the capital ratios calculated using the phased-in Basel III provisions in effect for each year and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized approach risk-weighted assets, as Transitional Basel III ratios. Under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, past due exposures, equity exposures and securitization exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.

We provide information below regarding PNC’s estimated December 31, 2017 and actual September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 Transitional Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratios and PNC’s estimated pro forma fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio. Under the Basel III rules applicable to PNC, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets must be deducted from capital (subject to a phase-in schedule and net of associated deferred tax liabilities) to the extent they individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of the institution's adjusted common equity Tier 1 capital. Also, Basel III regulatory capital includes (subject to a phase-in schedule) accumulated other comprehensive income related to securities currently and previously held as available for sale, as well as pension and other postretirement plans.

(a)Represents net adjustments related to accumulated other comprehensive income for securities currently and previously held as available for sale, as well as pension and other postretirement plans.

(b)Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets.

(c)Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III advanced approaches rules, and include credit, market and operational risk-weighted assets. During the parallel run qualification phase, PNC has refined the data, models and internal processes used as part of the advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets. We anticipate additional refinements through the parallel run qualification phase.

PNC utilizes the pro forma fully phased-in Basel III capital ratios to assess its capital position (without the benefit of phase-ins), as these ratios represent the regulatory capital standards that may ultimately be applicable to PNC under the final Basel III rules. Our Basel III capital ratios and estimates may be impacted by additional regulatory guidance or analysis, and, in the case of those ratios calculated using the advanced approaches, may be subject to variability based on the ongoing evolution, validation and regulatory approval of PNC’s models that are integral to the calculation of advanced approaches risk-weighted assets as PNC moves through the parallel run approval process.

Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated based on tangible common shareholders’ equity divided by period-end common shares outstanding. We believe this non-GAAP measure serves as a useful tool to help evaluate the strength and discipline of a company's capital management strategies and as an additional, conservative measure of total company value.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information

We make statements in this news release and related conference call, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, and other matters regarding or affecting PNC and its future business and operations that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance.

Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.

▪Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including the following:

–Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets.

–Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets.

–Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates.

–Changes in customer behavior due to newly enacted tax legislation, changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory initiatives.

–Changes in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness.

–Slowing or reversal of the current U.S. economic expansion.

–Commodity price volatility.

▪Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our current view that U.S. economic growth will accelerate somewhat in 2018, thanks to stimulus from recently passed corporate and personal income tax cuts that will support business investment and consumer spending, respectively. Further gradual improvement in the labor market this year, including job gains and rising wages, is another positive for consumer spending. Other sources of growth for the U.S. economy in 2018 will be the global economic expansion and the housing market. Although inflation slowed in 2017, it should pick up as the labor market continues to tighten. Short-term interest rates and bond yields are expected to rise throughout 2018; PNC’s baseline forecast is for three increases in the federal funds rate in 2018, pushing the rate to a range of 2.00 to 2.25 percent by the end of the year. Longer-term rates are also expected to increase as the Federal Reserve slowly reduces the size of its balance sheet and the federal government borrows more, but at a slower pace than short-term rates, so we anticipate the yield curve will flatten but not invert.

▪PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to review by the Federal Reserve Board as part of PNC’s comprehensive capital plan for the applicable period in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process and to the acceptance of such capital plan and non-objection to such capital actions by the Federal Reserve Board.

▪PNC’s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company’s financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect (particularly those implementing the international regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee)), and management actions affecting the composition of PNC’s balance sheet. In addition, PNC’s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory approval of related models.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information (Continued)

▪Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain management. These developments could include:

–Changes resulting from legislative and regulatory reforms, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, consumer protection, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles 

–Changes to regulations governing bank capital and liquidity standards, including due to the Dodd-Frank Act and initiatives of the Basel Committee.

–Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. These matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to PNC.

–Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.

–Impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general.

▪Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards. 

▪Business and operating results also include impacts relating to our equity interest in BlackRock, Inc. and rely to a significant extent on information provided to us by BlackRock. Risks and uncertainties that could affect BlackRock are discussed in more detail by BlackRock in its SEC filings.

▪We grow our business in part through acquisitions. Acquisition risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, and the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.

▪Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.

▪Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist activities, system failures, security breaches, cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically.

We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2016 Form 10-K and our 2017 Form 10-Qs, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in those reports, and in our subsequent SEC filings. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those we may discuss elsewhere in this news release or in our SEC filings, accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our corporate website at www.pnc.com/secfilings.
