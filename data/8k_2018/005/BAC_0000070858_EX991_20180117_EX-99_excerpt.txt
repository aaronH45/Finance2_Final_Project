9 A The Corporation also measures net interest income on an FTE basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. FTE basis is a performance measure used in operating the business that management believes provides investors a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. The Corporation believes that this presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources, and is consistent with industry practices. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $11.7 billion and $10.5 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. For reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, refer to pages 17–18 of this press release. The FTE adjustment was $251 million, $240 million, $237 million, $197 million and $234 million for Q4-17, Q3-17, Q2-17, Q1-17 and Q4-16 respectively. The FTE adjustment will decline in 2018 as a result of a lower U.S. corporate tax rate; reductions to the FTE adjustment will be offset in tax expense. B The financial information under Financial Highlights excluding the Tax Act impact, return on average tangible common shareholders' equity, and tangible book value per share of common stock are non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation to GAAP financial measures of the financial information included under Financial Highlights excluding the Tax Act impact, refer to the table on page 1, or below. For reconciliation of return on average tangible common shareholder's equity and tangible book value per share of common stock to GAAP financial measures, see pages 17–18 of this press release. Enactment of the Tax Act reduced Q4-17 net income by $2.9 billion and negatively impacted Q4-17 and FY 2017 return on average assets by 49 bps and 13 bps, respectively; return on average common shareholders’ equity by 455 bps and 117 bps, respectively; return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity by 630 bps and 162 bps, respectively; and efficiency ratio by 287 bps and 67 bps, respectively. Reported metrics are shown on page 1 of this press release. C Pretax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) is a non-GAAP financial measure. PPNR is total revenue, net of interest expense (on an FTE basis), less noninterest expense. Consumer Banking total revenue, net of interest expense (on an FTE basis) was $9.0 billion and $8.1 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Noninterest expense was $4.5 billion and $4.3 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. D Rankings per Dealogic as of January 2, 2018 for the year ended December 31, 2017, excluding self-led deals. E Global Markets revenue and net income, excluding net debit valuation adjustments (DVA), and sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, are non- GAAP financial measures. Net DVA losses were $118 million, $21 million and $101 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Net DVA losses were $428 million and $238 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. FICC net DVA losses were $112 million, $14 million and $98 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. FICC net DVA losses were $394 million and $238 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Equities net DVA losses were $6 million, $7 million and $3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Equities net DVA losses were $34 million and $0 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. F Liquidity Coverage Ratio at December 31, 2017 is preliminary. Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, limited to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS, and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities, and are readily available to meet funding requirements as they arise. They do not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity among legal entities may be subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) represents the consolidated average amount of high-quality liquid assets as a percentage of the prescribed average net cash outflows over a 30-calendar-day period of significant liquidity stress, under the U.S. LCR final rule. Time to required funding (TTF) is a debt coverage measure and is expressed as the number of months unsecured holding company obligations of Bank of America Corporation can be met using only the Global Liquidity Sources held at the BAC parent company and NB Holdings without the BAC parent company issuing debt or sourcing additional liquidity. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation. G Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2017 are preliminary. Fully phased-in estimates are non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, refer to page 13 of this press release. As an Advanced approaches institution, we are required to report regulatory capital risk-weighted assets and ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy, which is the Advanced approaches for the periods presented. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we obtained approval from U.S. banking regulators to use our internal models methodology (IMM) to calculate counterparty credit risk-weighted assets for derivatives under the Advanced approaches. Fully phased-in estimates for prior periods assumed approval. H The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital calculated on a fully phased-in basis. The denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted Tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average of certain off- balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. Off-balance sheet exposures primarily include undrawn lending commitments, letters of credit, potential future derivative exposures and repo-style transactions. Effective October 1, 2017, the Corporation changed its accounting method for stock-based compensation awards granted to retirement-eligible employees from expensing their value in full at the grant date (generally in the first quarter of each year) to expensing the estimated value ratably over the year prior to the grant date. This change affects consolidated financial information and All Other; it does not affect the business segments. All prior periods presented herein have been restated for this change in accounting method. Under the applicable bank regulatory rules, we are not required to and, accordingly, did not restate previously filed capital metrics and ratios. Endnotes

We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on pages 17-18. (2) Includes non-U.S. credit card net charge-offs of $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, including $31 million and $44 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017. These net charge-offs represent net charge-offs of non-U.S. credit card loans, which were sold in the second quarter of 2017. (3) Ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. Charge-off ratios are annualized for the quarterly presentation. (4) Balances do not include past due consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and individually insured long-term stand-by agreements (fully-insured home loans), and in general, other consumer and commercial loans not secured by real estate; purchased credit-impaired loans even though the customer may be contractually past due; and nonperforming loans held-for-sale or accounted for under the fair value option. (5) For the fourth quarter of 2016, excluding the non-U.S. consumer credit card allowance of $243 million and loans and leases of $9.2 billion, the allowance for loan and lease losses is $11.2 billion and the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding is 1.25%. (6) As an Advanced approaches institution, we are required to report regulatory capital risk-weighted assets and ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy, which is the Advanced approaches for the periods presented. (7) Tangible equity ratio equals period-end tangible shareholders' equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible common equity ratio equals period-end tangible common shareholders' equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible shareholders' equity and tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on pages 17-18. (8) Fully phased-in estimates are non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliations to GAAP financial measures, see above. (9) During the fourth quarter of 2017, we obtained approval from U.S. banking regulators to use our internal models methodology (IMM) to calculate counterparty credit risk-weighted assets for derivatives under the Advanced approaches. Fully phased-in estimates for prior periods assumed approval. Effective October 1, 2017, the Corporation changed its accounting method for stock-based compensation awards granted to retirement-eligible employees from expensing their value in full at the grant date (generally in the first quarter of each year) to expensing the estimated value ratably over the year prior to the grant date. This change affects consolidated financial information and All Other; it does not affect the business segments. All prior periods presented herein have been restated for this change in accounting method. Under the applicable bank regulatory rules, we are not required to and, accordingly, did not restate previously-filed capital metrics and ratios.

Current period information is preliminary and based on company data available at the time of the presentation. 17 The Corporation evaluates its business based on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP financial measure. Total revenue, net of interest expense, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The Corporation believes that this presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax- exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. The Corporation presents related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratios and net interest yield) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. To derive the fully taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, the Corporation uses the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the basis points the Corporation earns over the cost of funds. The Corporation also evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders' equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders' equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. See the tables below and on page 18 for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to financial measures defined by GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the three months ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in understanding its results of operations and trends.
