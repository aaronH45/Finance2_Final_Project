MIAMI, February 16, 2018 – Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE: R), a leader in commercial fleet management, dedicated transportation, and supply chain solutions, today reported fourth quarter and full-year earnings and revenue. Results for the three months ended December 31 were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Exhibit 99.1

In the fourth quarter, the Company reported record total revenue and record operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding all fuel and subcontracted transportation). Total revenue and operating revenue grew across all three business segments reflecting new business and higher volumes. Total revenue also grew due to higher fuel costs passed through to customers. Total and operating revenue for the three months ended December 31 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Commenting on the Company’s fourth quarter results, Ryder Chairman and CEO Robert Sanchez said, "We performed in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter, with outperformance in Dedicated Transportations Solutions, and benefits from a favorable tax rate (unrelated to tax reform), offset by Fleet Management Solutions results. Our Dedicated business performed above expectations, due to favorable development of prior years' self-insurance claims. Supply Chain Solutions results met our earnings expectations with strong revenue growth in the quarter. We delivered growth in our contractual businesses, including the sixth consecutive year of ChoiceLease fleet growth. We also realized strong sales across all contractual businesses in the fourth quarter, leading to a record sales year for the Company. 

"With the continuing benefit of secular trends that favor outsourcing, we grew the ChoiceLease fleet by 4,100 vehicles for the year, above our prior forecast of 3,500. We continue to tap into non-outsourced markets, with approximately 40% of our lease fleet growth coming from customers that are new to outsourcing. We also grew our SelectCare business by 5,400 vehicles year to date.

"Fleet Management Solutions also benefited from stronger than expected rental demand, resulting in the highest fourth quarter utilization in the past 10 years. However, FMS results were negatively impacted by used vehicle sales, additional accelerated depreciation, and higher insurance costs related to prior years' claims. Used vehicle sales results were below expectations, primarily due to pricing. Given our near-term outlook on pricing, the Company also recognized additional accelerated depreciation in the fourth quarter 

Exhibit 99.1

and extended accelerated depreciation through mid-2019. We effectively executed our plan to reduce used inventory to the bottom of our target range, better positioning us for 2018.

"As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in the fourth quarter, we recognized a significant tax benefit to reduce deferred tax liabilities that we no longer expect to incur under the new law. We also expect the new law to improve our earnings going forward due to a significant reduction in our effective income tax rate, allowing us to raise our dividend by 13%. Also, related to the passing of this law, we awarded a one-time bonus, totaling $23 million in the aggregate, to all U.S.-based non-incentive eligible employees of the Company as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we believe the new tax law further enhances Ryder's typical ChoiceLease advantage versus ownership.

"During the quarter, we concluded activity under the 2 million share anti-dilutive program and purchased an aggregate of 1.6 million shares under the program. Additionally, in December, the Company announced a new two-year 1.5 million share anti-dilutive repurchase program.

"In 2017, we made significant progress on our strategic objective to penetrate non-outsourced markets, with growth in each of the three segments. We continued to deploy new customer-facing technologies including innovative safety technologies and our cloud-based shipment visibility tool, RyderShareTM, to better optimize transportation costs and service. Additionally, our previously announced strategic vehicle partnerships with companies in the electric and advanced vehicle technology sectors, position Ryder to drive additional long-term growth by providing our customers with cutting-edge vehicle technology.”

Fourth Quarter Business Segment Operating Results

Fleet Management Solutions

In the Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment, total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.24 billion, up 8% from the year-earlier period. FMS operating revenue (non-GAAP measure excluding fuel) was $1.06 billion, up 7% from the year-earlier period. Ryder ChoiceLeaseTM (lease) revenue increased 6%, reflecting a larger average fleet size and higher prices on replacement vehicles. The lease fleet (excluding U.K. trailers) increased by 2,800 vehicles from the year-earlier period. As previously noted, the Company has had an elevated number of vehicles being prepared for sale in the prior quarters. Adjusting for a reduction in these vehicles during the prior quarter, the lease fleet grew by 4,100 units over the same period, and grew by 2,100 vehicles sequentially from the third quarter of 2017. 

Exhibit 99.1

Commercial rental revenue grew 7% due to increased demand and higher pricing. Fuel services revenue increased 16%, reflecting higher fuel costs passed through to customers.

FMS earnings before tax were $91.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 43% compared with $64.3 million in the same period of 2016. Increased earnings reflect higher commercial rental and lease performance as well as improved used vehicle sales results. Used vehicle sales comparisons primarily reflect prior year inventory valuation adjustments of $21 million. As planned, the Company reduced inventory by approximately 30% in 2017, ending the year at the low end of the targeted range. Commercial rental performance improved due to higher pricing and increased utilization, reflecting stronger demand as well as the Company's fleet right-sizing actions taken earlier in the year. Rental power fleet utilization was 81.2% for the fourth quarter, up 390 basis points from the year-earlier period. Lease results benefited from fleet growth. These items were partially offset by higher compensation-related costs. Fourth quarter FMS results also included the impact of accelerated depreciation of $8.8 million in 2017 and $9.6 million in 2016 to reflect a challenging used vehicle market outlook. FMS earnings before tax as a percentage of FMS total revenue and FMS operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure) were 7.4% and 8.7%, respectively, up 180 and 220 basis points from the year-earlier period.

Dedicated Transportation Solutions

In the Dedicated Transportation Solutions (DTS) business segment, fourth quarter 2017 total revenue was up 11% to $284 million and operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) was $198 million, up 3% compared with the year-earlier period. DTS total revenue growth reflects higher subcontracted transportation revenue and operating revenue. DTS operating revenue growth reflects increased volumes. 

DTS earnings before tax of $15.4 million increased 1% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $15.3 million in 2016. Favorable development of self-insurance claims from prior years was largely offset by higher driver costs due to increased turnover and seasonal volumes at select accounts, as well as elevated maintenance costs on certain older model year vehicles. DTS earnings before tax as a percentage of DTS total revenue and operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure) were 5.4% and 7.8%, respectively, down 50 and 10 basis points from the year-earlier period.

Supply Chain Solutions

Exhibit 99.1

In the Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment, total revenue was $540 million, up 26%, and operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) was $411 million, up 16% compared with the year-earlier period. SCS total revenue and operating revenue growth primarily reflect new business.

SCS earnings before tax of $27.7 million increased 5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $26.4 million in 2016, primarily driven by revenue growth. This increase was partially offset by lower performance in two customer accounts, although to a lesser extent than in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, results were impacted by higher overhead spending due to planned investments in information technology and sales. SCS earnings before tax as a percentage of SCS total revenue and operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure) were 5.1% and 6.8%, respectively, down 100 and 70 basis points from the year-earlier period.

Corporate Financial Information

Central Support Services

Central Support Services (CSS) are overhead costs incurred to support all business segments and product lines. Most CSS costs are allocated to the business segments. In the fourth quarter of 2017, unallocated CSS costs were $15 million, up from $11 million reported in the year-earlier period, driven by incentive compensation and professional fees.

Income Taxes

The Company’s effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a benefit of 715.4% compared to an expense of 28.8% in the year-earlier period and reflects the impact of accounting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform). The net benefit from Tax Reform totaled $586 million and reflects the provisional estimates of the change in future tax rates on deferred tax balances at December 31, 2017, offset by a one-time tax related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. The comparable effective income tax rate (a non-GAAP measure) from continuing operations, which excludes Tax Reform and other items, was 30.4% compared with 30.1% in the year-earlier period. 

Additional Items Excluded from Segment and Comparable Earnings 

Non-operating components of pension costs are excluded from both segment earnings before tax and comparable earnings (a non-GAAP measure) to more accurately reflect the operating performance of the 

Exhibit 99.1

business. Non-operating pension costs totaled $6.9 million ($4.0 million after tax) or $0.07 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $7.9 million ($4.6 million after tax) or $0.09 per diluted share in the year-earlier period.

Fourth quarter 2017 results also reflect a gain on sale of a SCS property of $24.1 million ($14.8 million after tax) or $(0.27) per diluted share, restructuring charges and consulting fees of $19.7 million ($12.7 million after tax) or $0.24 per diluted share, including company-wide workforce reductions of approximately 260 employees. The Company expects the workforce reduction and other cost savings initiatives to produce annual savings of $0.50 per diluted share beginning in early 2018. Fourth quarter 2016 results excluded pre-tax restructuring and other charges of $5.1 million ($3.5 million after tax), or $0.06 per diluted share. 

Fourth quarter 2017 results reflect a one-time, non-cash benefit from Tax Reform of $586 million or $11.04 per diluted share to reduce deferred tax liabilities the Company no longer expects to incur under the new law. In addition, results reflect a one-time employee bonus in connection with the benefit of Tax Reform awarded to all U.S.-based non-incentive eligible employees of the Company, totaling $23 million ($14 million after tax) in the aggregate of $0.27 per diluted share. 

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures from continuing operations were $1.94 billion for 2017, compared with $1.76 billion in 2016, reflecting higher planned investments to refresh the rental fleet, partially offset by lower lease spending due to greater use of redeployed vehicles to fulfill new lease contracts. Proceeds, primarily from used vehicle sales, of $429 million increased 2% from $421 million. Net capital expenditures (including proceeds from the sale of assets) increased to $1.51 billion in 2017, compared with $1.34 billion in 2016.

Cash Flow and Leverage

Operating cash flow from continuing operations in 2017 was $1.55 billion, down slightly from $1.60 billion in 2016. Total cash generated from continuing operations (including proceeds from used vehicle sales) in 2017 was $2.05 billion, down slightly from $2.10 billion in 2016. Free cash flow from continuing operations in 2017 was $190 million, compared with $194 million in 2016.

Total debt as of December 31, 2017 was 5.41 billion, substantially unchanged from year-end 2016. Debt to equity as of December 31, 2017 was 191% compared with 263% at year-end 2016. Adoption of Tax Reform reduced the Company's debt to equity ratio as of December 31, 2017 by approximately 50 

Exhibit 99.1

percentage points. The Company is revising its target debt to equity ratio to 200% - 250% from 250% to 300%, reflecting the impact of Tax Reform.

2018 Earnings Forecast

Commenting on the Company’s outlook, Mr. Sanchez said, “In 2018, we are anticipating solid earnings growth across all business segments. Higher expected earnings are driven by robust contractual revenue growth from record sales results in 2017 as well as the strength of our sales pipeline. We forecast a significant increase in ChoiceLease fleet growth of 6,500 vehicles, driven by a continued trend toward 

Exhibit 99.1

outsourcing, our ongoing sales and marketing initiatives, and a strengthening freight environment. We are also anticipating strong rental revenue growth in this accelerating freight environment. We plan to grow the rental fleet by 6% as well as increase pricing. In DTS and SCS, we are also expecting revenue growth and margin expansion due to improved operating performance. Additionally, we instituted a zero-based budgeting process, significantly lowering overhead costs. We also anticipate 2018 earnings to benefit from Tax Reform, primarily due to a lower effective income tax rate. These expected overhead reductions and tax benefits will improve earnings and fund 2018 strategic investments in sales and marketing, new product development, and technology, which are focused on driving long term revenue and earnings growth.

"These benefits are expected to be partially offset by impacts from the extended downturn in the used vehicle market as well as higher maintenance costs on certain older model year vehicles that will largely exit the fleet over the next 18 months. We anticipate a modestly improved outlook for used vehicle pricing in 2018 that will benefit year over year results; however, we still expect used vehicle sales to incur a loss for the year. We are also reducing our long-term residual value estimates on vehicles in operation to reflect used vehicle market trends. Additionally, we are further accelerating depreciation on vehicles which we expect to make available for sale through mid-2019.

"We are planning significantly higher capital expenditures this year primarily due to increased investments to grow our lease fleet, and to refresh and expand our rental fleet. We expect to deliver higher operating cash flow of $1.8 billion, reflecting the returns from several years of fleet investment. Free cash flow is forecast at negative $600 million, reflecting increased capital spending to support fleet growth.

"Ryder forecasts full-year 2018 GAAP earnings of $5.34 to $5.64 per diluted share, compared with $14.87 per diluted share in 2017. Ryder forecasts full-year 2018 comparable earnings from continuing operations of $5.40 to $5.70 per diluted share, compared with $4.53 per diluted share in 2017. Full-year earnings exclude non-operating pension costs of $0.06 per diluted share in 2018 and exclude the items previously noted in 2017. Total revenue for the full-year 2018 is forecast to be up 6% to approximately $8 billion. Operating revenue for the full-year 2018 is forecast to be up 8% to approximately $7 billion. 

"Ryder is establishing a first quarter 2018 GAAP earnings forecast of $0.82 to $0.89 per diluted share, compared with $0.71 in the first quarter 2017. The Company is also establishing a first quarter 2018 comparable earnings forecast of $0.83 to $0.90 per diluted share, compared with $0.82 in the first quarter 2017. First quarter earnings comparisons exclude pension costs of $0.01 per diluted share in 2018. The 

Exhibit 99.1

first quarter presents the most challenging quarter for year-over-year comparison and reflects the timing of FMS overhead spending, including commissions and investments in sales, marketing, and technology to fund growth, as well as increased vehicle depreciation. In addition, prior year results include an unusually strong quarter for SCS. These headwinds are expected to be partially offset by earnings growth in rental and lease, as well as the benefit of Tax Reform."

Capital Expenditures: In Ryder’s business, capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors, and trailers) primarily to support the full service lease product line and secondarily to support the commercial rental product line within Ryder’s FMS business segment. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long-term agreements that result in ongoing revenues and cash flows to Ryder, typically over a three- to ten-year term. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the Company’s fleet available for shorter-term use by contractual or occasional customers.
