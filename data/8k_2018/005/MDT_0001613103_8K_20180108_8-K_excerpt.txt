Item 2.05Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

On January 8, 2018, Medtronic plc (the “Company”) announced a multi-year global Enterprise Excellence Program (the “Program”) designed to drive long-term business growth and sustainable efficiency. The Program is expected to further leverage the Company’s global size and scale as well as enhance the customer and employee experience. 

The Enterprise Excellence Program will be focused on three main categories:

•Global Operations - integrating and enhancing global manufacturing and supply processes, systems and site presence to improve quality, delivery, cost and cash flow

•Functional Optimization - enhancing and leveraging global operating models and systems across several enabling functions to improve productivity and employee experience

•Commercial Optimization - optimizing certain processes, systems and models to improve productivity and the customer experience 

This effort will be managed by a central Program Management Office and is expected to result in annual gross savings of more than $3 billion by the end of the Company’s fiscal year 2022. The Program is designed to drive operating margin improvement as well as fund investment in strategic growth initiatives. 

A portion of the Program will result in pre-tax exit and disposal costs and other charges of approximately $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, the vast majority of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2022 and result in cash outlays to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2023. The estimated charges are primarily associated with employee transition and training investments, professional services, consulting, and employees dedicated to the implementation of the restructuring plans, with an estimated 40 to 50 percent of the charges associated with other employee-related costs, including severance and other termination benefits to be incurred at sites around the world during the next five years. While the company anticipates there will be some employees impacted as a result of the restructuring and realignment plans, the Company expects that its overall employee base will remain relatively unchanged, as new jobs are created in new capability areas and resources are deployed to support the Company’s growing market needs.

It is possible that additional charges and future cash payments could occur in relation to the restructuring plans. The Company will provide additional disclosures in the event additional restructuring charges are individually or collectively determined to be significant. Such disclosures would be provided after the Company is able to make good faith determinations of the estimated amount or range of amounts by each major type of cost and future cash expenditures relating to such plans.
