Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $5.30 billion for 2017, 30% lower than 2016, due to significantly lower net revenues in commodities, interest rate products, currencies and credit products, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in mortgages. During 2017, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution operated in a challenging environment characterized by low levels of volatility and low client activity.  

Net revenues in Equities were $6.60 billion, 4% lower than 2016, due to lower commissions and fees, reflecting lower market volumes in the U.S., and lower net revenues in equities client execution, reflecting lower net revenues in derivatives, partially offset by higher net revenues in cash products.

During 2017, Equities operated in an environment characterized by increasing global equity prices, while volatility levels and client activity levels remained low.

Fourth Quarter  

Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $2.37 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, 34% lower than the fourth quarter of 2016 and 24% lower than the third quarter of 2017.  

Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $1.00 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, 50% lower than the fourth quarter of 2016, which included more favorable market conditions. This decrease was due to significantly lower net revenues in currencies, credit products, interest rate products and commodities. Net revenues in mortgages were lower.

Full Year  

Net revenues in Investing & Lending were $6.58 billion for 2017, 61% higher than 2016. Net revenues in equity securities were $4.58 billion, 78% higher than 2016, primarily reflecting a significant increase in net gains from private equities, which were positively impacted by company-specific events and corporate performance. In addition, net gains from public equities were significantly higher, as global equity prices increased during the year. Net revenues in debt securities and loans were $2.00 billion, 33% higher than 2016, reflecting significantly higher net interest income (2017 included approximately $1.80 billion of net interest income).

Net revenues in debt securities and loans were $449 million, 2% lower than the fourth quarter of 2016, due to higher provisions for loan losses, primarily reflecting an impairment of a secured loan, largely offset by higher net interest income (the fourth quarter of 2017 included approximately $500 million of net interest income).  

Investment Management  

Full Year  

Net revenues in Investment Management were $6.22 billion for 2017, 7% higher than 2016, due to higher management and other fees, reflecting higher average assets under supervision, and higher transaction revenues. During the year, total assets under supervision (5) increased $115 billion to $1.49 trillion. Long-term assets under supervision increased $128 billion, including net market appreciation of $86 billion, primarily in equity and fixed income assets, and net inflows of $42 billion (6), primarily in fixed income and alternative investment assets.

Long-term assets under supervision increased $21 billion, reflecting net market appreciation of $22 billion, primarily in equity assets, and net outflows of $1 billion.

Non-Compensation Expenses  

Full Year  

Non-compensation expenses were $9.09 billion for 2017, 5% higher than 2016, reflecting higher expenses related to consolidated investments and the firm’s online consumer lending and deposit platform. These increases were primarily included in depreciation and amortization expenses, market development expenses and other expenses. In addition, technology expenses increased, reflecting higher expenses related to cloud-based services and software depreciation, and professional fees increased, primarily related to consulting costs. These increases were partially offset by lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, and lower occupancy expenses (primarily related to exit costs in 2016).  

Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for 2017 were $188 million compared with $396 million for 2016.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  

This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only the firm’s beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm’s control. It is possible that the firm’s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm’s future results and financial condition, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  

Information regarding the impact of Tax Legislation, the firm’s capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, supplementary leverage ratio, total assets and balance sheet data, level 3 assets and global core liquid assets consists of preliminary estimates. These estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its financial statements. Information regarding the impact of Tax Legislation is based on the firm’s current calculations, as well as the firm’s current interpretations, assumptions and expectations relating to Tax Legislation, which are subject to further guidance and change.  

Statements about the firm’s investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect the firm’s investment banking transactions, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

 (1)  

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and lowers U.S. corporate income tax rates as of January 1, 2018, implements a territorial tax system and imposes a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The estimated impact of Tax Legislation was an increase in income tax expense of $4.40 billion, of which $3.32 billion was due to the repatriation tax and $1.08 billion was due to the effects of the implementation of the territorial tax system and the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates. The impact of Tax Legislation may differ from this estimate, possibly materially, due to, among other things, further refinement of the firm’s calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions the firm has made, guidance that may be issued and actions the firm may take as a result of Tax Legislation.

Management believes that presenting the firm’s results excluding Tax Legislation is meaningful as excluding this item increases the comparability of period-to-period results. Diluted earnings per common share and ROE excluding the impact of Tax Legislation are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Unvested share-based awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are treated as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per common share. The impact of applying this methodology for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was a loss per common share (basic and diluted) of $0.01. In addition, the impact of applying this methodology was a reduction in basic earnings per common share of $0.06 and $0.05 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and $0.02 for both the three months ended September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
