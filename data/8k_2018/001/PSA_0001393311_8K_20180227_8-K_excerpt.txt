Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year  

On February 27, 2018, the Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of Public Storage (the “Company”) approved an amendment and restatement of the Company’s Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), to implement proxy access by adding a new Article III, Section 17 to the Company’s Bylaws. The Bylaws also reflect certain technical, conforming and clarifying changes made to several other sections of the previous bylaws of the Company.  

The Bylaws will permit qualifying shareholders, or a qualifying group of no more than 20 shareholders, that have continuously owned at least 3% of the Company’s outstanding common shares throughout at least a three-year period, to include in the Company’s proxy materials a number of trustee nominees up to the greater of two trustees or 20% of the number of trustees serving on the Board, provided that the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws and subject to the terms and conditions therein. Proxy access candidates may be nominated pursuant to the Bylaws beginning with the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders.  

The foregoing description of the Company’s Bylaws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
