Newell Brands Provides Update on  

Accelerated Transformation Plan at CAGNY Conference  

Highlights Progress on Accelerated Post-Acquisition Transformation Plan  

Management Focused On Driving Growth and Improved Operational Performance  

Reaffirms Full-Year 2018 Outlook  

HOBOKEN, NJ – February 22, 2018 – Newell Brands Inc. (NYSE: NWL) Chief Executive Officer Michael B. Polk today will highlight the strong progress the company is making to achieve improved operational performance and accelerate its transformation plan at the 2018 Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) Conference. As previously announced, the company has identified an accelerated path to transform Newell and deliver enhanced value for shareholders. Through these initiatives, which will be discussed further during the presentation, Newell will emerge simpler, faster and stronger:  

   •   Optimizing the portfolio to ensure focus on brands with attractive margins and growth potential in global categories. Following a series of potential divestitures, Newell expects to have nine core consumer divisions with approximately $11 billion in net sales and $2 billion of EBITDA. The remaining businesses have strong POS trends, faster growth trajectories related to nearly 20% of their U.S. sales being e-commerce based, deep innovation pipelines and simplified customer and supply chain footprints. Collectively, the remaining businesses are expected to benefit from a more than 50 percent reduction in commodity exposure, significantly higher ecommerce penetration and expected improvement in gross and operating margins.   

   •   Driving operational efficiency and simplifying operations, including a 50 percent reduction in the company’s global factory and warehouse footprint, a 50 percent reduction in its customer base and the consolidation of 80 percent of global sales on two enterprise resource planning (ERP) platforms by the end of 2019. These changes are intended to accelerate overhead reduction, exit more cyclical industrial businesses to capitalize on robust, record-high multiples and improve shared operations, productivity and working capital.  

   •   Improving financial flexibility and increasing free cash flow productivity. Newell’s divestiture plan is expected to generate approximately $6 billion in net proceeds after taxes, with roughly two-thirds of those proceeds to be used for debt reduction and one third available for additional share repurchases. The company continues to focus on achieving its remaining $730 million synergies and cost savings target, including approximately $275 million in 2018, to fuel further investments, expand margins and drive cash flow generation.  

   •   Capitalizing on Newell’s scale and differentiated capabilities to drive market share gains through innovation, e-commerce and international deployment.  

Reaffirms 2018 Full-Year Outlook  

The company also reaffirmed its full-year 2018 outlook previously provided on its fourth quarter earnings call and earnings release on February 16, 2018.
