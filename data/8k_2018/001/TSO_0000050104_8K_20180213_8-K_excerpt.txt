2018 Incentive Compensation Program

On February 13, 2018, the Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of our Board of Directors approved the terms of the 2018 Incentive Compensation Program (the “2018 Program”). In addition, the Compensation Committee approved the target payouts for our Chief Executive Officer and other named executive officers. Payouts under the 2018 Program are based on a combination of corporate results and individual performance (as further described below).

The performance results may be adjusted to take into account unbudgeted business decisions, unusual or non-recurring items and other factors, as approved by the Compensation Committee, to determine the total amount, if any, available under the 2018 Program and can range from 0% to 200%. The Compensation Committee has discretion to adjust individual awards based on an assessment of each executive officer's overall performance.

Corporate Performance - Corporate performance metrics include the following:

•EBITDA, weighted at 50% - Achievement of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization measured on a margin neutral basis;

•Growth, Productivity and Synergies Improvements, weighted at 20% - Targeted improvements from growth initiatives, productivity with existing assets and synergies from acquisitions to create value;

•Cost Management, weighted at 15% - Measurement of operating expenditures versus budget;

•Process Safety Management, weighted at 5% - Targeted improvement in the number of process safety incidents;

•Environmental, weighted at 5% - Targeted improvement in the number of environmental incidents; and

•Personal Safety, weighted at 5% - Targeted improvement in the number of recordable personal safety incidents over the average for the past three years.

An assessment of each executive officer’s overall performance, taking into account the performance of his or her respective business unit, successful achievement of goals, business plan execution, and other leadership attributes, will be used as a basis for adjusting the executive officer’s payout above or below the amount determined by the overall Corporate Performance.

The target payout amounts for the Chief Executive Officer and named executive officers are as follows:

Form Agreement for 2018 Awards Under the Andeavor Amended and Restated 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan

On February 13, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved (1) the form of 2018 Grant Letter (the “PS Grant Letter”) pursuant to which Performance Shares were issued under the Andeavor Amended and Restated 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) as well as the related Summary of Key Provisions for Performance Share Awards Granted (the “PS Key Provisions”) and (2) the form of 2018 Grant Letter (the “MSU Grant Letter”) pursuant to which market stock units were issued under the Plan as well as the related Summary of Key Provisions for Market Stock Unit Award Granted (the “MSU Key Provisions”). These documents set forth the terms of 2018 grants of performance shares and market stock units to certain participants under the Plan, including the Chief Executive Officer and other named executive officers.

The PS Key Provisions contemplate that performance shares of our common stock contingent upon the achievement of certain performance goals will vest at the end of the 36-month performance period, which lasts from February 13, 2018 through February 13, 2021. Upon vesting at the end of the performance period, awards will be adjusted based on achievement of the applicable performance conditions.

The MSU Grant Letter and MSU Key Provisions contemplate that market stock units pursuant to which shares of our common stock will be earned at vesting based on stock price performance will vest at the end of the 36-month performance period, which lasts from February 13, 2018 through February 13, 2021. Upon vesting at the end of the performance period, the number of shares earned will be adjusted by multiplying the factor of the average closing stock price for the 30 days prior to the vesting date over the average closing stock price for the 30 days prior to the grant date.

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual terms of the PS Grant Letter, PS Key Provisions, MSU Grant Letter and MSU Key Provisions, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
