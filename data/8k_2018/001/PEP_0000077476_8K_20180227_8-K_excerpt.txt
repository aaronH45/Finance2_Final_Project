Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

PepsiCo, Inc. (PepsiCo) is furnishing this Current Report on Form 8-K to aid investors by providing supplemental information related to the retrospective impact of presenting net periodic benefit cost in accordance with revised guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).

As previously disclosed in PepsiCo’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 (the 2017 Form 10-K), the FASB issued guidance in 2017 that requires companies to retrospectively present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and retiree medical plans along with other compensation costs in operating profit and present the other components of net periodic benefit cost separately below operating profit in the income statement. The guidance also allows only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization within inventory or fixed assets on a prospective basis. PepsiCo adopted the guidance when it became effective in the first quarter of 2018. PepsiCo also updated its allocation of service costs to its divisions to better approximate actual service cost. The impact from retrospective adoption of this guidance includes a decrease in operating profit of $233 million for the year ended December 30, 2017 and an increase in operating profit of $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily impacting selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 7 to PepsiCo’s consolidated financial statements in the 2017 Form 10-K for additional information.

The changes described above will have no impact on PepsiCo’s consolidated net revenue, net income or earnings per share. The following table shows the (decreases)/increases to operating profit for the respective periods presented below:
