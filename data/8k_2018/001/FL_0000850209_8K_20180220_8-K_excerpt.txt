On February 20, 2018, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Foot Locker, Inc. (the “Company”) amended the Company’s by-laws, effective immediately (as amended, the “Amended By-Laws”), primarily to provide for proxy access.  

Article II, Section 11 has been added to the Amended By-Laws to permit a shareholder, or group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least 3% of the Company’s outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years as of the date of the notice of nomination, to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials director nominees constituting up to two individuals or 20% of the Board, whichever is greater (subject to certain limitations set forth in the Amended By-Laws), provided that the shareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the Amended By-Laws, including that notice of a nomination be received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the date the Company first distributed its proxy statement for the immediately preceding year’s annual meeting. 

The Amended By-Laws were also amended to make certain clarifications, updates and refinements to the advance notice by-laws for shareholder nominations and proposals of business, contained in Article I, Section 13 and Article II, Section 2, and to make certain other technical and conforming changes. In addition, Article II, Section 12 of the Amended By-Laws was added to require that all nominees for director provide certain information, representations and agreements to the Company in order to be eligible for election. 

The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended By-Laws, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
