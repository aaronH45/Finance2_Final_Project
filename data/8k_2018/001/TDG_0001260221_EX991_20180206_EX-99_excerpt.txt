TransDigm Group Reports Fiscal 2018 First Quarter Results 

Cleveland, Ohio, February 6, 2018/PRNewswire/ -- TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE: TDG), a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components, today reported results for the first quarter ended December 30, 2017.

Highlights for the first quarter include:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Adjusted earnings per share of $5.58, up 121.4% from $2.52, this includes $2.96 per share of favorable impact from tax reform; and

•Upward revision to fiscal 2018 net income and earnings per share guidance.

Net sales for the quarter rose 4.2%, or $33.9 million, to $848.0 million from $814.0 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. 

Net income from continuing operations for the quarter rose 162.5% to $312.0 million, or $4.60 per share, compared to $118.9 million, or $0.41 per share, in the comparable quarter a year ago. The current quarter included a provisional net tax benefit of $147.1 million to record the estimated impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (tax reform), primarily including a $23.1 million charge for the U.S. tax on deemed repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, more than offset by the $170.2 benefit for the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax balance. The effective tax rate for the 2018 first quarter was a benefit of 63.4% compared to a provision of 14.4% for the 2017 first quarter. The balance of the increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales described above, lower refinancing costs, lower acquisition related costs and improvements to our operating margin resulting from the strength of our proprietary products and continued productivity efforts. This growth in net income was partially offset by higher interest expense. 

Earnings per share were reduced in both 2018 and 2017 by $1.01 per share and $1.70 per share, respectively, representing dividend equivalent payments made during each quarter.

Net income from discontinued operations in the quarter was $2.8 million, or $0.05 earnings per share.

Adjusted net income for the quarter rose 117.3% to $310.1 million, or $5.58 per share, from $142.7 million, or $2.52 per share, in the comparable quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share in the current quarter included $2.96 of favorable impact from the enactment of tax reform. Excluding this favorable tax impact, current earnings per share of $2.62 increased 4.0% over the prior year.

EBITDA for the quarter increased 18.4% to $382.5 million from $323.0 million for the comparable quarter a year ago. EBITDA As Defined for the period, which excludes $1.7 million from discontinued operations, increased 5.3% to $401.5 million compared with $381.2 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 47.4%.

"We are pleased with our first quarter results. Our focused value driven operating strategy continues to generate real intrinsic shareholder value. The commercial aftermarket revenues were particularly encouraging with our commercial transport aftermarket revenues up low double-digit percent, offset slightly by lower growth in the business jet and helicopter aftermarket. As we said in the beginning of the year, we do not intend to change our guidance as long as we think the ranges are still reasonably representative," stated W. Nicholas Howley, TransDigm Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 

Subsequent to the fiscal quarter end, on January 26, 2018, TransDigm completed the sale of Schroth in a management buyout to a private equity fund and certain members of Schroth management for approximately $61 million. 

Please see the attached tables for a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, and adjusted net income; a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, and a reconciliation of earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share for the periods discussed in this press release.

Fiscal 2018 Outlook

Mr. Howley continued, "We are leaving our revenue and EBITDA guidance unchanged at this time until we see how the year is proceeding. We have significantly increased our net income and earnings per share guidance to reflect the impact of tax reform." Assuming no acquisitions and based upon current market conditions, TransDigm expects fiscal 2018 financial guidance to be as follows: 

•Net sales are anticipated to be in the range of $3,645 million to $3,725 million compared with $3,504 million in fiscal 2017;

•Net income from continuing operations is anticipated to be in the range of $906 million to $942 million compared with $629 million in fiscal 2017; 

•Earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be in the range of $15.29 to $15.93 per share based upon weighted average shares outstanding of 55.6 compared with $8.45 per share in fiscal 2017; 

•EBITDA As Defined is anticipated to be in the range of $1,805 million to $1,855 million compared with $1,711 million in fiscal 2017; and

•Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $16.95 to $17.59 per share compared with $12.38 per share in fiscal 2017.

Non-GAAP Supplemental Information

EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, EBITDA As Defined Margin, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release as supplemental disclosures to net income and reported results. TransDigm Group defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and defines EBITDA As Defined as EBITDA plus certain non-operating items, refinancing costs, acquisition-related costs, transaction-related costs and non-cash charges incurred in connection with certain employee benefit plans. TransDigm Group defines adjusted net income as net income plus purchase accounting backlog amortization expense, effects from the sale on businesses, refinancing costs, acquisition-related costs, transaction-related costs and non-cash charges incurred in connection with certain employee benefit plans. EBITDA As Defined Margin represents EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales. TransDigm Group defines adjusted diluted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the total shares for basic and diluted earnings per share. For more information regarding the computation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined and adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, please see the attached financial tables.

TransDigm Group presents these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that they are useful indicators of its operating performance. TransDigm Group believes that EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to measure operating performance among companies with different capital structures, effective tax rates and tax attributes, capitalized asset values and employee compensation structures, all of which can vary substantially from company to company. In addition, analysts, rating agencies and others use EBITDA to evaluate a company’s ability to incur and service debt. EBITDA As Defined is used to measure TransDigm Inc.’s compliance with the financial covenant contained in its credit facility. TransDigm Group’s management also uses EBITDA As Defined to review and assess its operating performance, to 

3

prepare its annual budget and financial projections and to review and evaluate its management team in connection with employee incentive programs. Moreover, TransDigm Group’s management uses EBITDA As Defined to evaluate acquisitions and as a liquidity measure. In addition, TransDigm Group’s management uses adjusted net income as a measure of comparable operating performance between time periods and among companies as it is reflective of changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance.

None of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, EBITDA As Defined Margin, adjusted net income or adjusted earnings per share is a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and such financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities or other measures of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, TransDigm Group’s calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Although we use EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

 • neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments, on our indebtedness;

 • although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements;

 • the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined;

 • neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; and

 • EBITDA As Defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions.
