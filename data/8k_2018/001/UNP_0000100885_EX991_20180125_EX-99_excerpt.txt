 *ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital investments. In addition, we currently use ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives. ROIC should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is Return on Average Common Shareholders’ Equity. The tables above provide reconciliations from return on average common shareholders’ equity to ROIC.

 * The above tables reconcile our results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 to adjusted results that exclude the impact of certain items identified as affecting comparability. We use adjusted operating income, adjusted income taxes, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share ("EPS") and adjusted operating ratio, as applicable, among other measures, to evaluate our actual operating performance. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide relevant and useful information for management and investors because they clarify our actual operating performance by excluding certain significant items that are not considered indicative of future financial trends and allow investors to review performance in the same way as our management. Since these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, operating income, income taxes, net income, diluted EPS, and operating ratio, as indicators of operating performance.
