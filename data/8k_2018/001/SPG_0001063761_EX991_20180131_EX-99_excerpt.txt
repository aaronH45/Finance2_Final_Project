      FINANCING ACTIVITY 

The Company was active in both the unsecured and secured credit markets in 2017, continuing to lower our effective borrowing costs.  

The Company completed two senior notes offerings totaling $2.7 billion, with a weighted average coupon rate of 3.07% and a weighted average term of 7.9 years.  

During 2017, and subsequent to year-end, we retired three series of senior notes comprising approximately $2.6 billion at a weighted average coupon rate of 3.65%. The two new notes offerings had a weighted average coupon rate approximately 60 basis points lower than the notes that were retired.

With regard to secured debt activity, we closed or committed on 20 mortgage loans totaling approximately $2.9 billion, (U.S. dollar equivalent), of which Simon's share is $1.8 billion. The weighted average interest rate and weighted average term on these loans is 3.37% and 6.7 years, respectively.

Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained, and it is possible that the Company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

 Footnotes to Unaudited Financial Information 

      Notes: 

(A)Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of our investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the related partnerships and joint ventures shown therein. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related properties. 

(B)The Unaudited Joint Venture Combined Statements of Operations do not include any operations or our share of net income or excess investment amortization related to our investments in Klépierre and HBS Global Properties. Amounts included in Footnotes D below exclude our share of related activity for our investments in Klépierre and HBS Global Properties. For further information on Klépierre, reference should be made to financial information in Klépierre's public filings and additional discussion and analysis in our Form 10-K. 

(C)This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by GAAP, including FFO, FFO per share, comparable FFO per share and comparable EPS. FFO is a performance measure that is standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO provides investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.   

We determine FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). We determine FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales or disposals of, or any impairment charges related to, previously depreciated retail operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.  

We have adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale or disposal of, or any impairment charges relating to, previously depreciated retail operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.    

(D)Includes our share of: 

-Gains on land sales of $2.2 million and $8.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $12.3 million and $14.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

-Straight-line adjustments increased income by $7.4 million and $12.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $34.5 million and $56.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.   

  4Q 2017 SUPPLEMENTAL      13    

Table of Contents   

-Amortization of fair market value of leases from acquisitions increased income by $1.4 million and $2.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $6.0 million and $9.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

-Debt premium amortization of $0.0 million and $5.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $0.2 million and $19.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

(E)Gain upon acquisition of controlling interests and sale or disposal of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $8.1 million and $84.6 million, respectively. Noncontrolling interest portion of the gain for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $0.0 million and $4.4 million, respectively. 

(F)Includes noncontrolling interests gain upon acquisition of controlling interests and sale or disposal of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities of $0.01 per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. 

(G)Includes a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $128.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Includes a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $136.8 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016. 

(H)Includes Basic and Diluted FFO per share related to a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $0.36 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Includes Basic and Diluted FFO per share related to a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $0.38 for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016.

      NON-GAAP PRO-RATA FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

The following pro-rata financial information is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP pro-rata financial information aggregates our proportionate economic ownership of each asset in our property portfolio that we do not wholly own. The amounts in the column labeled "Our Share of Joint Ventures" were derived on a property-by-property or entity-by-entity basis by applying to each line item the ownership percentage interest used to arrive at our share of the net operations for the period consistent with the application of the equity method of accounting to each of our unconsolidated joint ventures. A similar calculation was performed for the amounts in the column labeled "Noncontrolling Interests," which represents the share of consolidated assets and net income or loss attributable to any noncontrolling interest.  

We do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures and the presentations of the assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items. The operating agreements of the unconsolidated joint ventures generally provide that partners may receive cash distributions (1) to the extent there is available cash from operations, (2) upon a capital event, such as a refinancing or sale or (3) upon liquidation of the venture. The amount of cash each partner receives is based upon specific provisions of each operating agreement and varies depending on factors including the amount of capital contributed by each partner and whether any contributions are entitled to priority distributions. Upon liquidation of the joint venture and after all liabilities, priority distributions and initial equity contributions have been repaid, the partners generally would be entitled to any residual cash remaining based on their respective legal ownership percentages.  

We provide pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our unconsolidated joint ventures when read in conjunction with the Company's reported results under GAAP. The presentation of pro-rata financial information has limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations include:  

• The amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities, or the revenues and expenses; and  

• Other companies in our industry may calculate their pro-rata interest differently than we do, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure.  

Because of these limitations, the pro-rata financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using the pro-rata financial information only supplementally.
