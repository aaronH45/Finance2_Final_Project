DANAHER REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2017 RESULTS

WASHINGTON, D.C., January 30, 2018 -- Danaher Corporation (NYSE: DHR) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net earnings were $856.6 million, or $1.21 per diluted share which represents a 13.0% year-over-year increase.

Non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $1.19. This represents a 13.5% increase over the comparable 2016 period. For the fourth quarter 2017, revenues increased 11.0% year-over-year to $5.1 billion, with non-GAAP core revenue growth of 5.5%.

For the full year 2017, net earnings were $2.5 billion, or $3.50 per diluted share which represents a 13.5% year-over-year increase. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share for 2017 was $4.03 per share, which represents an 11.5% increase over the comparable 2016 amount. Revenues for the full year 2017 increased 8.5% to $18.3 billion, with non-GAAP core revenue growth of 3.5%. The Company generated strong operating cash flow of $3.5 billion for the full year 2017.

For the first quarter of 2018, the Company anticipates that diluted net earnings per share will be in the range of $0.71 to $0.74 and non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share will be in the range of $0.90 to $0.93.

For the full year 2018, the Company anticipates that diluted net earnings per share will be in the range of $3.50 to $3.60. The Company continues to expect its 2018 non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.35.

Thomas P. Joyce, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are very pleased with our strong fourth quarter results. The team delivered 5.5% core revenue growth, solid margin expansion, and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. As we reflect back, 2017 was a year of accelerating revenue growth, solid margin improvement, continued growth investment, and great performance at our more recently acquired larger businesses. In addition, mid-teens growth in free cash flow helps position us for more significant capital deployment in 2018.” 

Joyce continued, “As we look ahead, we believe that the strength of our portfolio, combined with the power of the Danaher Business System, provide us with the foundation for long-term shareholder value creation.”

1 The forward-looking estimates set forth above do not reflect future gains and charges that are inherently difficult to predict and estimate due to their unknown timing, effect and/or significance, such as certain future gains or losses on the sale of investments, acquisition or divestiture-related gains or charges and discrete tax items.

Revenue Performance

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2 We use the term “core revenue” to refer to GAAP revenue from continuing operations excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to divested businesses or product lines not considered discontinued operations (“acquisition sales”) and (2) the impact of currency translation. The portion of GAAP revenue from continuing operations attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. We use the term “core revenue growth” to refer to the measure of comparing current period core revenue with the corresponding period of the prior year.

A Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in the following historical and forecasted periods ($ in millions) (only the pretax amounts set forth below are reflected in the amortization line item above):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

B Net gains on resolution of acquisition-related matters in the Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments ($11 million pretax as presented in this line item, $8 million after-tax) for the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2017.

C Gains on resolution of acquisition-related matters ($18 million pretax as presented in this line item, $14 million after-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2016.

D Gain on sales of investments in the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2017 ($73 million pretax as presented in this line item, $46 million after-tax).

E Gain on sales of investments in the year ended December 31, 2016 ($223 million pretax as presented in this line item, $140 million after-tax).

F During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $76 million of pretax restructuring, impairment and other related charges ($51 million after-tax) primarily related to the Company’s strategic decision to discontinue a molecular diagnostic product line in its Diagnostics segment. As a result, the Company incurred noncash charges for the impairment of certain technology-related intangibles as well as related inventory and plant, property and equipment with no further use totaling $49 million. In addition, the Company incurred cash restructuring costs primarily related to employee severance and related charges totaling $27 million. This is addressed in more detail in the “Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures.”

G Charge for early extinguishment of borrowings ($179 million pretax as presented in this line item, $112 million after-tax) incurred in the third quarter of 2016. 

H Acquisition-related transaction costs deemed significant ($12 million pretax as presented in this line item, $9 million after-tax), change in control payments and restructuring costs ($49 million pretax as presented in this line item, $30 million after-tax), and fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue ($23 million pretax as presented in this line item, $14 million after-tax), in each case related to the acquisitions of Cepheid and Phenomenex and incurred in the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2016. The Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company’s larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for Danaher in a given period.

I This line item reflects the aggregate tax effect of all nontax adjustments reflected in the table above. In addition, the footnotes above indicate the after-tax amount of each individual adjustment item. Danaher estimates the tax effect of the adjustment items identified in the reconciliation schedule above by applying Danaher’s overall estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount, unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment, in which case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment.

J Discrete tax adjustments and other tax-related adjustments for the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2017 include:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Represents (1) discrete income tax gains, primarily related to expiration of statute of limitations ($94 million in the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 and $129 million in the year ended December 31, 2017), (2) equity compensation-related excess tax benefits ($16 million in the year ended December 31, 2017), (3) remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, net related to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ($1.2 billion gain in the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2017), and (4) transition tax on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings in connection with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ($1.2 billion provision in the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2017).

On January 1, 2017, Danaher adopted the updated accounting guidance required by ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation, which requires income statement recognition of all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to equity compensation. We exclude from Adjusted Diluted Net EPS any excess tax benefits that exceed the levels we believe are representative of historical experience. In the first quarter of 2017, we anticipated $10 million of equity compensation-related excess tax benefits and realized $26 million of excess tax benefits, and therefore we have excluded $16 million of these benefits in the calculation of Adjusted Diluted Net

Earnings per Share. In the second, third and fourth quarters of 2017, realized equity compensation-related excess tax benefits approximated the anticipated benefit and no adjustments were required. 

K Discrete income tax gains net of discrete income tax charges incurred in the three-month period ended December 31, 2016 ($190 million). Discrete income tax gains net of discrete income tax charges and Fortive separation-related tax costs related to repatriation of earnings and legal entity realignments incurred in the year ended December 31, 2016 ($91 million). 

Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures

Each of the non-GAAP measures set forth above should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing Danaher Corporation’s (“Danaher” or the “Company”) results that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, help our investors to:

•with respect to Adjusted Diluted Net EPS, understand the long-term profitability trends of our business and compare our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers; and 

•with respect to core revenue, identify underlying growth trends in our business and compare our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers.

Management uses these non-GAAP measures to measure the Company’s operating and financial performance, and uses a non-GAAP measure similar to Adjusted Diluted Net EPS in the Company’s executive compensation program. 

The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures set forth above have been excluded for the following reasons:

•With respect to Adjusted Diluted Net EPS:

◦We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe however that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation and that intangible asset amortization related to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized.

◦We exclude costs incurred pursuant to discrete restructuring plans that are fundamentally different (in terms of the size, strategic nature and planning requirements, as well as the inconsistent frequency, of such plans) from the ongoing productivity improvements that result from application of the Danaher Business System. Because these restructuring plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business and we believe are not indicative of Danaher’s ongoing operating costs in a given period, we exclude these costs from the calculation of Adjusted Diluted Net EPS to facilitate a more consistent comparison of operating results over time.

◦With respect to the other items excluded from Adjusted Diluted Net EPS, we exclude these items because they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency, occur for reasons that may be unrelated to Danaher’s commercial performance during the period and/or we believe are not indicative of Danaher’s ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period; we believe that such items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.

•With respect to core revenue, (1) we exclude the impact of currency translation because it is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and (2) we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divested product lines because the timing, size, number and nature of such transactions can vary significantly from period-to-period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
