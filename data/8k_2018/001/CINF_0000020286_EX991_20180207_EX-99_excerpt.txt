 CINF 4Q17 Release 1

Insurance Operations Fourth-Quarter Highlights

•92.9 percent fourth-quarter 2017 property casualty combined ratio, down from 96.2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016. Full-year 2017 property casualty combined ratio at 97.5 percent, with net written premiums up 6 percent.

•6 percent increase in fourth-quarter 2017 net written premiums, reflecting price increases and premium growth initiatives.

•$151 million fourth-quarter 2017 property casualty new business written premiums. Agencies appointed since the beginning of 2016 contributed $23 million or 15 percent of total fourth-quarter new business written premiums. 

•$106 million increase in fourth-quarter 2017 life insurance subsidiary net income, including a $111 million benefit from revaluation of deferred income taxes due to tax reform, and 11 percent growth in life insurance earned premiums.

Investment and Balance Sheet Highlights 

•2 percent or $3 million rise in fourth-quarter 2017 pretax investment income, including 5 percent growth for stock portfolio dividends and 1 percent growth for bond interest income. 

•10 percent full-year increase in fair value of total investments at December 31, 2017, including a 17 percent increase for the stock portfolio and a 6 percent increase for the bond portfolio.

•$2.511 billion parent company cash and marketable securities at year-end 2017, up 18 percent from a year ago. 

Fourth-Quarter Improves Full-Year Results

Steven J. Johnston, president and chief executive officer, commented: “Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter rose 22 percent over last year’s result, bringing our full-year non-GAAP operating income to $455 million. Full-year 2017 net income rose 77 percent to $1.045 billion, including a $495 million benefit related to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

“After one of the highest catastrophe losses for any recent third-quarter for our company, fourth-quarter catastrophe losses swung the other way – decreasing 6.2 points compared with fourth-quarter 2016 – and improving our property casualty insurance full-year results. A fourth-quarter combined ratio of 92.9 percent helped improve our combined ratio from 99.1 percent at nine months to 97.5 percent for the full-year. Underwriting profits before taxes increased 91 percent for the quarter and helped us earn a 2017 full-year underwriting profit of $128 million.

“Our fourth-quarter and full-year combined ratios also included higher paid losses and some areas of higher reserve estimates of losses and loss expenses not yet paid for our commercial casualty line of business. While our commercial casualty line achieved an underwriting profit in 2017, we felt it was prudent to record higher reserves for estimated losses in this line. Development for all lines in total remained favorable for the full year, advancing our record of net favorable property casualty reserve development to 29 years as we continue to follow our consistent reserving practices.” 

Focused, Profitable Growth

“For the first time, full-year new business premiums written with our independent agencies exceeded $600 million. Property casualty net written premium growth continued to reach our target, increasing 6 percent, compared with full-year 2016, to $4.8 billion and rising for each of our property casualty insurance segments for both the fourth quarter and the full year. 

“We continue our careful, measured expansion of our product lines, marketing territories and independent agency force, with an eye toward gradual geographic diversification of our premium sources. During the fourth quarter, net written premiums from our excess and surplus lines operation, launched in 2008, passed the $200 million mark. Our initiatives to attract more of our agents’ high net worth clients and to grow our reinsurance assumed division, Cincinnati ReSM, continued on track, both increasing property casualty net written premiums. 

“We continue to make strides toward pricing precision, using models and agent-provided information to identify the right price for new business and to take action on selected renewal accounts to improve price adequacy. During the fourth quarter, commercial lines policies and excess and surplus lines business that renewed had price percentage increases that averaged in the low-single-digits; price increases averaged in the high-single-digits for personal auto renewals and in the mid-single-digits for homeowner policies.”

Confidence in the Future

“The U.S. tax reform recently passed by Congress enhances our optimism for the future of Cincinnati Financial. Not only does it create a more level playing field for domestic insurers, it also amplifies the advantages of our equity investment strategy. For full-year 2017, our annual equity portfolio total return was 21 percent, increasing our total equity portfolio fair value to $6.249 billion.

“At December 31, 2017, our book value climbed 17 percent to $50.29 bolstered by record pretax investment income of $609 million. The board of directors’ recent decision to increase the cash dividend demonstrates their confidence in the future success of our strategies and sets the stage for a 58th consecutive year of increasing regular annual dividends.”

The company also is subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for its common stock, such as measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation to Comparable GAAP Measures

(See attached tables for reconciliations; additional prior-period reconciliations available at cinfin.com/investors.)

Cincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data. 

Management uses certain non-GAAP and non-statutory financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas – property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP measures to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of management’s control; supplement reporting segment disclosures with disclosures for a subsidiary company or for a combination of subsidiaries or reporting segments; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis. 

•Non-GAAP operating income: Non-GAAP operating income is calculated by excluding net realized investment gains and losses (defined as realized investment gains and losses after applicable federal and state income taxes) and other significant non-recurring items from net income. Management evaluates non-GAAP operating income to measure the success of pricing, rate and underwriting strategies. While realized investment gains (or losses) are integral to the company’s insurance operations over the long term, the determination to realize investment gains or losses in any period may be subject to management’s discretion and is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Also, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, gains and losses can be recognized from certain 

 CINF 4Q17 Release 14

changes in market values of securities without actual realization. Management believes that the level of realized investment gains or losses for any particular period, while it may be material, may not fully indicate the performance of ongoing underlying business operations in that period. 

For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider non-GAAP operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents non-GAAP operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information. 

•Value creation ratio: This is a measure of shareholder value creation that management believes captures the contribution of the company’s insurance operations, the success of its investment strategy and the importance placed on paying cash dividends to shareholders. The value creation ratio measure is made up of two primary components: (1) rate of growth in book value per share plus (2) the ratio of dividends declared per share to beginning book value per share. Management believes this non-GAAP measure is a useful supplement to GAAP information, providing a meaningful measure of long-term progress in creating shareholder value. It is intended to be all-inclusive regarding changes in book value per share, and uses originally reported book value per share in cases where book value per share has been adjusted, such as adoption of Accounting Standards Updates with a cumulative effect of a change in accounting.

•Consolidated property casualty insurance results: To supplement reporting segment disclosures related to our property casualty insurance operations, we also evaluate results for those operations on a basis that includes results for our property casualty insurance and brokerage services subsidiaries. That is the total of our commercial lines, personal lines and our excess and surplus lines segment plus our reinsurance assumed operations. 

•Life insurance subsidiary results: To supplement life insurance reporting segment disclosures related to our life insurance operation, we also evaluate results for that operation on a basis that includes life insurance subsidiary investment income, or investment income plus net realized investment gains, that are also included in our investments reporting segment. We recognize that assets under management, capital appreciation and investment income are integral to evaluating the success of the life insurance segment because of the long duration of life products. 

•Statutory accounting rules: For public reporting, insurance companies prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, insurers also must calculate certain data according to statutory accounting rules as defined in the NAIC’s Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, which may be, and has been, modified by various state insurance departments. Statutory data is publicly available, and various organizations use it to calculate aggregate industry data, study industry trends and compare insurance companies. 

•Written premium: Under statutory accounting rules, property casualty written premium is the amount recorded for policies issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Management analyzes trends in written premium to assess business efforts. Earned premium, used in both statutory and GAAP accounting, is calculated ratably over the policy term. The difference between written and earned premium is unearned premium.
