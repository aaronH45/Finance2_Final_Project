EXPLANATORY NOTE  

As previously reported by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) in a Current Report on Form 8-K (“Initial Form 8-K”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 10, 2018, Berkshire reported that on January 9, 2018, Gregory E. Abel and Ajit Jain were elected to Berkshire’s Board of Directors. Item 9.01 to the Initial Form 8-K included a press release issued by Berkshire on January 10, 2018, which in addition to announcing that Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain had been elected to Berkshire’s Board of Directors also announced that Mr. Abel had been appointed Berkshire’s Vice Chairman – Non Insurance Operations and Mr. Jain had been appointed Vice Chairman – Insurance Operations.  

This Amendment No. 1 on Form 8-K/A is being filed by Berkshire to amend the Initial Form 8-K, solely to provide the disclosures required by Item 5.02(c) that were not previously filed with the Initial Form 8-K. Except as provided herein, the disclosures in the Initial Form 8-K remain unchanged.  

ITEM 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers  

On January 9, 2018, Gregory E. Abel, age 55, was elected to be an Executive Officer of Berkshire as its Vice Chairman – Non Insurance Operations. Mr. Abel joined Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), a 90.2% owned subsidiary of Berkshire, in 1992 and since 2011 has been BHE’s Chairman and CEO. Mr. Abel currently serves as a Director of The Kraft Heinz Company, a manufacturer and marketer of food and beverage products, and AEGIS Insurance Services, Inc., a provider of property and liability insurance for the energy industry, and Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, an insurer of nuclear power utilities.  

Additionally, on January 9, 2018, Ajit Jain, age 66, was elected to be an Executive Officer of Berkshire as its Vice Chairman – Insurance Operations. Mr. Jain joined Berkshire’s insurance group in 1986 and since 1996 has been Executive Vice President of National Indemnity Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire. Mr. Jain currently serves as a Trustee of Rockefeller University, a leading biomedical research university.  

Both Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain possess the attributes the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee of Berkshire’s Board of Directors as well as Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett, consider to be essential if one is to be an effective Board member. Specifically, both Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain have integrity, business savvy, an owner-oriented attitude and a deep genuine interest in Berkshire. These attributes have been evident during each of their careers as leaders of two of Berkshire’s most important business groups.
