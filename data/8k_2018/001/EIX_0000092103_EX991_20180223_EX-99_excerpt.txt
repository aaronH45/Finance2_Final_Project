February 23, 2018 1 Statements contained in this presentation about future performance, including, without limitation, operating results, capital expenditures, rate base growth, dividend policy, financial outlook, and other statements that are not purely historical, are forward- looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations; however, such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of the date of this presentation, and Edison International assumes no duty to update them to reflect new information, events or circumstances. Important factors that could cause different results include, but are not limited to the: • ability of SCE to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates, including costs related to San Onofre, uninsured wildfire-related liabilities, and spending on grid modernization; • ability to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost, including insurance relating to SCE's nuclear facilities and wildfire- related exposure, and to recover the costs of such insurance or, in the absence of insurance, the ability to recover uninsured losses; • decisions and other actions by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC and other regulatory authorities, including determinations of authorized rates of return or return on equity, the 2018 GRC and the recoverability of wildfire-related costs, and delays in regulatory actions; • risks associated with the decommissioning of San Onofre, including those related to public opposition, permitting, governmental approvals, on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, and cost overruns; • extreme weather-related incidents and other natural disasters, including earthquakes and events caused, or exacerbated, by climate change, such as wildfires; • risks associated with higher rates for utility bundled service customers because of possible customer bypass or departure due to Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs); and • risks inherent in SCE’s transmission and distribution infrastructure investment program, including those related to project site identification, public opposition, environmental mitigation, construction, permitting, power curtailment costs (payments due under power contracts in the event there is insufficient transmission to enable acceptance of power delivery), changes in the CAISO’s plan, and governmental approvals. Other important factors are discussed under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” in Edison International’s Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on our website: www.edisoninvestor.com. These filings also provide additional information on historical and other factual data contained in this presentation. Forward-Looking Statements

February 23, 2018 11 SCE Rate Base Forecast Updates ($ billions) *Note: Numbers may not foot due to rounding. Incentive CWIP Approval at FERC for Mesa, Alberhill and Eldorado-Lugo-Mohave accelerates the inclusion of capital spend into FERC rate base. Previously projects would have accrued AFUDC until project in-service date and then become part of rate base. FERC Capital Changes reflects impacts of latest capital forecast. Permanent capital efficiencies related to SCE’s transmission line remediation program make up approximately $0.2 of the $0.6 billion reduction by 2020. The remainder is primarily due to timing of major project spend.

Management uses core earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings are also used when communicating with investors and analysts regarding Edison International's earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. Core earnings are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings (or losses) are defined as earnings or losses attributable to Edison International shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as: exit activities, including sale of certain assets, and other activities that are no longer continuing; asset impairments and certain tax, regulatory or legal settlements or proceedings. A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in this presentation.
