 ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS  

On February 20, 2018, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of American Airlines Group Inc. (the “Company”) approved an amendment (the “Charter Amendment”) to the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and recommended that the stockholders approve the Charter Amendment at the Company’s 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, expected to be held in June 2018. If approved by stockholders, the Charter Amendment will remove the existing prohibition on the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and instead permit stockholders who hold, in the aggregate, at least 20% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company to call a special meeting of stockholders. The existing Restated Certificate of Incorporation will remain in effect unless and until stockholders approve the Charter Amendment.  

Also on February 20, 2018, the Board approved the Third Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Restated Bylaws”) to establish the procedural and disclosure requirements in connection with permitting stockholders who hold, in the aggregate, at least 20% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company to call a special meeting of stockholders. The effectiveness of the Restated Bylaws is subject to and conditioned upon the approval of the Charter Amendment by the stockholders at the annual meeting. The Company’s current Bylaws will remain in effect unless and until stockholders approve the Charter Amendment.  

The foregoing descriptions are qualified by reference to the forms of such proposed amendments, which are filed as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, to this current report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference. Exhibit 99.2 is blacklined to show the amendments reflected in the Restated Bylaws as compared to the existing Bylaws.
