Item 8.01 Other Events.

Kimberly-Clark Corporation ("Kimberly-Clark" or "the Corporation") is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K ("Current Report") to recast certain prior period financial information related to Kimberly-Clark’s adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost ("ASU No. 2017-07") and the classification of costs associated with sales of K-C Professional (“KCP”) dispensers. The recast has no impact on Kimberly-Clark's earnings or earnings per share in any period. Beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2018, Kimberly-Clark's financial information will reflect these changes with prior periods adjusted accordingly.

We also adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective January 1, 2018, with no material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Accordingly, we did not recast prior periods for the adoption of this accounting standard update. 

In 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued ASU No. 2017-07. The standard requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside of operating profit. Prior periods are required to be recast. The Corporation adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018. Components of net benefit costs other than service costs were $59 million, $66 million, $1,425 million and $98 million in 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

In prior years, Kimberly-Clark followed an accounting practice whereby costs associated with sales of KCP dispensers were classified as a reduction in revenue, similar to sales incentives. Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation changed this practice and now classifies these costs as cost of products sold. This change results in an immaterial increase in net sales and cost of products sold of $89 million, $85 million, $91 million and $93 million in 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and all periods presented herein have been recast accordingly. 

This Current Report and Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2 are being filed to recast certain financial information as described above. No part of Exhibit 99.1 or Exhibit 99.2 has otherwise been updated to reflect events subsequent to the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. The information in this Current Report shall be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as otherwise expressly stated in such filing. 

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
