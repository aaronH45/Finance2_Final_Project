Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

On January 30, 2018, Juniper Networks, Inc. (“we”, “our” or the “Company”) issued a press release in which we announced preliminary financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Company also posted on the Investor Relations section of its website (www.juniper.net) prepared remarks with respect to the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Copies of the press release and prepared remarks by the Company are furnished as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, to this report. Information on our website is not, and will not be deemed, a part of this report or incorporated into any other filings the Company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

The information furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, shall not be deemed as “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.  

Item 8.01 Other Events.  

On January 25, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new stock repurchase program granting the Company authority to repurchase up to $2 billion in our common stock. Under our new stock repurchase program, we may repurchase shares in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means, including through repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and through derivative, accelerated share repurchase and other structured transactions, in each case, at such prices and times and upon such other terms and conditions as any authorized officer of the Company may determine. The timing and exact amount of any share repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions and the trading price of our common stock; the Company’s capital position, liquidity and financial performance; alternative uses of capital; and legal and regulatory considerations. This new stock repurchase program replaces all previously authorized stock repurchase programs. A copy of the press release announcing our new stock repurchase program is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3 and is incorporated herein by reference.
