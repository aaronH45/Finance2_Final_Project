Andeavor Non-GAAP Financial Measures 31 Our management uses certain “non-GAAP” operational measures to analyze operating segment performance and “non-GAAP” financial measures to evaluate past performance and prospects for the future to supplement our financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). These financial and operational non-GAAP measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: • EBITDA—GAAP-based net earnings before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expenses; • Segment EBITDA—a segment’s GAAP-based operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses plus equity in earnings (loss) of equity method investments and other income (expense), net; • Marketing margin—Marketing segment’s GAAP-based operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses, general and administrative expenses, operating expenses and gains or losses from asset disposals or impairments; • Fuel margin—Marketing segment’s GAAP-based operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses, general and administrative expenses, operating expenses, gains or losses from asset disposals or impairments and convenience margin divided by our total fuel sales volumes in gallons multiplied by 100 (to achieve cents per gallon); • Convenience margin—Marketing segment’s GAAP-based operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses, general and administrative expenses, operating expenses, gains or losses from asset disposals or impairments and fuel margin; • Merchandise margin—the difference between merchandise sales and purchases of merchandise divided by merchandise sales; • Refining margin—the difference between total refining revenues and total cost of materials and other (excluding lower of cost or market adjustments and depreciation and amortization expenses); • Manufacturing costs—manufacturing costs excluding depreciation and amortization expenses divided by our average daily refining throughput in barrels multiplied by 1,000, and then further multiplied by the number of days in the period (representing direct operating expenses incurred by our Refining segment for the production of refined products); • Adjusted CFO—GAAP-based cash flows from operating activities before turnaround expenditures and marketing branding costs; and • Integrated contribution—the sum of refining margin and segment EBITDA from our Marketing and Logistics segments divided by our average daily refining throughput in barrels multiplied by 1,000, and then further multiplied by the number of days in the period. We present these measures because we believe they may help investors, analysts, lenders and ratings agencies analyze our results of operations and liquidity in conjunction with our GAAP results, including but not limited to: • our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the marketing, logistics and refining industries, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods; • our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and • the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” below for reconciliations between non-GAAP measures and their most directly comparable GAAP measures.
