Explanatory Note

On November 21, 2017, Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (the “Company”) issued a press release announcing that Richard D. Maltsbarger had been promoted to the position of Chief Operating Officer, effective February 3, 2018. On November 21, 2017, the Company filed a current report on Form 8-K to report this event. This Amendment provides additional information required by Item 5.02(c)(3) of Form 8-K that was not included in the Company’s current report on Form 8-K filed on November 21, 2017. The disclosure included in the current report on Form 8-K filed November 21, 2017 otherwise remains unchanged.

Item 5.02.Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

As part of its annual review of executive compensation on January 25, 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, determined that, in connection with his appointment to Chief Operating Officer effective February 3, 2018, Mr. Maltsbarger will receive an annual base salary of $725,000 and will be eligible for an annual cash-based, short-term incentive for fiscal 2018 with a target incentive opportunity of 100% of his base salary. Subject to his continued employment, in fiscal 2018 he will be granted equity-based awards under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan having a value of 450% of his base salary and on other terms consistent with the awards granted to the Company’s other executive officers. He also will be eligible for benefits available to executive officers generally, as outlined in the Company’s proxy statement filed on April 21, 2017.

The actual value of the awards realized by Mr. Maltsbarger (as well as the Company’s other executive officers) will be based on the degree of achievement of performance vesting goals or satisfaction of vesting requirements based on continued employment with the Company and the value of the Company’s common stock when the awards are earned and become vested.
