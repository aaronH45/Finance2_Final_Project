Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On January 24, 2018, Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the “Company”) announced its 2017 fourth quarter results of operations in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company presents certain financial measures excluding the impact of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" in the fourth quarter of 2017

and the benefit of a legal settlement in fiscal year 2017. These non-GAAP measures are consistent with the way management analyzes

and assesses the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures enhance investors’

understanding of the Company’s underlying financial performance, as well as their ability to compare the Company’s financial results

and overall performance to that of its peers. A reconciliation of the impact of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" and legal settlement is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

The Company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures the Company's ability to generate cash internally to fund Company initiatives. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. Free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.

The Company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") to measure the effectiveness of its operations’ use of invested capital to generate profits. ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. Adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the Company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the Company's operations, as well as the Company's equity investment in the Wilsonart business (formerly the Decorative Surfaces segment). Average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. A calculation of ROIC is included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
