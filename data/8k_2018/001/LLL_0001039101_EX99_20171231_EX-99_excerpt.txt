NEW YORK, January 25, 2018 – L3 Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: LLL) today reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $3.34  for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (2017 fourth quarter) compared to diluted EPS from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 (2016 fourth quarter) of $2.32. The 2017 fourth quarter results included an estimated tax benefit of $79 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform) in December 2017. Net sales of $2,574 million for the 2017 fourth quarter decreased by 3% compared to the 2016 fourth quarter. The prior period results have been adjusted to present the Vertex Aerospace business as discontinued operations. 

“We had solid performance in 2017, with increases in every key performance metric, including sales, operating income and free cash flow,” said Christopher E. Kubasik, L3’s Chief Executive Officer and President. “As we continue to execute our strategy, we will enhance our profitability by integrating businesses to increase efficiencies and investing in emerging technologies.

L3 Consolidated Results 

The table below provides L3’s selected financial data.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth Quarter Results of Operations: For the 2017 fourth quarter, consolidated net sales of $2,574 million decreased $69 million, or 3%, compared to the 2016 fourth quarter. Organic sales(1) decreased by $95 million, or 4%, to $2,532 million for the 2017 fourth quarter. Organic sales exclude $42 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions and $16 million of sales declines related to business divestitures. For the 2017 fourth quarter, organic sales to the U.S. Government increased $7 million, or less than 1% to $1,787 million, and organic sales to international and commercial customers decreased $102 million, or 12%, to $745 million. 

Due to the calendarization of the Company’s fiscal quarter end dates, the 2017 fourth quarter had 7% less business days compared to the 2016 fourth quarter. 

Operating income for the 2017 fourth quarter decreased by $19 million, or 7%, compared to the 2016 fourth quarter. Operating income as a percentage of sales (operating margin) decreased by 50 basis points to 10.2% for the 2017 fourth quarter, compared to 10.7% for the 2016 fourth quarter. Operating margin decreased by 150 basis points due to severance and restructuring costs of $39 million, including a $12 million non-cash loss on the sale of a building in Sensor Systems and a $4 million pension curtailment charge in connection with the decision to discontinue future service accruals for substantially all salaried employee defined benefit plans effective January 1, 2019 (Pension Curtailment). These decreases were partially offset by 100 basis points primarily due to improved contract performance for the Electronic Systems,  

(1) Organic sales represent net sales excluding the sales impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Sales declines related to business divestitures are sales from divestitures that are included in L3’s actual results for the 12 months prior to the divestitures. Sales increases related to acquired businesses are sales from acquisitions that are included in L3’s actual results for less than 12 months. The company believes organic sales is a useful measure for investors because it provides period-to-period comparisons of the company’s ongoing operational and financial performance.

Aerospace Systems and Communication Systems segments. See the reportable segment results for additional discussion of sales and operating margin trends. 

The effective tax rate for the 2017 fourth quarter was a benefit of 19.9% compared to a provision of 22.4% for the 2016 fourth quarter. The decrease was driven by: (1) $79 million of estimated tax benefits related to U.S. Tax Reform and (2) $30 million of tax benefits from a realignment of foreign legal entities to conform with the reporting structure (Legal Realignment). These increases were partially offset by lower tax benefits related to domestic production activities deductions and the U.S. Federal research and experimentation tax credits.  

Full Year Results of Operations: For the year ended December 31, 2017, consolidated net sales of $9,573 million increased $363 million, or 4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Organic sales increased by $213 million, or 2%, to $9,369 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Organic sales exclude $204 million of sales increases related to business acquisitions and $54 million of sales declines related to business divestitures. For the year ended December 31, 2017, organic sales to the U.S. Government increased $288 million, or 5%, to $6,642 million, and organic sales to international and commercial customers decreased $75 million, or 3%, to $2,727 million. 

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $63 million, or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating margin increased by 30 basis points to 10.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating margin was driven by: (1) 60 basis points primarily due to improved contract performance for Electronic Systems, Communication Systems and Sensor Systems and (2) 30 basis points at Sensor Systems for a settlement of the class action litigation and product return allowances recorded in 2016 that did not recur. These increases were partially offset by 60 basis points due to severance and restructuring costs of $59 million, including a $12 million non-cash loss on the sale of a building in Sensor Systems and the Pension Curtailment. See the reportable segment results for additional discussion of sales and operating margin trends. 

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to 11.7% from 21.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was driven by: (1) $79 million of estimated tax benefits related to U.S. Tax Reform and (2) $30 million of tax benefits from the Legal Realignment. These increases were partially offset by $21 million for the reversal of previously accrued amounts related to various U.S. Federal, foreign and state tax matters in 2016 that did not recur. 

Diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 20% to $9.46 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.86 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Diluted EPS for 2017 included $0.99 of estimated tax benefits related to U.S. Tax Reform. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to changes in the dilutive impact of common share equivalents, primarily caused by a higher L3 stock price. 

Orders: Funded orders for the 2017 fourth quarter decreased 10% to $2,734 million compared to $3,043 million for the 2016 fourth quarter. Funded orders for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 5% to $9,996 million compared to $9,520 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The book-to-bill ratio was 1.06x for the 2017 fourth quarter and 1.04x for the year ended December 31, 2017. Funded backlog increased 6% to $8,879 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $8,380 million at December 31, 2016.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth Quarter: Aerospace Systems net sales for the 2017 fourth quarter decreased by $1 million compared to the 2016 fourth quarter.

These decreases were partially offset by $79 million primarily due to higher volume for ISR systems to the U.S. Government.  

Aerospace Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $45 million, or 18%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating margin decreased by 110 basis points to 7.6%.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth Quarter: Communication Systems net sales for the 2017 fourth quarter increased by $19 million, or 3%, compared to the 2016 fourth quarter, primarily driven by Broadband Communication Systems due to increased deliveries of secure networked communication systems primarily for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).
