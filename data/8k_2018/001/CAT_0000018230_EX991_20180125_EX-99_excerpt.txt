•Fourth-quarter sales and revenues up 35 percent 

•Broad-based sales recovery gained momentum in the fourth quarter of 2017

•Fourth-quarter 2017 results include a charge of $2.4 billion, or $3.91 per share, from U.S. tax reform legislation 

•Expect growth in many end markets in 2018 

•Implementing new strategy focused on operational excellence and profitable growth

DEERFIELD, Ill. - Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) today announced fourth-quarter and full-year results for 2017. 

Sales and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $12.9 billion, compared with $9.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth-quarter 2017 loss was $2.18 per share, compared with a loss of $2.00 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Full-year sales and revenues in 2017 were $45.5 billion, up about 18 percent from $38.5 billion in 2016. Full-year profit was $1.26 per share in 2017, compared with a loss of $0.11 per share in 2016.

Adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.16, compared with fourth-quarter 2016 adjusted profit per share of $0.83. Adjusted profit per share in 2017 was $6.88, compared with 2016 adjusted profit per share of $3.42.

Adjusted profit per share excludes several large adjustments consisting of the impact of U.S. tax reform, restructuring costs, mark-to-market losses for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans, state deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments, a gain on sale of an equity investment in 2017 and a goodwill impairment charge in 2016. A discussion of these items is included in Q&A #1 on page 14. 

Caterpillar’s financial position continued to strengthen in the fourth quarter. Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) operating cash flow was $1.3 billion during the fourth quarter of 2017 and $5.5 billion for the full year of 2017. The ME&T debt-to-capital ratio was 36.7 percent at the end of 2017, compared to 41.0 percent at the end of 2016. The company

ended 2017 with an enterprise cash balance of $8.3 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company made a discretionary contribution to U.S. pension plans of $1.0 billion and a payment for early debt retirement of $958 million.

“After four challenging years, many key markets improved in 2017, and our global team delivered strong results. We remained focused on operational excellence and made early investments in profitable growth initiatives as we began to implement our new strategy,” said Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby.

2018 Outlook 

Caterpillar is beginning 2018 with strong sales momentum resulting from strong order rates, lean dealer inventories and an increasing backlog. Additionally, there are positive economic indicators across most of the world and in many of the company’s end markets. Caterpillar is preparing its factories and suppliers to be ready for continued growth, while remaining focused on managing with a flexible and competitive cost structure that should enable the company to respond quickly if economic fundamentals change.

The company expects 2018 profit per share in a range of $7.75 to $8.75. Excluding restructuring costs of about $400 million, adjusted profit per share is expected in a range of $8.25 to $9.25. 

"We are in the early stages of implementing our strategy for profitable growth. In 2018, we expect to make additional investments in the expanded offerings and services important for Caterpillar’s long-term success. We will use our Operating & Execution Model to bias resources to areas that represent the greatest opportunity for return on our investments,” said Umpleby.

“Our focus on operational excellence will not waver as we work to develop a more competitive and flexible cost structure, including implementing lean manufacturing principles. We are positioned to capitalize on continued sales momentum or quickly adjust should conditions change,” added Umpleby.

Following is a summary of the key drivers of sales assumptions included in the outlook:

Construction Industries - The company expects growth in 2018 with some tempering in the latter part of the year, largely due to anticipated seasonality of sales in China. Caterpillar expects improvement in North American residential, non-residential and infrastructure. The outlook does not include any impact from a potential U.S. infrastructure bill. Europe and Asia/Pacific are expected to continue to grow, and the recovery that started in Africa/Middle East and Latin America is expected to extend into 2018.

Resource Industries - The company believes that global economic momentum and increasing commodity prices are restoring miners’ business confidence and financial health. The company anticipates miners’ capital spend to increase as mining businesses invest in equipment replacement cycles. Higher machine utilization levels should support continued strong aftermarket parts opportunities. Strong global demand is expected to be a positive for heavy construction. 

Energy & Transportation - Sales into Oil and Gas applications are expected to increase in 2018, led by reciprocating engines for gas compression and well servicing in North America. The current turbines backlog is healthy in support of the midstream pipeline business. The company expects an increase in Transportation primarily from recent acquisitions in rail services, while the locomotive and marine markets are expected to remain challenged. Power Generation sales are forecast to be slightly up after a multi-year downturn. Sales into Industrial applications are expected to be about flat.

Following are key points to help understand the elements of the 2018 profit outlook:

•An expected increase in sales volume is the most significant reason for the higher profit outlook, with volume increases forecasted across the three primary segments. 

•Slightly favorable price realization is expected to be mostly offset by material cost increases due to higher commodity prices.

•Period costs excluding short-term incentive compensation expense are expected to increase due to labor inflation and targeted investments in profitable growth initiatives, including expanded offerings and services. 

•The outlook includes short-term incentive compensation expense of about $900 million.

•Financial Products’ segment profit is expected to be lower in 2018 than in 2017, primarily due to the absence of about $100 million of gains on sales of securities in 2017. 

•The outlook assumes a tax rate of 24 percent, including the company’s current estimate of the impact of U.S. tax reform legislation. 

•ME&T capital expenditures are expected to be about $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion.

•No stock repurchases are assumed in the outlook. 

•The outlook does not include a mark-to-market gain or loss for remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans or changes to provisional estimates recorded in 2017 for U.S. tax reform.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

Consolidated Sales and Revenues

The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Sales and Revenues between the fourth quarter of 2016 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2017 (at right). Items favorably impacting sales and revenues appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting sales and revenues appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s board of directors and employees.

Sales and Revenues

Total sales and revenues were $12.896 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $3.322 billion, or 35 percent, compared with $9.574 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, mostly due to improved end-user demand. In addition, favorable changes in dealer inventories contributed to increased sales volume. The improvement in end-user demand was across all regions and most end markets. The favorable change in dealer inventories was primarily due to a decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to dealer inventories that were about flat in the fourth quarter of 2017. By segment, the largest sales volume increase was in Construction Industries, mostly due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment and the favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories. Energy & Transportation’s sales volume increased due to higher demand across all applications. Sales volume for Resource Industries increased due to higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts. Favorable price realization, primarily in Construction Industries and Resource Industries, also contributed to the sales improvement. Financial Products’ revenues were about flat.

Sales increased across all regions with the largest increase in North America. Sales improved 46 percent in North America primarily due to higher end-user demand for both equipment and aftermarket parts. Changes in dealer inventories were favorable as dealer inventories decreased in the fourth quarter of 2016 and increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2017. EAME sales increased 38 percent primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and favorable price realization. Asia/Pacific sales increased 22 percent primarily due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment. About half of the sales improvement in Asia/Pacific was in China resulting from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. Sales increased 39 percent in Latin America due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that resulted in improved end-user demand from low levels, as well as favorable changes in dealer inventories.

Consolidated Operating Profit (Loss)

The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in Consolidated Operating Profit (Loss) between the fourth quarter of 2016 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2017 (at right). Items favorably impacting operating profit appear as upward stair steps with the corresponding dollar amounts above each bar, while items negatively impacting operating profit appear as downward stair steps with dollar amounts reflected in parentheses above each bar. Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s board of directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy & Transportation other operating (income) expenses.

Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.161 billion, compared with a loss of $1.262 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase of $2.423 billion was due to higher sales volume, a decrease in mark-to-market losses related to pension and OPEB plans and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge in Resource Industries in 2016. Favorable price realization, lower variable manufacturing costs and lower restructuring costs were mostly offset by higher period costs. Price realization was favorable, primarily in Construction Industries and Resource Industries.

Variable manufacturing costs were lower primarily due to the favorable impact from cost absorption and lower warranty expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory was about flat in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a reduction in inventory in the fourth quarter of 2016. Material costs were slightly unfavorable due to increases in steel prices. Period costs were higher primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Also contributing to increased period costs were targeted investments and higher manufacturing costs to support higher production volumes, partially offset by lower depreciation expense.

Restructuring costs were $245 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $395 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Other Profit/Loss Items 

▪Interest expense excluding Financial Products in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $169 million, an increase of $49 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to an early debt retirement. 

▪Other income/expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was income of $119 million, compared with income of $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The favorable change was primarily a result of gains on the sale of securities. 

▪The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter reflects an annual effective tax rate of approximately 28 percent, compared to approximately 36 percent for the full year of 2016, excluding the items discussed below. The effective tax

rate related to 2017 full-year adjusted profit before tax, excluding a discrete benefit from stock-based compensation awards, was 27 percent, compared to 26 percent in 2016.

The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 also includes a charge of $2.371 billion due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation on December 22, 2017. The provisionally estimated charge includes a $596 million write-down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018, with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. Three items partially offset this charge:

•A $130 million benefit related to the change from the third-quarter estimated annual tax rate of 32 percent to approximately 28 percent for the full year of 2017, primarily due to a more favorable geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective, including the impact of U.S. pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses taxed at higher U.S. rates. 

•A non-cash benefit of $111 million, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent, from reductions in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in the United States. 

•A tax benefit of $19 million for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. 

The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2016 also included a charge of $170 million related to the change from the third quarter of 2016 estimated annual tax rate. In addition, the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets was increased in 2016, resulting in a $141 million non-cash charge, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent.

Global Workforce

Caterpillar worldwide, full-time employment was about 98,400 at the end of 2017, an increase of about 3,000 full-time employees from the end of 2016, primarily the result of higher production volumes. The flexible workforce increased by about 7,300, also primarily due to higher production volumes. In total, the global workforce increased by about 10,300.

CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 1 Does not include inter-segment sales of $37 million and $31 million in fourth quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

Construction Industries’ sales were $5.258 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $3.589 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization.

▪Sales volume increased primarily due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment. In addition, there was a favorable impact from changes in dealer inventories as inventories decreased more in the fourth quarter of 2016 than in the fourth quarter of 2017. 

▪Price realization was favorable due to a weak pricing environment in the fourth quarter of 2016 and previously implemented price increases.

Sales increased across all regions with the largest increases in North America and Asia/Pacific. 

▪In North America, the sales increase was due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment, mostly due to oil and gas, residential and non-residential construction activities. The impact of favorable changes in dealer inventories, as inventories decreased in the fourth quarter of 2016 and were about flat in the fourth quarter of 2017, also contributed to increased sales. 

▪Sales in Asia/Pacific were higher as a result of an increase in end-user demand, primarily in China, stemming from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. 

▪Sales increased in EAME primarily due to higher end-user demand for construction equipment, reflecting improved economic conditions across much of the region. Favorable price realization also contributed to increased sales.

▪Although construction activity remained weak in Latin America, sales were higher as end-user demand increased from low levels due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region.

Construction Industries’ profit was $838 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $334 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in profit was primarily due to higher sales volume, favorable price realization and variable manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by unfavorable period costs and higher material costs, primarily for steel. The increase in period costs was due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense, targeted investments and higher manufacturing period costs to support increased production volumes.

RESOURCE INDUSTRIES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 1 Does not include inter-segment sales of $103 million and $87 million in fourth quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

Resource Industries’ sales were $2.205 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $762 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts in all regions, favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization. Dealer deliveries for new equipment increased significantly. Positive commodity price trends in 2017 drove improved market conditions and financial health of mining companies. After several years of low investment, miners began to increase capital expenditures, reflecting more confidence in their end markets. Dealer inventories increased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a slight decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Resource Industries’ profit was $209 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a loss of $711 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement was primarily due to the absence of a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Higher sales volume and favorable price realization also contributed to increased profit.

ENERGY & TRANSPORTATION

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 1 Does not include inter-segment sales of $934 million and $621 million in fourth quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively.  

Energy & Transportation’s sales were $4.706 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $3.849 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume across all applications.

▪Oil and Gas - Sales increased primarily due to higher demand for equipment used in gas compression and well servicing applications in North America. 

▪Transportation - Sales were higher in North America for rail services, driven by increased rail traffic, and due to additional deliveries of freight locomotives. 

▪Industrial - Sales were higher primarily in EAME due to increased demand for equipment used in electric power and agricultural end-user applications and aftermarket parts.

▪Power Generation - Sales increased in EAME primarily due to the timing of projects. 

Energy & Transportation’s profit was $881 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $638 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by higher period costs. The increase in period costs was primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense, costs associated with higher production and targeted investments.

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS SEGMENT

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Financial Products’ segment revenues were $783 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $41 million, or 6 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates in North America, higher average earning assets in EAME and Asia/Pacific and a favorable impact from intercompany lending activity in North America. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower average financing rates in Asia/Pacific.

Financial Products’ segment profit was $233 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $149 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher gains on sales of securities at Insurance Services and an increase in net yield on average earning assets.

At the end of 2017, past dues at Cat Financial were 2.78 percent, compared with 2.38 percent at the end of 2016. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $114 million for the full year of 2017, compared with $123 million for the full year of 2016.

As of December 31, 2017, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $365 million, or 1.33 percent of finance receivables, compared with $343 million, or 1.29 percent of finance receivables at year-end 2016.

Corporate Items and Eliminations

Expense for corporate items and eliminations was $898 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $683 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. Corporate items and eliminations include: restructuring costs; corporate-level expenses; timing differences, as some expenses are reported in segment profit on a cash basis; retirement benefit costs other than service cost; currency differences for ME&T, as segment profit is reported using annual fixed exchange rates; cost of sales methodology differences, as segments use a current cost methodology; and inter-segment eliminations.

The decrease in expense was primarily due to the favorable impact of lower mark-to-market losses related to pension and OPEB plans and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by methodology differences and higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Mark-to-market losses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $301 million, compared to mark-to-market losses of $985 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q1:Can you provide more information on the significant items impacting 2017 and 2016 profit?

A:In order for our results to be more meaningful to our readers, we have separately quantified the impact of several significant items. 

•Restructuring Costs - In recent years, we have incurred substantial restructuring costs to achieve a flexible and competitive cost structure. During 2017, we incurred $1.256 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium. During 2016, we incurred $1.019 billion of restructuring costs.

•Mark-to-Market Losses - Effective January 1, 2016, we made a change in accounting principle related to our pension and OPEB plans. Under this accounting principle, we recognize actuarial gains and losses as a mark-to-market gain or loss when incurred rather than amortizing them to earnings over time. For 2017, the mark-to-market adjustment was a net loss of $301 million, primarily due to lower interest rates and a change in mortality assumptions, partially offset by better than expected returns on plan assets. For 2016, the mark-to-market adjustment was a net loss of $985 million, primarily due to lower interest rates.

•State Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance - Based on improved profits in the United States, we reduced the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in a non-cash benefit of $111 million, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets was increased, resulting in a $141 million non-cash charge, net of U.S. federal tax at 35 percent.

•Goodwill Impairment Charge - During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $595 million related to Resource Industries. No goodwill impairment charges were recognized during 2017.

•U.S. Tax Reform - The fourth-quarter 2017 provision for income taxes includes a charge of $2.371 billion due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation on December 22, 2017. The provisionally estimated charge includes a $596 million write-down of net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, beginning January 1, 2018, with the remainder primarily related to the cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. Management believes this charge is a reasonable estimate, as of January 18, 2018, that may change as additional required information is prepared and analyzed, interpretations and assumptions are refined, additional guidance is issued, and due to actions we may take as a result of the legislation. 

To help improve the understanding of results for the quarter and the year, the following tables show the impact of these items:

Q2:Will new U.S. GAAP accounting rules effective in 2018 have an impact on your financial statements?

A: We will be adopting several new accounting rules in 2018, including the following:

•Revenue Recognition - We have completed our evaluation of the new accounting standard on revenue recognition and do not expect the impact will be material. We will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach, with no change to prior year financial statements.

•Equity Securities - Our investments in equity securities, primarily held by Insurance Services, will be measured at fair value through earnings. Previously, the fair value adjustments for these securities were reported in equity until the securities were sold or an impairment was recognized. We will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach, with no change to prior year financial statements. At December 31, 2017, the fair value of our equity securities impacted by this accounting change was approximately $450 million.

•Pension and OPEB Costs - Components of pension and OPEB costs, other than service costs, will be reclassified from operating costs to other income/expense. This change will be made retroactively to all periods presented. In 2017, these costs included a net credit of approximately $275 million related to ongoing costs and a charge of $301 million for the year-end mark-to-market adjustment. 

Q3:Can you discuss changes in dealer inventories during 2017?

A:Changes in dealer inventories had a positive impact on sales from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017. Dealer machine and engine inventories were about flat in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a decrease of about $800 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year of 2017, dealer inventories increased about $100 million, compared with a decrease of about $1.6 billion for the full year of 2016. 

Q4:Can you discuss changes to your order backlog by segment?

A:At the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, the order backlog was about $15.8 billion, an increase of about $400 million from the end of the third quarter of 2017. The increase was in Resource Industries, partially offset by a decline in Energy & Transportation. Construction Industries’ order backlog was about flat.

Compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, the order backlog increased about $3.7 billion. The increase was across all segments, most significantly in Resource Industries and Construction Industries.

Q5:Can you comment on expense related to your 2017 short-term incentive compensation plans?

A:Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. Fourth-quarter 2017 expense was about $350 million, compared to fourth-quarter

16

2016 expense of about $50 million. Full-year 2017 expense was about $1.4 billion, compared to full-year 2016 expense of about $250 million.

Q6:Full-year 2017 sales and revenues were up 18 percent, and the fourth quarter of 2017 was up 35 percent. Is this significant ramp in demand impacting availability and how is the company responding?

A:The sharp increase in demand in 2017, which followed four years of declining sales, led to ramp-up challenges for certain products due to supplier constraints. During 2017, the company worked with our global suppliers to respond to significant increases in demand. Despite improvements in material flows in the second half of 2017, parts and components constraints remain across some products, which could impact the company’s growth potential in 2018 as we continue to ramp up our global suppliers.

Q7:Can you comment on your balance sheet and cash priorities?

A:The ME&T debt-to-capital ratio was 36.7 percent at the end of 2017, compared with 41.0 percent at the end of 2016. The improvement was primarily due to lower debt of $1.2 billion, which included the early debt retirement of about $900 million due in December 2018.

Our cash and liquidity positions remain strong with an enterprise cash balance of $8.3 billion as of year-end 2017. ME&T operating cash flow for the full year of 2017 was $5.5 billion, compared with $3.9 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher profit offset partially by working capital impacts including increases in inventory during 2017. During the year, ME&T capital expenditures totaled $916 million. Funding for defined benefit pension plans was about $1.4 billion, including a $1.0 billion discretionary U.S. contribution completed in December 2017.

Our priorities for cash deployment have not changed. While our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate, our long-term cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities. Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a Mid-A rating. Next, we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments. Then, we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The following definitions are provided for the non-GAAP financial measures used in this report. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures.

Adjusted Profit

Caterpillar believes it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of several significant items in order for the company’s results to be meaningful to readers. These items consist of (i) restructuring costs, which are incurred in the current year to generate longer-term benefits, (ii) pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses resulting from plan remeasurements, (iii) state deferred tax valuation allowance (reversal), (iv) a gain on the sale of an equity investment, (v) U.S. tax reform impact and (vi) goodwill impairment charges. Caterpillar does not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believes the non-GAAP measures will provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends, and a means to assess period-over-period results. 

Reconciliations of adjusted profit before taxes to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, consolidated profit (loss) before taxes, are as follows:

Reconciliations of adjusted profit per share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, diluted profit per share, are as follows:
