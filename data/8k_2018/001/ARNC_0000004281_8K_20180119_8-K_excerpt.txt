 Item 1.01.Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

On January 19, 2018, the Board of Directors of Arconic Inc. (the “Company”) approved a new form of indemnification agreement (the “Indemnification Agreement”) between the Company and individuals who may serve from time to time as directors or officers of the Company. The Indemnification Agreement supplements indemnification provisions contained in the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and supersedes previously existing indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors and officers. Under the Indemnification Agreement, the Company agrees to indemnify directors and officers against liability arising out of the performance of their duties to the Company and to other entities where they provide services at the request of the Company. The Indemnification Agreement requires indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by law for expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement incurred by directors and officers in connection with a range of legal proceedings, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Indemnification Agreement. The Indemnification Agreement also requires the advancement of expenses in connection with proceedings and includes customary procedures with respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses, in each case on the terms and conditions set forth therein. 

The foregoing description of the Indemnification Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Indemnification Agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
