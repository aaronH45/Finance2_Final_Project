Ms. Addison, Ms. Alston and Ms. Thigpen will each serve for an initial term commencing on her February 26, 2018 election and ending at the beginning of the April 26, 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. There were no understandings or arrangements pursuant to which any of Ms. Addison, Ms. Alston and Ms. Thigpen were selected as directors. 

Having been determined by the Board to be "independent" pursuant to NYSE rules and additional Company criteria, Ms. Addison was named to serve on the Compensation Committee of the Board and Ms. Alston and Ms. Thigpen, respectively, were named to serve on the Audit Committee of the Board, effective as of such committees’ April 2018 meetings.
