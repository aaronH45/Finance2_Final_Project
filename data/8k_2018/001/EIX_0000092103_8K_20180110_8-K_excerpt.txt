Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure

On January 10, 2018, Southern California Edison Company, San Diego Gas & Electric Co., the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility, the California Large Energy Consumers Association, California State University, Citizens Oversight, the Coalition of California Utility Employees, the Direct Access Customer Coalition, Ruth Henricks, The Office of Ratepayer Advocates, The Utility Reform Network, and Women’s Energy Matters (together, the “Parties”) sent an email to the Administrative Law Judge presiding over the San Onofre Order Instituting Investigation advising that they have continued their mediated settlement discussions and anticipate serving a notice of settlement conference within 15 days. Under rules of the CPUC, prior to signing any settlement, the settling parties must provide at least seven days advance notice and convene at least one conference for the purpose of providing all parties with the opportunity to discuss settlements in the proceeding. Any such settlement conference is confidential and limited to the parties in the proceeding and their representatives. 

None of the Parties is required to sign any settlement agreement and may not do so prior to the settlement conference. If a settlement agreement is signed following the conference, then it may be disclosed. However, under the CPUC’s rules it will remain subject to CPUC approval and may not be effectuated without such approval. Such approval is subject to the discretion of the CPUC. Under CPUC rules, if a motion for settlement is filed, then the settlement will be subject to a period for comments from other parties to the proceeding. Were material factual issues to be contested, or if the CPUC otherwise chose to do so, there would be an evidentiary hearing on the merits of any settlement proposal prior to a final CPUC decision, and final decisions of the CPUC may be subject to appeal. There is no assurance that a settlement agreement will be signed, or if it is signed that it will be approved by the CPUC. Furthermore, even if a settlement agreement is signed, Southern California Edison Company cannot predict when the CPUC will reach a decision about its approval or disapproval. Under the CPUC’s rules, the terms discussed by the Parties are confidential and may not be disclosed outside the negotiations without the consent of all Parties participating in the negotiations. Consequently, except for discussions at the confidential settlement conference, the settlement terms discussed by the Parties will be maintained as confidential unless the Parties mutually agree to publicly release the terms or unless and until a formal settlement agreement has been signed, as to which no assurance can be given. 

The email to the Administrative Law Judge is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
