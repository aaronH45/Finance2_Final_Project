NEW YORK, January 18, 2018 – The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (“BNY Mellon”) (NYSE: BK) today reported fourth quarter net income applicable to common shareholders of $1.13 billion, or $1.08 per diluted common share. Results for the fourth quarter 2017 include an estimated net benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. tax legislation”) of $427 million, or $0.41 per common share, and severance, litigation and other charges of $246 million, or $0.24 per common share (a). Net income applicable to common shareholders was $822 million, or $0.77 per diluted common share, in the fourth quarter of 2016, and $983 million, or $0.94 per diluted common share, in the third quarter of 2017. 

“Our fourth quarter results were impacted by new tax legislation and actions that we took to strengthen our firm for the longer term. Aside from these items, our results were favorably impacted by strong equity markets and the underlying businesses continued to show modest growth in revenues and profits,” Charles W. Scharf, chairman and chief executive officer, said.

“We saw strength in asset servicing along with growth in collateral management and clearing services – areas where we see continued client demand. Additionally, our investment management business performed well due to an uplift from global equity markets, net inflows and improved investment performance fees, resulting from good investment performance, especially in fixed income,” Mr. Scharf continued.

“The actions that resulted in the severance and other charges during the quarter are part of an ongoing review of our performance. We expect this review to be completed by our March 8th Investor Day where we intend to provide a comprehensive update of the review and have a broader discussion about our firm.”

“In addition, we have thought how best to use the ongoing benefit from lower taxes and we believe that we have a responsibility to our employees to share the benefit, as well as to invest as much as we intelligently can to build the company for the future so we can serve our clients, communities, and shareholders for the long term. At this point, we are anticipating that the impact of the lower tax rate would be almost entirely offset by actions that we will take to reinvest this benefit in our employees and our business,” Mr. Scharf concluded.

(a)Other charges include an asset impairment and investment securities losses related to the sale of certain securities.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Foreign exchange revenue was unchanged compared with 4Q16 and increased 11% sequentially. Year-over-year, higher volumes were offset by lower volatility. The sequential increase reflects higher volumes. The sequential decrease in other trading revenue primarily reflects the impact of hedging activities.

•Financing-related fees increased 8% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher underwriting fees. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Both decreases in investment and other income primarily reflect lower other income driven by the impact of U.S. tax legislation on our investments in renewable energy. The net impact of U.S. tax legislation on renewable energy investments was de minimis to net income, as the pre-tax accounting resulted in a reduction of $279 million to investment and other income, which was offset by the tax benefit from remeasurement of the related deferred tax liability.

•Net securities losses were $26 million in 4Q17, driven by losses of $37 million on the sale of certain investment securities.

KEY POINTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Both the year-over-year and sequential increases primarily reflect higher staff, litigation, software and equipment and professional, legal and other purchased services expenses. The year-over-year increase also reflects the unfavorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar.

•Staff expense reflects higher severance expense. Year-over-year, staff expense also reflects higher incentives, driven by stronger performance.

•Software and equipment and professional, legal and other purchased services expenses primarily reflect an asset impairment recorded in 4Q17.

•The sequential increase also reflects seasonally higher business development expense and higher net occupancy expense, driven by the cost to exit leased space.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO

At Dec. 31, 2017, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio totaled $119.9 billion. The net unrealized pre-tax loss on our total securities portfolio was $85 million at Dec. 31, 2017 compared with a pre-tax gain of $257 million at Sept. 30, 2017. The net unrealized pre-tax loss was primarily driven by an increase in long-term interest rates. At Dec. 31, 2017, the fair value of the held-to-maturity securities totaled $40.5 billion and represented 34% of the fair value of the total investment securities portfolio.

The following table shows the distribution of our investment securities portfolio.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Nonperforming assets decreased $4 million compared with Sept. 30, 2017 and $17 million compared with Dec. 31, 2016. The decrease in nonperforming assets compared with Sept. 30, 2017 primarily reflects lower other residential mortgages and financial institutions.

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY

Our consolidated capital ratios are shown in the following table. The common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”), Tier 1 and Total risk-based regulatory capital ratios in the first section of the table below are based on Basel III components of capital, as phased-in (referred to as “Transitional ratios”).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Regulatory capital ratios for Dec. 31, 2017 are preliminary. For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under the U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches.

(b)The leverage capital ratio is based on Tier 1 capital, as phased-in and quarterly average total assets. 

(c)Estimated.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Primarily related to stock awards, the exercise of stock options and stock issued for employee benefit plans.

(b) Reflects transitional adjustments to CET1 required under the U.S. capital rules.

(c) Estimated.

BNY Mellon 4Q17 Earnings Release

The table presented below compares the fully phased-in Basel III capital components and risk-based ratios to those capital components and ratios determined on a transitional basis.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Preliminary.

(b) Reflects transitional adjustments to CET1, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital required under the U.S. capital rules. 

(c) Estimated.

BNY Mellon has presented its estimated fully phased-in CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios and the fully phased-in SLR based on its interpretation of the U.S. capital rules, which are being gradually phased-in over a multi-year period, and on the application of such rules to BNY Mellon’s businesses as currently conducted. Management views the estimated fully phased-in CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios and fully phased-in SLR as key measures in monitoring BNY Mellon’s capital position and progress against future regulatory capital standards. Additionally, the presentation of the estimated fully phased-in CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios and fully phased-in SLR are intended to allow investors to compare these ratios with estimates presented by other companies. 

Page - 13

BNY Mellon 4Q17 Earnings Release

Our capital and liquidity ratios are necessarily subject to, among other things, BNY Mellon’s further review of applicable rules, anticipated compliance with all necessary enhancements to model calibration, approval by regulators of certain models used as part of RWA calculations, other refinements, further implementation guidance from regulators, market practices and standards and any changes BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. Consequently, our capital and liquidity ratios remain subject to ongoing review and revision and may change based on these factors.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio

The following table presents the SLR on both the transitional and fully phased-in Basel III basis for BNY Mellon and our largest bank subsidiary, The Bank of New York Mellon.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Preliminary.

(b)Estimated.

(c)The estimated fully phased-in SLR (Non-GAAP) is based on our interpretation of the U.S. capital rules. When the SLR is fully phased-in in 2018 as a required minimum ratio, we expect to maintain an SLR of over 5%. The minimum required SLR is 3% and there is a 2% buffer, in addition to the minimum, that is applicable to U.S. G-SIBs. The insured depository institution subsidiaries of the U.S. G-SIBs, including those of BNY Mellon, must maintain a 6% SLR to be considered “well capitalized.” 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”)

The U.S. LCR rules became fully phased-in on Jan. 1, 2017 and require BNY Mellon to meet an LCR of 100%. On a consolidated basis, our average LCR was 118% for 4Q17. High-quality liquid assets (“HQLA”), before haircuts and trapped liquidity, totaled $193 billion at Dec. 31, 2017 and averaged $170 billion for 4Q17.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION – IMPACT OF U.S. TAX LEGISLATION AND OTHER CHARGES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Other charges include severance, litigation, an asset impairment and investment securities losses related to the sale of certain securities.

Our estimate of the impact of U.S. tax legislation is based on certain assumptions and our current interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and may change, possibly materially, as we refine our analysis and as further information becomes available. 

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION – EXPLANATION OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

BNY Mellon has included in this Earnings Release certain Non-GAAP financial measures based on estimated fully phased-in CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios, the estimated fully phased-in SLR and tangible common shareholders’ equity. BNY Mellon believes that the CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios, on a fully phased-in basis, and the SLR, on a fully phased-in basis, are measures of capital strength that provide additional useful information to investors, supplementing the capital ratios which are, or were, required by regulatory authorities. The tangible common shareholders’ equity ratio, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, includes changes in investment securities valuations which are reflected in total shareholders’ equity. In addition, this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual book value of assets. BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure is an additional useful measure for investors because it presents a measure of those assets that can generate income. BNY Mellon has provided a measure of tangible book value per common share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of tangible assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding.

BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures, which exclude the effect of noncontrolling interests related to consolidated investment management funds, and expense measures, which exclude amortization of intangible assets and M&I, litigation and restructuring charges. 

Operating margin, operating leverage and return on equity measures, which exclude some or all of these items, are also presented. Operating margin measures may also exclude the provision for credit losses and distribution and servicing expense. BNY Mellon believes that these measures are useful to investors because they permit a focus on period-to-period comparisons, which relate to the ability of BNY Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where such matters are within BNY Mellon’s control. M&I expenses primarily relate to acquisitions and generally continue for approximately three years after the transaction. Litigation charges represent accruals for loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable, but exclude standard business-related legal fees. Restructuring charges relate to our streamlining actions and Operational Excellence Initiatives. Excluding the charges mentioned above permits investors to view expenses on a basis consistent with how management views the business. 

Page - 23

BNY Mellon 4Q17 Earnings Release

The presentation of revenue growth on a constant currency basis permits investors to assess the significance of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Growth rates on a constant currency basis were determined by applying the current period foreign currency exchange rates to the prior period revenue. BNY Mellon believes that this presentation, as a supplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearer picture of the related revenue results without the variability caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

The presentation of income from consolidated investment management funds, net of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related to the consolidation of certain investment management funds, permits investors to view revenue on a basis consistent with how management views the business. BNY Mellon believes that these presentations, as a supplement to GAAP information, give investors a clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses.

Each of these measures as described above is used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a company-wide and on a business-level basis. 

The following table presents the reconciliation of the pre-tax operating margin ratio. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Non-GAAP information for all periods presented excludes net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated investment management funds, amortization of intangible assets and M&I, litigation and restructuring charges.
