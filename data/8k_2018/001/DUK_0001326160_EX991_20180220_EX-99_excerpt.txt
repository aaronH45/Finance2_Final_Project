Duke Energy reports fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

▪Company achieves financial results near the high end of narrowed 2017 adjusted diluted guidance range

▪2018 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range set at $4.55 to $4.85, including estimated impacts of the Tax Act

▪Company reaffirms and extends to 2022 long-term earnings growth expectation of 4 to 6 percent off original 2017 midpoint of $4.60 

CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) today announced 2017 full-year reported diluted EPS, prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $4.36, compared to $3.11 for full-year 2016. Duke Energy's full-year 2017 adjusted diluted EPS was $4.57, compared to $4.69 for full-year 2016. 

Adjusted diluted EPS excludes the impact of certain items that are included in GAAP reported diluted EPS. The difference between 2017 GAAP reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS was largely due to costs to achieve the Piedmont merger, charges related to regulatory settlements and Commercial Renewables impairments; partially offset by the estimated impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) enacted in December 2017. 

Full-year 2017 adjusted results were driven by unfavorable weather and the absence of International Energy, which was sold in December 2016. Partially offsetting these drivers were growth in the electric and gas businesses, including the addition of a full year's earnings contribution from Piedmont Natural Gas, and ongoing cost management efforts.

“This was an exceptional year for Duke Energy as we executed on our strategy and delivered on our commitments in 2017,” said Lynn Good, Duke Energy chairman, president and CEO. “By focusing on cost management and operational excellence, we achieved strong financial results, ending the year near the high end of our narrowed guidance range.

“Looking forward, we have the right long-term strategy in place, supported by a solid capital growth plan. Our vision is clear – we are investing in infrastructure our customers value and delivering sustainable growth for our investors.”

Duke Energy News Release 2

Duke Energy's fourth quarter 2017 GAAP reported EPS was $1.00, compared to a loss per share of $0.33 for fourth quarter 2016. The loss per share in 2016 was primarily driven by a loss on the sale of International Energy. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted diluted EPS was $0.94 compared to $0.81 for fourth quarter 2016. Higher adjusted results were driven by disciplined cost management efforts, including higher planned spending in fourth quarter 2016, and favorable weather; partially offset by the absence of International Energy.

The company has set its 2018 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.55 to $4.85, and reaffirmed and extended its long-term adjusted diluted EPS growth rate of 4 to 6 percent through 2022. The growth rate continues to be anchored to the midpoint of the original 2017 adjusted diluted guidance range, or $4.60 per share, and is supported by the company's robust growth capital plan.

Business segment results

In addition to the following summary of fourth quarter 2017 business segment performance, comprehensive tables with detailed EPS drivers for the quarter and full year 2017, compared to prior year, are provided in the tables at the end of this news release.

The discussion below of fourth quarter results includes both GAAP segment income and adjusted segment income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The tables at the end of this news release present a full reconciliation of GAAP reported results to adjusted results. 

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure

On a reported basis, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter 2017 segment income of $826 million, compared to $483 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition to the drivers outlined below, fourth quarter 2017 results were impacted by a $231 million benefit related to the Tax Act and a $14 million after-tax charge related to regulatory settlements. These amounts were treated as special items and excluded from adjusted earnings.

On an adjusted basis, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter 2017 adjusted segment income of $609 million, compared to $483 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $0.18 per share. 

Higher quarterly results at Electric Utilities and Infrastructure were primarily due to favorable weather (+$0.08 per share) and lower operation and maintenance expense (+$0.11 per share), driven by ongoing cost management and higher planned spending in 2016. 

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure

On a reported basis, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter segment income of $140 million, compared to $89 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition to the drivers outlined below, fourth quarter 2017 results were impacted by a $26 million benefit related to the Tax Act, which was treated as a special item and excluded from adjusted earnings.

Duke Energy News Release 3

On an adjusted basis, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter adjusted segment income of $114 million, compared to $89 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $0.04 per share.

Higher quarterly results at Gas Utilities and Infrastructure were driven by customer growth and increased integrity management investments at Piedmont (+$0.02 per share), as well as higher earnings from increased investment in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline (+$0.01 per share).

Commercial Renewables

On a reported basis, Commercial Renewables recognized fourth quarter 2017 segment income of $439 million, compared to $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition to the drivers outlined below, fourth quarter 2017 results were impacted by a $442 million benefit related to the Tax Act and an $18 million after-tax impairment charge related to certain renewables investments. These amounts were treated as special items and excluded from adjusted earnings. 

On an adjusted basis, Commercial Renewables recognized fourth quarter 2017 segment income of $15 million, compared to $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $0.01 per share. Higher quarterly results at Commercial Renewables were primarily due to a new wind project brought on-line in late 2016 and improved wind resources.

Other

Other primarily includes interest expense on holding company debt and other unallocated corporate costs. It also includes results from Duke Energy’s captive insurance company and the equity method investment in NMC.

On a reported basis, Other recognized fourth quarter 2017 net expense of $700 million, compared to net expense of $209 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition to the drivers outlined below, fourth quarter 2017 results were impacted by a $597 million charge related to the Tax Act and lower after-tax costs to achieve the Piedmont merger. These charges were treated as special items and excluded from adjusted earnings.

On an adjusted basis, Other recognized fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net expense of $82 million, compared to adjusted net expense of $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a difference of $0.04 per share. Lower quarterly results at Other were primarily due to higher income tax expense (-$0.05 per share).

Duke Energy's consolidated reported effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 18.6%, compared to 26.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to the estimated impacts of the Tax Act in 2017. The consolidated adjusted effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2017 was 31.5%, compared to 30.4% in 2016. Adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure. The tables at the end of this news release present a reconciliation of the GAAP reported effective tax rate to the adjusted effective tax rate.

Discontinued Operations

For the fourth quarter of 2016, Duke Energy's GAAP reported Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax included a loss on the sale of the International Disposal Group and other 

Duke Energy News Release 4

transaction-related costs, partially offset by the operating results of the International Disposal Group prior to the sale of $40 million. The operating results of $40 million, or $0.06 per share, were included in Duke Energy's adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2016.

Special Items and Non-GAAP Reconciliation

The following tables present a reconciliation of GAAP reported to adjusted diluted EPS for fourth quarter and full-year 2017 and 2016 financial results:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)The Tax Act reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. As the tax change was enacted in 2017, Duke Energy is required to remeasure its deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower rate. For Duke Energy's regulated operations, where the reduction is expected to be returned to customers in future rates, the remeasurement has been deferred as a regulatory liability.

(b)Includes a loss on sale of the International Disposal Group. Represents the GAAP reported Loss from Discontinued Operations, less the International Disposal Group operating results, which are included in adjusted earnings.

Non-GAAP financial measures

Management evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS.

Adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS represent income from continuing operations attributable to Duke Energy, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items. As discussed below, special items include certain charges and credits which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy's ongoing performance. Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy’s performance across periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Duke Energy Board of Directors, employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. Adjusted diluted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are Net Income Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation (GAAP Reported Earnings) and Diluted EPS Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP Reported EPS), respectively. 

Special items included in the periods presented include the following items which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:

•Costs to achieve mergers represent charges that result from strategic acquisitions.

•Cost savings initiatives represent severance charges related to company-wide initiatives, excluding merger integration, to standardize processes and systems, leverage technology and workforce optimization.

Duke Energy News Release 6

•Regulatory settlements represent charges related to the Levy nuclear project in Florida and the Mayo Zero Liquid Discharge and Sutton combustion turbine projects in North Carolina.

•Commercial Renewables impairments represent other-than-temporary, asset and goodwill impairments.

•Impacts of the Tax Act represent estimated amounts recognized related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Adjusted earnings also include operating results of the International Disposal Group, which has been classified as discontinued operations. Management believes inclusion of the operating results of the International Disposal Group within adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS results in a better reflection of Duke Energy's financial performance during the period.

Due to the forward-looking nature of any forecasted adjusted earnings guidance, information to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as management is unable to project all special items for future periods (such as legal settlements, the impact of regulatory orders or asset impairments).

Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income and other net expense. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations attributable to Duke Energy. Segment income includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management also uses adjusted segment income as a measure of historical and anticipated future segment performance. Adjusted segment income is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it is based upon segment income adjusted for special items, which are discussed above. Management believes the presentation of adjusted segment income provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of a segment’s performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted segment income or adjusted other net expense is segment income and other net expense.

Due to the forward-looking nature of any forecasted adjusted segment income or adjusted other net expense and any related growth rates for future periods, information to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not available at this time, as the company is unable to forecast all special items, as discussed above. 

Duke Energy’s adjusted earnings, adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted segment income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner.
