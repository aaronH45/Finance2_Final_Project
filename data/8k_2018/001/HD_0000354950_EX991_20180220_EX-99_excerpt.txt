ATLANTA, February 20, 2018 -- The Home Depot®, the world's largest home improvement retailer, today reported sales of $23.9 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a 7.5 percent increase from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 were positive 7.5 percent, and comp sales for U.S. stores were positive 7.2 percent. 

Net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 were $1.8 billion, or $1.52 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $1.7 billion, or $1.44 per diluted share, in the same period of fiscal 2016. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, diluted earnings per share increased 5.6 percent from the same period in the prior year.

On January 25, 2018, the Company announced that it expected the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to result in an additional net tax expense of approximately $150 million. The provisional amount recorded in the fourth quarter was $127 million. This charge, coupled with the one-time bonus payment to hourly associates that was also announced on January 25, 2018, negatively impacted fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.17.
