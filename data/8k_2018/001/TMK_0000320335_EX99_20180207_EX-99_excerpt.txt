Fourth Quarter 2017 Results 

McKinney, TX, February 7, 2018—Torchmark Corporation (NYSE: TMK) reported today that for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net income was $8.71 per diluted common share(1), compared with $1.12 per diluted common share for the year-ago quarter. Net operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.24 per diluted common share, compared with $1.15 per diluted common share for the year-ago quarter. 

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $12.22 per diluted common share(1), compared with $4.49 per diluted common share for the year-ago period. Net operating income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4.82 per diluted common share compared with $4.49 per diluted common share for the prior year. 

HIGHLIGHTS: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 • Life underwriting margins increased over the year-ago quarter by 12%.

 • Life premiums increased over the year-ago quarter by 9% at American Income and health premiums increased by 8% at Family Heritage.

 • Net life sales increased over the year-ago quarter by 19% at Liberty National and 7% at American Income.

 • Net health sales increased over the year-ago quarter by 14%.

 • Average agent counts increased over the year-ago quarter by 19% at Liberty National and 8% at Family Heritage.

 • Approximately 950,000 shares of common stock were repurchased during the quarter and 4.1 million shares were repurchased during the year.

(1) On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation) was signed into law which significantly revises corporate income tax rates from 35% to 21%, among other modifications. As a result, the Company made a one-time adjustment to estimate the impact related to the Tax Legislation. The estimated impact is treated as a non-operating event and thus excluded from net operating income from continuing operations.

Net income per share for the quarter and net income per share for the year calculated prior to the tax reform adjustment would have been $1.30 and $4.88, respectively. Excluding the tax reform adjustment, net income for the year as a ROE and net operating income for the year as a ROE, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, would have been 11.7% and 14.4%, respectively.

FINANCIAL SUMMARY 

Quarter End 

(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)

(unaudited)

Net operating income, a non-GAAP(1) financial measure, has been used consistently by Torchmark’s management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the Company, and is a measure commonly used in the life insurance industry. It differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized investment gains and losses and certain significant and unusual items included in net income. Management believes an analysis of net operating income is important in understanding the profitability and operating trends of the Company’s business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) GAAP is defined as generally accepted accounting principles.

(2) Definitions included within this document.

(3) Under GAAP, benefit costs can exceed premiums in the first part of the year, but be less than premiums during the remainder of the year. For net operating income purposes, Torchmark deferred excess benefits incurred in the first three quarters in 2016 to the fourth quarter in 2016 in order to more closely match the benefit cost with the associated revenue. These reconciling items also include post-sale adjustments.

(4) Due to the passage of the Tax Legislation, the Company recorded $874 million in net income, primarily related to a one-time adjustment to reduce its net deferred tax liability, as required by ASC 740, due to the reduction in the statutory income tax rate. The tax reform adjustment is treated as a non-operating event and thus excluded from net operating income from continuing operations.

Based on our analysis of the Tax Legislation, the Company was able to determine a reasonable estimate for the tax reform adjustment as noted above. However, we will continue to analyze relevant information to complete our accounting for income taxes which may result in an adjustment to our estimate in 2018. The accounting is expected to be complete when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return is filed in 2018.

(5) A GAAP-basis consolidated statement of operations is included in the appendix of this report.

FINANCIAL SUMMARY, CONT

Management vs. GAAP measures

(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)

(unaudited)

Shareholders' equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, and book value per share, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, are non-GAAP measures that are utilized by management to view the business without the effect of unrealized gains or losses which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates on the available-for-sale portfolio. Management views the business in this manner because the Company has the ability and generally, the intent, to hold investments to maturity and meaningful trends can more easily be identified without the fluctuations. Shareholders' equity and book value per share are the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Calculated using average shareholders' equity for the measurement period.

(2) Net income as a ROE for the year-to-date quarter and net operating income as a ROE, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, calculated prior to the tax reform adjustment would have been 11.7% and 14.4%, respectively. Excluding the tax reform adjustment, shareholders' equity and shareholders' equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, would have been $5.36 billion and $4.08 billion, respectively, and book value per share and book value per share, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, would have been $45.52 and $34.68, respectively.

Note: Net unrealized gains on fixed maturities referred to above are net of tax.

INSURANCE UNDERWRITING INCOME

(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)

(unaudited)

Insurance underwriting margin is management’s measure of profitability of its life, health, and annuity segments’ underwriting performance, and consists of premiums less policy obligations, commissions and other acquisition expenses. Insurance underwriting income is the sum of the insurance underwriting margins of the life, health, and annuity segments, plus other income, less insurance administrative expenses. It excludes the investment segment, parent company expense and income taxes. Management believes this information helps provide a better understanding of the business and a more meaningful analysis of underwriting results by distribution channel. Insurance underwriting income, a non-GAAP measure, is a component of net operating income, which is reconciled to net income in the Financial Summary section above.

INVESTMENTS 

EXCESS INVESTMENT INCOME

(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)

(unaudited)

Management uses excess investment income as the measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest on debt. We also view excess investment income per diluted common share as an important and useful measure to evaluate performance of the investment segment as it takes into consideration our stock repurchase program.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Interest on net policy liabilities is a component of total policyholder benefits (a GAAP measure).

Net investment income increased 4%, while average invested assets increased 6%. The 5% increase in required interest on net policy liabilities was in line with a similar increase in average net policy liabilities. The weighted average discount rate for the net policy liabilities was 5.6% and in line with the year-ago quarter.

Investment Portfolio 

The composition of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 is as follows:

SHARE REPURCHASE:

During the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 950,000 shares of Torchmark Corporation common stock at a total cost of $82 million for an average share price of $86.06. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 4.1 million shares at a total cost of $325 million for an average share price of $78.67. 

LIQUIDITY/CAPITAL: 

Torchmark's operations consist primarily of writing basic protection life and supplemental health insurance policies which generate strong and stable cash flows. In the long-term, the lower corporate income tax rates included in the Tax Legislation adopted on December 22, 2017 should increase the after-tax cash flows received from the Company's operations. However, in the short and intermediate term, the benefits of the lower tax rate will be virtually offset by several provisions included in the Tax Legislation that broaden the tax base. In addition, the amount of deferred tax assets recorded at the insurance companies on a regulatory-basis will be reduced as of the end of 2017 as a result of changes made by the Tax Legislation, resulting in lower statutory capital. Despite this reduction, capital at the insurance companies is sufficient to support operations. 

EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018: 

Torchmark projects that net operating income from continuing operations per share will be in the range of $5.90 to $6.10 for the year ending December 31, 2018. The $6.00 mid-point of this guidance is higher than the mid-point of our previous guidance due to the effect of the lower statutory tax rates included in the Tax Legislation.

In this news release, Torchmark includes non-GAAP measures to enhance investors' understanding of management's view of the business.
