Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

On January 19, 2018, Hologic, Inc. (“Hologic” or the “Company”) completed a private placement of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, allocated between (i) $600 million of its 4.375% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) at an offering price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from October 10, 2017, and (ii) $400 million of its new 4.625% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes,” and together with the 2025 Notes, the “Notes”) at an offering price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes. The Notes were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any state securities laws, and were offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain domestic subsidiaries of Hologic (the “Guarantors”).  

The 2025 Notes were issued as additional notes pursuant to a supplement (the “Supplemental Indenture”) to the indenture (as amended and supplemented, the “2025 Indenture”), dated as of October 10, 2017, among the Company, the Guarantors and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, which indenture governs the Company’s 4.375% senior notes due 2025. The 2025 Notes mature on October 15, 2025 and bear interest at the rate of 4.375% per year, payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2018.  

The 2028 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the “2028 Indenture,” and together with the 2025 Indenture, the “Indentures”), dated as of January 19, 2018, among the Company, the Guarantors and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The 2028 Notes mature on February 1, 2028 and bear interest at the rate of 4.625% per year, payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on August 1, 2018.  

The Indentures contain covenants which limit, among other things, the ability of the Company and its Guarantors to create liens and engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.  

At any time prior to October 15, 2020, with respect to the 2025 Notes, and at any time prior to February 1, 2023, with respect to the 2028 Notes, the Company may redeem such Notes at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date and a make-whole premium set forth in the applicable Indenture. The Company may also redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at any time and from time to time before October 15, 2020, at a redemption price equal to 104.375% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The Company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at any time and from time to time before February 1, 2021, at a redemption price equal to 104.625% of the aggregate principal amount so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. On or after October 15, 2020, with respect to the 2025 Notes, or February 1, 2023, with respect to the 2028 Notes, the Company may redeem the applicable Notes at redemption prices set forth in each Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. In addition, if the Company undergoes a change of control coupled with a decline in ratings, as provided in the applicable Indenture, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase each of the applicable holder’s Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.  

The Indentures also contain certain customary events of default, including among others, failure to pay interest on the applicable Notes that continues for a period of 30 days after payment is due, failure to pay the principal of, or premium, if any, on the applicable Notes when due upon maturity, redemption, required repurchase, acceleration or otherwise, failure to comply with certain covenants and agreements, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. An event of default under either Indenture will allow the applicable trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes issued under such Indenture to declare to be immediately due and payable the principal amount of all such Notes then outstanding, plus accrued but unpaid interest to the date of acceleration, or in the case of events of default involving bankruptcy or insolvency, such principal amount plus interest of all the applicable Notes shall become automatically due and payable immediately without any further action or notice.  

As previously disclosed, Hologic intends to use the net proceeds of the Notes, plus available cash, which may include funds from its secured revolving credit facility, to redeem its outstanding 5.250% senior notes due 2022 in the aggregate original principal amount of $1.0 billion, on or about February 15, 2018.
