GLENVIEW, Ill., January 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE: ITW) today reported its fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results.

“We also continued to make meaningful progress on our focused efforts to accelerate organic growth. Our 2017 organic growth rate of 3% was up almost 2 percentage points versus 2016. In addition, our Q4 organic growth rate of 4% gives us good momentum going into 2018.”

“Overall, these results demonstrate continued progress in our efforts to position ITW to generate consistent differentiated performance on a sustained basis,” Santi added. “Through the combination of ITW’s high quality business portfolio and our ongoing focus on leveraging ITW’s powerful business model to full potential, we are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2018 and beyond.”

Fourth-quarter revenue grew 7% to $3.6 billion as organic revenue increased 4% and foreign currency translation increased revenue by 3%. GAAP EPS of $(0.22) includes a one-time $658 million charge associated with the passage of the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.” The charge encompasses several elements, including a repatriation tax on accumulated overseas earnings and a benefit from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
