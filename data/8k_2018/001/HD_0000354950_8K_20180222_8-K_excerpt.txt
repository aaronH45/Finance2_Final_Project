On February 22, 2018, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee (the "LDCC") of the Board of the Directors (the "Board") of The Home Depot, Inc. (the "Company") adopted new forms of Executive Officer Equity Award Agreements (collectively, the "Award Agreements") with respect to the granting of performance shares, performance-based restricted stock, and nonqualified stock options granted under The Home Depot, Inc. Amended and Restated 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan. The new Award Agreements will be used for all awards to executive officers made on or after March 21, 2018. Each of the Award Agreements has material terms that are substantially similar to those in the forms of award agreements last approved by the LDCC and disclosed by the Company in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 8, 2016, except for the following items: (1) the broadening of the definition of "Cause" for employment termination to include a breach of the Company's code of conduct, including but not limited to policies prohibiting sexual harassment, discrimination, workplace violence, or threatened violence; (2) the expansion of the Company's clawback rights; (3) updates to the non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality provisions to align with similar provisions contained in the Company's current form of offer letter for its executive officers; and (4) other ministerial and conforming changes.

 The foregoing description of the Award Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Award Agreements, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 and incorporated herein by reference.
