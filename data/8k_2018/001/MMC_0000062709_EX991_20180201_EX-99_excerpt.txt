Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 

Three Months Ended December 31

(Millions) (Unaudited)

Overview

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (referred to in this release as "GAAP" or “reported” results). The Company also refers to and presents below certain additional non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These measures are: adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating margin, adjusted income, net of tax and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). The Company has included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP in the following tables.

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that enables investors to better compare the Company’s performance across periods. Management also uses these measures internally to assess the operating performance of its businesses, to assess performance for employee compensation purposes and to decide how to allocate resources. However, investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports in accordance with GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP measures include adjustments that reflect how management views our businesses, and may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.

Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Operating Margin

Adjusted operating income (loss) is calculated by excluding the impact of certain noteworthy items from the Company's GAAP operating income or loss. The following tables identify these noteworthy items and reconcile adjusted operating income (loss) to GAAP operating income or loss, on a consolidated and segment basis, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The following tables also present adjusted operating margin. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by consolidated or segment GAAP revenue less, where applicable, the net gain on the deconsolidation of Marsh's India subsidiary and the proceeds related to the disposal of Mercer's U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a) Includes severance and related charges from restructuring activities, adjustments to restructuring liabilities for future rent under

non-cancellable leases and other real estate costs, and restructuring costs related to the integration of recent acquisitions.

(b) Primarily includes the change in fair value as measured each quarter of contingent consideration related to acquisitions.

(c) Pension settlement charge resulting from lump sum settlements elected by participants in certain U.K. pension plans. Recognition of these payments as a partial settlement was required because in each respective plan the lump sum payments exceeded the total of interest and service cost for the year.

(d) Relates to net gain on the deconsolidation of Marsh India.

Adjusted income, net of tax and Adjusted Earnings per Share

Adjusted income, net of tax is calculated as the Company's GAAP income from continuing operations, adjusted to reflect the after-tax impact of the operating income adjustments set forth in the preceding tables and the impact related to recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation. Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing the Company’s adjusted income, net of tax, by MMC's average number of shares outstanding-diluted for the relevant period. The following tables reconcile adjusted income, net of tax to GAAP income from continuing operations and adjusted EPS to GAAP EPS for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

*The provisional estimates are based on the Company's initial analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"). Given the significant complexity of the Act, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the Act, and the potential for additional guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Accounting Standards Board related to the Act, these estimates may be adjusted during 2018.

Revised Presentation Under the New Retirement Benefits Accounting Standard

(Millions) (Unaudited)

On January 1, 2018, new accounting guidance became effective that changes the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost ("net benefit cost") under ASC 715. Under the new standard, the service cost component of net benefit cost will continue to be included in compensation and benefit costs in operating income. All other components of net benefit cost, which include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of gains and losses and settlements costs or credits, will be reported in a separate line item below operating income. This change in presentation will have no impact on income before income taxes, net income, earnings per share or cash flow. To aid investors in their understanding of these presentation changes, the tables below provide the restatements of both 2017 and 2016 results that will be reflected when the Company files its 2018 financial statements.
