98 Preliminary Reconciliation for the New Revenue Recognition Accounting Standard (ASC 606) Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the FASB-issued converged standard on revenue recognition, using the full retrospective method. Although the Company has not completed all of the analysis required to finalize this restatement of revenues and expenses relating to this new standard, the table below presents the Company’s current best estimate of the potential financial impact on its two segments’ revenue, and is being provided as a reference point for the Company’s guidance in 2018. The 2017 calculation is preliminary and will be finalized upon adoption in the first quarter of 2018 and the amounts are therefore subject to change. The Company does not believe the application of the new standard will have any significant impact on previously reported Adjusted Operating Income. However, the change in reported revenue will impact previously reported operating margins as shown in the table provided. (1) In LabCorp Diagnostics, the impact of the accounting change will reduce revenue and increase margins, as bad debt will be treated as a reduction in revenue rather than selling, general and administrative expense (2) In Covance Drug Development, the impact of this accounting change will increase revenue and cost of revenue, resulting in lower margins due to the inclusion of investigator fees and other pass-through expenses in both categories (Dollars in millions) As Reported Preliminary Restatement LabCorp Diagnostics (1) Net Revenue 7,170.5$ 6,858.0$ Adjusted Operating Income 1,446.3$ 1,446.3$ Adjusted Operating Margin 20.2% 21.1% Covance Drug Development (2) Net Revenue 3,037.2$ 3,562.4$ Adjusted Operating Income 422.4$ 425.7$ Adjusted Operating Margin 13.9% 11.9% Consolidated (1) (2) Net Revenue 10,205.9$ 10,418.6$ Adjusted Segment Operating Income 1,868.7$ 1,872.0$ Unallocated corporate expense (137.4)$ (137.4)$ Consolidated Adjusted Operating Income 1,731.3$ 1,734.6$ Adjusted Operating Margin 17.0% 16.6% Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017
