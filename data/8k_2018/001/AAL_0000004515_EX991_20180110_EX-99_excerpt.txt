Investor Relations Update

January 10, 2018 

General Overview 

•TRASM and Pre-tax Margin – The company expects its fourth quarter total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to be up 5.0 to 6.0 percent year-over-year, vs. previous guidance of up 2.5 to 4.5 percent year-over-year. The change in TRASM vs. previous guidance is due primarily to improving yields in all geographic regions and higher than expected domestic close-in bookings. In addition, the company expects its fourth quarter pre-tax margin excluding special items to be approximately 6.5 to 7.0 percent, vs. previous guidance of 4.5 to 6.5 percent.1 

•Special Items – The company expects its pre-tax net special items in the fourth quarter will approximate $315 million. Net special items include merger integration and fleet restructuring expenses, and the $1,000 cash bonus granted to eligible employees as of December 31, 2017 in recognition of recent tax reform. Additionally, the company expects to record a special $10 million non-cash credit to income tax expense in the fourth quarter to reflect the impact of recent tax reform on its deferred tax assets and liabilities.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Capacity – 2017 total system capacity was up approximately 1 percent vs. 2016. Full year domestic consolidated capacity was approximately flat year-over-year, while international capacity was up approximately 4 percent vs. 2016.

•Liquidity – As of December 31, 2017, the company had approximately $7.6 billion in total available liquidity, comprised of unrestricted cash and investments of $5.1 billion and $2.5 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. The company also had a restricted cash position of $318 million.

•Fuel – The company expects to pay an average of between $1.88 and $1.93 per gallon of mainline jet fuel (including taxes) in the fourth quarter.

•Cargo / Other Revenue – Includes cargo revenue, loyalty program revenue, ticket change fees, excess/overweight baggage fees, first and second bag fees, contract services, airport clubs and inflight service revenues.

•Taxes – As of December 31, 2016, the company had approximately $10.5 billion of federal net operating losses (NOLs) and $3.7 billion of state NOLs, substantially all of which are expected to be available in 2017 to reduce future federal and state taxable income. The company expects to recognize a provision for income taxes in 2017 at an effective rate of approximately 38 percent, which will be substantially non-cash.

Mainline Update

January 10, 2018 

Mainline Comments

•All operating expenses are for mainline operated flights only. Please refer to the following page for information pertaining to regional data.

•The year-over-year increase in mainline CASM excluding fuel and special items is primarily driven by salary and benefit increases provided to our team members (including the salary increases given to our pilots and flight attendants), higher revenue related expenses, and higher depreciation and amortization resulting from increased capex.

•2017 non-aircraft capex was approximately $1.8 billion, an increase from previous guidance due primarily to pulling forward expenditures related to the narrowbody retrofit program and facility improvements for our customers and team members.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation

January 10, 2018

The company sometimes uses financial measures that are derived from the consolidated financial statements but that are not presented in accordance with GAAP to understand and evaluate its current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. The company believes these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company is providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis. The table below presents the reconciliations of mainline and regional operating costs (GAAP measure) to mainline and regional operating costs excluding special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure). Management uses mainline and regional operating costs excluding special items and fuel to evaluate the company's current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which the company has no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. Additionally, special items may vary from period-to-period in nature and amount. These adjustments to exclude aircraft fuel and special items allow management an additional tool to better understand and analyze the company’s non-fuel costs and core operating performance. Additionally, the table below presents the reconciliation of other non-operating expense (GAAP measure) to other non-operating expense excluding special items (non-GAAP measure). Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate the company’s current performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. As special items may vary from period-to-period in nature and amount, the adjustment to exclude special items allows management an additional tool to better understand the company’s core performance.
