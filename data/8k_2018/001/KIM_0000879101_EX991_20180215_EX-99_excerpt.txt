 NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 15, 2018--Kimco Realty Corp. (NYSE:KIM) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.  

 Highlights - Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017:   

 A 10.1% increase in net income available to the company’s common shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2017 to $73.5 million, compared to $66.7 million during the same period in 2016.  

 Improved pro-rata occupancy to 96.0%, compared to the company’s historic record 96.2%, representing an increase of 20 basis points sequentially and 60 basis points from the fourth quarter 2016.  

 Generated new leasing spreads of 13.2% in the fourth quarter with overall rent spreads expanding 9.2% during the same period.  

 Leased over 10.0 million square feet in 2017 representing the highest leasing volume in the past 10 years.  

 Issued $230 million of 5.25% Class M cumulative redeemable preferred stock during the fourth quarter with an additional $34.5 million subsequently issued after the underwriters exercised their 30-day over-allotment option in January of 2018.  

 In February 2018, the company’s board approved a $300 million share repurchase program.   

 “We are pleased with the solid leasing spreads and positive operating results our team achieved in 2017. The strongest leasing activity in ten years raised our year-end occupancy to just shy of our all-time high, positioning us for continued success in 2018,” stated Conor Flynn, Chief Executive Officer of Kimco. “As we move forward, we will continue to build on these results while also taking steps to strengthen our portfolio in the rapidly changing retail environment.” Mr. Flynn continued, “Accelerating the divestiture of assets outside our core markets will allow us to concentrate our presence in target coastal markets, complete development projects underway and continue to invest in redevelopment, ultimately producing a stronger portfolio primed for sustained long-term growth.”  

 Financial Results  

 Net income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $73.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to $66.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2016.

 $43.9 million of lower charges associated with the early extinguishment of debt.  

 $23.7 million cash distribution in 2017 from the company’s investment in Albertsons LLC.  

 $63.5 million charge in 2016 for the merger of the company’s taxable REIT subsidiary (TRS).

 $7.0 million charge related to the partial preferred stock redemption in 2017.   

 NAREIT FFO was $160.1 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $163.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2016.

 Investment Activity  

 Dispositions:  

 During the fourth quarter, the company sold 16 shopping centers for a gross sales price of $234.2 million. Kimco’s share of the sales price was $174.0 million.  

 For the full year 2017, the company’s dispositions included 38 shopping centers and 3 land parcels, totaling 4.4 million square feet, for a gross sales price of $565.7 million. Kimco’s share of the sales price was $430.4 million.  

 In January of 2018, Kimco completed the sales of three shopping centers totaling over $30 million. Currently, the company has approximately $300 million of properties under contract or with an accepted offer, and over $475 million of properties being marketed.  

 Acquisitions:  

 During the fourth quarter, Kimco acquired one shopping center and two adjacent parcels totaling 845,000 square feet for $140.6 million, including $43.0 million of mortgage debt.  

 As previously announced during the fourth quarter, Kimco added Whittwood Town Center, a 783,000-square-foot, grocery-anchored open-air shopping center on a 54-acre infill site in the densely populated Los Angeles suburb of Whittier, California, to its Signature Series portfolio. The center features Target, Vons, PetSmart, Cost Plus and 24 Hour Fitness, in addition to Kohl’s, Sears and J.C. Penney, which pay substantially below-market rents, with an aggregate mark-to-market opportunity of 560%. The $123 million purchase price was funded with 1031 Exchange proceeds along with the assumption of $43 million in mortgage debt, which was completed in the fourth quarter despite the offer having been accepted in April 2017.  

 In 2017, Kimco acquired three shopping centers and ten land parcels for $382.1 million of which $377.4 million represents the company’s pro-rata share.  

 Capital Activity   

 Kimco repaid the remaining $89.0 million outstanding of its 4.30% Series E Medium-Term Notes due 2018 on November 1, 2017.  

 Issued $230.0 million of 5.25% Class M cumulative redeemable preferred stock comprised of 9,200,000 Class M depositary shares ($25 par) callable in December 2022. Subsequently, the company issued an additional $34.5 million of 5.25% Class M cumulative redeemable preferred stock after the underwriters exercised their 30-day over-allotment option in January of 2018.  

 In February 2018, Kimco’s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $300.0 million of the company’s common stock through February 28, 2020. Repurchases may be made at management’s discretion from time to time in the open market and, depending on market conditions and other factors, the program may be commenced or suspended without prior notice.   

 2018 Full Year Guidance  

  Net Income attributable to common shareholders (per diluted share):       $0.66 to $0.74   

  NAREIT FFO and FFO as adjusted (per diluted share):       $1.42 to $1.46   

 Reconciliations are provided for these forward-looking non-GAAP metrics (NAREIT FFO and FFO as adjusted) in the tables accompanying this press release.  

 Operating Assumptions:  

  Same-property NOI (excluding redevelopments):       1.25% to 2.00%   

  Net dispositions (7.50% to 8.00% blended cap rate):       $700 million to $900 million   

  Total redevelopment & development investment:       $425 million to $525 million   

 The following table outlines the key factors impacting 2018 FFO and FFO as adjusted guidance ranges, and accounts for the difference from the company’s 2017 reported FFO and FFO as adjusted:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  * U.S. GAAP relates to lower straight-line rent adjustments and the amortization of above and below market rent as well as reduced mark-to-market debt adjustments.   

  **2018 Net disposition activity assumes sales proceeds will fund 2018 redevelopment and development capital investment requirements. Additional sales proceeds may be used toward the reduction of debt, which would result in lower financing costs with the incremental savings reflected in the range presented for the 2018 Net disposition activity, or repurchasing the company’s common stock.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

 NAREIT FFO: A supplemental non-GAAP measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds from operations (“NAREIT FFO”) as net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), excluding (i) gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and change in control of interests, plus (ii) depreciation and amortization of operating properties and (iii) impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments and (iv) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect NAREIT FFO on the same basis.  

 The company considers NAREIT FFO an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present NAREIT FFO when reporting results. Comparison of our presentation of NAREIT FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.  

 FFO as Adjusted: A supplemental non-GAAP measure that the company believes is more reflective of its core operating performance and provides investors and analysts an additional measure to compare the company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. FFO as adjusted is generally calculated by the Company as NAREIT FFO excluding certain transactional income and expenses and non-operating impairments which management believes are not reflective of the results within the company’s operating real estate portfolio.  

 Same-Property NOI: A supplemental non-GAAP measure of real estate companies’ operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The company considers same-property NOI as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods. It excludes properties under development and pending stabilization; properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a projects inclusion in operating real estate. Same-property NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the Company's properties.  

 Same-property NOI is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees, amortization of above/below market rents and includes charges for bad debt) less operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company’s proportionate share of same-property NOI from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. The company’s method of calculating same-property NOI may differ from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.

  (1) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. The impact of the conversion would have an anti-dilutive effect on net income and therefore have not been included.   

  (2) Adjusted for earnings attributable from participating securities of ($536) and ($524) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and ($2,132) and ($2,018) for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

  (1) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Funds from operations would be increased by $274 and $229 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and $923 and $881 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.   

  (2) Related to gains, impairments and depreciation on operating properties, where applicable.   

  FFO is a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT). Given the company’s business as a real estate owner and operator, Kimco believes that FFO and FFO as adjusted is helpful to investors as a measure of its operating performance. NAREIT defines FFO as net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, excluding (i) gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and change in control of interests and (ii) extraordinary items, plus (iii) depreciation and amortization of operating properties and (iv) impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments. Included in these items are also the company’s share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships. FFO as adjusted excludes the effects of non-operating impairments, transactional income and expenses.   

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  Same Property NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. Same Property NOI is considered by management to be important performance measure of Kimco's operations, and management believes that this measure is frequently used by securities analysts and investors as a measure of Kimco's operating performance as this measure includes only the net operating income of properties that have been owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods including those properties under redevelopment and exclude properties under development and pending stabilization. As such, Same Property NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular periods presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the operating performance of Kimco's properties.   

  Same Property NOI is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees and above/below market rents) less charges for bad debt, less operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense, plus Kimco's proportionate share of Same Property NOI from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. Same Property NOI includes all properties that are owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods and excludes properties under development and properties pending stabilization. Properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following their inclusion in operating real estate. Kimco’s method of calculating Same Property NOI may differ from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.   

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  Projections involve numerous assumptions such as rental income (including assumptions on percentage rent), interest rates, tenant defaults, occupancy rates, foreign currency exchange rates (such as the US-Canadian rate), selling prices of properties held for disposition, expenses (including salaries and employee costs), insurance costs and numerous other factors. Not all of these factors are determinable at this time and actual results may vary from the projected results, and may be above or below the range indicated. The above range represents management’s estimate of results based upon these assumptions as of the date of this press release.
