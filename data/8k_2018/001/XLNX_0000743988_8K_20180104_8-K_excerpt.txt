Employment Agreement with Victor Peng

Effective as of January 29, 2018, the Company entered into an Employment Agreement (the “Peng Agreement”) with Mr. Peng providing for Mr. Peng’s employment with the Company as President and Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the terms of the Peng Agreement, Mr. Peng will receive an annual salary of $700,000, and beginning with the Company’s fiscal year ending March 30, 2019, will be eligible for an annual target bonus of one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of his base salary based upon achievement of target performance objectives determined by the Compensation Committee. Pursuant to the Peng Agreement, Mr. Peng will receive a bonus for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 based on the terms applicable to him in his previous role with the Company and prorated such that the bonus for the period from January 29, 2018 until March 31, 2018 will be based on a target bonus of one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of Mr. Peng’s $700,000 per year base salary from January 29, 2018. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Peng Agreement, Mr. Peng will be granted restricted stock units pursuant to the Company’s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan having a grant value equal to $1,000,000 (the “Initial Grant”), subject to terms and conditions more fully described in the Peng Agreement. The shares subject to the Initial Grant vest over four (4) years, with twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of shares vesting annually on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversary of the date of Initial Grant. Pursuant to the terms of the Peng Agreement, Mr. Peng will be granted performance-based restricted stock units in respect of fiscal year 2019 having a total grant target value at least equal to $4,500,000 (the “2019 PRSU Grant”).

The Peng Agreement provides that if (1) the Company terminates Mr. Peng's employment at any time with Cause (as such term is defined in the Peng Agreement), (2) Mr. Peng voluntarily terminates his employment other than for Good Reason (as such term is defined in the Peng Agreement) or (3) Mr. Peng dies, Mr. Peng will be entitled to his base salary accrued through the date of termination of employment. Additionally, if then serving on the Board, Mr. Peng will be required to tender his resignation as a member of the Board if so requested.

The Peng Agreement also provides that if the Company terminates Mr. Peng's employment at any time (A) other than for Cause or (B) due to a Disability (as such term is defined in the Peng Agreement), or if Mr. Peng voluntarily terminates his employment for Good Reason, then, subject to Mr. Peng executing a release of claims in favor of the Company, Mr. Peng will be entitled to: (a) a lump sum payment equal to the sum of twelve (12) months base salary plus one year of target bonus, together with any base salary accrued through the termination date; (b) at the Company’s election, either a lump sum payment equal to the value of twelve (12) months of COBRA coverage or direct payment of premiums for health care continuation coverage under the applicable provisions of COBRA (the “COBRA Benefit”), provided that Mr. Peng elects to continue and remain eligible for these benefits under COBRA and does not become covered through another employer’s health plan during this period; (c) twenty-four (24) months accelerated vesting of the Initial Grant, the 2019 PRSU Grant and all other equity awards received from the Company prior to such termination of employment, as more fully explained in the Peng 

Agreement; and (d) a pro rata portion of his bonus for the fiscal year during which his employment was terminated, as more fully explained in the Peng Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such termination occurs within the period commencing 90 days before, or two years following, the consummation of a Change of Control (as such term is defined in the Peng Agreement), then Mr. Peng will be entitled to: (a) twenty-four (24) months of base salary and two (2) years of target bonus, payable in a lump sum; (b) 100% accelerated vesting of time-based equity compensation awards, including the Initial Grant and the 2019 PRSU Grant; (c) 100% vesting of the target number of any then-unearned performance-based restricted stock unit awards; (d) the COBRA Benefit and (e) a pro rata portion of his bonus for the fiscal year during which his employment was terminated. To the extent the Initial Grant or the 2019 PRSU Grant is not assumed, continued or substituted in a Change of Control, then the vesting of the Initial Grant will accelerate in full immediately prior to the Change of Control and the 2019 PRSU Grant will accelerate in full at target immediately prior to the Change of Control. Additionally, if then serving on the Board, Mr. Peng will be required to tender his resignation as a member of the Board if so requested.

The foregoing summary of the Peng Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Peng Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
