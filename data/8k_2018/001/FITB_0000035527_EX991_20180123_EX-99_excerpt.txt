Net Interest Income  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Taxable equivalent net interest income of $963 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 was down $14 million, or 1 percent from the prior quarter, primarily due to the $27 million impact from the leveraged lease remeasurement described on page 1. Excluding the remeasurement, taxable equivalent net interest income of $990 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 was up $13 million, or 1 percent from the prior quarter, reflecting higher interest earning asset yields as well as the continued shift into higher yielding consumer loans. The taxable equivalent net interest margin of 3.02 percent was negatively impacted 8 bps from the aforementioned remeasurement. The adjusted taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.10 percent, up 3 bps sequentially, primarily driven by higher securities portfolio and consumer loan yields, partially offset by an increase in funding costs associated with deposit rate changes and the full quarter impact of an auto securitization executed in third quarter of 2017.  

Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, taxable equivalent net interest income was up $54 million, or 6 percent, primarily driven by higher short-term market rates and the $16 million estimated card refund charge during the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by the aforementioned leveraged lease remeasurement. Excluding the leveraged lease remeasurement and the estimated card refund charge, adjusted taxable equivalent net interest income was up 7 percent. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher short-term market rates. The taxable equivalent net interest margin increased 16 bps from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily driven by higher short-term market rates and a 5 bps positive impact from the estimated card refund charge, partially offset by a negative 8 bps impact from the leveraged lease remeasurement. Excluding the remeasurement and card refunds impact, adjusted taxable equivalent net interest margin was up 19 bps from the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher-short-term market rates.

Securities  

Average securities and other short-term investments were $33.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $33.8 billion in the previous quarter and $32.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Available-for-sale securities were $31.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 up $340 million, or 1 percent, sequentially and up $637 million, or 2 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Loans  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average portfolio loan and lease balances were flat sequentially and decreased 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Sequential performance was primarily driven by increases in commercial real estate and other consumer loans and leases, offset by decreases in home equity and automobile loans. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by declines in commercial and industrial (C&I) and automobile loans, partially offset by increases in commercial real estate and other consumer loans and leases. Period end portfolio loans and leases of $92.0 billion were flat sequentially and year-over-year.  

Average commercial portfolio loan and lease balances were flat sequentially, and decreased 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Sequential performance was primarily driven by an increase in commercial real estate loans, offset by a decrease in commercial leases. Average C&I loans were flat sequentially and decreased 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decline in C&I loans was primarily due to deliberate exits from certain C&I loans that did not meet our targeted risk or return profile. Average commercial real estate loans increased $71 million, or 1 percent, from the prior quarter and increased $564 million, or 5 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016. Period end commercial line utilization of 34 percent was flat from both the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016.  

5  

Average consumer portfolio loan and lease balances were up 1 percent sequentially and decreased 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential increase was primarily driven by the increase in other consumer loans and leases, partially offset by a decline in average home equity loans. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the decline in average automobile loans which continues to reflect a decision to reduce lower-return originations to improve returns on capital.  

Deposits  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average core deposits increased 2 percent sequentially and decreased 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Average transaction deposits increased 2 percent sequentially and decreased 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential increase was primarily driven by increases in commercial interest checking deposit and commercial demand deposit account balances, partially offset by lower consumer savings and commercial money market account balances. Year-over-year performance was primarily driven by lower commercial money market and commercial demand deposit account balances, largely offset by higher consumer money market and commercial interest checking deposit account balances. Other time deposits increased by 2 percent sequentially and decreased 4 percent year-over-year.  

Average total commercial transaction deposits of $43 billion increased 4 percent sequentially and decreased 4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Average total consumer transaction deposits of $53 billion were flat sequentially and increased 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.  

6  

Wholesale Funding  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average wholesale funding of $20.1 billion decreased $1.4 billion, or 7 percent, sequentially and was flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential decline was primarily due to a decrease in other short-term borrowings reflecting higher core deposit balances, partially offset by an increase in long-term debt from 3-year bank debt issued in October of 2017. The year-over-year results reflect an increase in other short-term borrowings, largely offset by a decrease in long-term debt.  

Noninterest Income  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Noninterest income of $577 million decreased $984 million sequentially and decreased $43 million compared with prior year results. The sequential and year-over-year comparisons reflect the impact of the following items.  

7  

Noninterest Income excluding certain items  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Excluding the items in the table above, noninterest income of $587 million was up 3 percent from the previous quarter and decreased 3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential increase was primarily due to $44 million in revenue recognized from Vantiv related to the tax receivable agreement in the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase in wealth and asset management revenue. This was partially offset by declines in corporate banking and mortgage banking revenue. Corporate banking revenue was negatively impacted by a $25 million lease remarketing impairment in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease was driven by lower corporate banking and mortgage banking revenue.  

Corporate banking revenue of $77 million was down 24 percent both sequentially and year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year decreases were primarily driven by the aforementioned lease remarketing impairment. Excluding the impact of the lease impairment, corporate banking revenue was flat sequentially and year-over-year.  

Mortgage Banking Net Revenue  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Mortgage banking net revenue was $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, down $9 million from the third quarter of 2017 and down $11 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential decrease was driven by lower origination fees and gains on loan sales. The year-over-year decrease was driven by a reduction in net valuation adjustments (including MSR amortization) of $19 million. Originations of $1.9 billion in the current quarter decreased 10 percent sequentially and decreased 30 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.  

8  

Wealth and asset management revenue of $106 million increased 4 percent from the third quarter of 2017 and increased 6 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential and year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher personal asset management revenue.  

Card and processing revenue of $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 was up 1 percent both sequentially and year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year performance reflected increased credit card spend volume, largely offset by higher rewards.  

Other noninterest income totaled $123 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $1.076 billion in the previous quarter and $137 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The reported results included Vantiv-related transactions and adjustments and the valuation of the Visa total return swap in the table on page 8. For the fourth quarter of 2017, excluding these items, other noninterest income of $134 million increased approximately $48 million, or 56 percent, from the third quarter of 2017 and increased $12 million, or 10 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential increase was primarily due to the $44 million in revenue recognized from Vantiv related to the tax receivable agreement in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase was due to an $11 million increase in the aforementioned tax receivable agreement.  

Net gains on investment securities were $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with no gains or losses in the third quarter of 2017 and a $3 million net loss in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net gains/losses on securities held as non-qualifying hedges for the MSR portfolio were net losses of $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and net gains of $2 million in the third quarter of 2017.  

Noninterest Expense  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Noninterest expense of $1.073 billion increased $98 million, or 10 percent, compared with the third quarter of 2017, and increased $113 million, or 12 percent, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Results reflected the affordable housing impairment, one-time employee bonuses, and the Fifth Third Foundation contribution referenced on page 2. Excluding these items, noninterest expense of $975 million was flat compared with the third quarter of 2017, impacted by lower other noninterest expense and salaries, wages and incentives, offset by higher employee benefits and technology and communications expense. Excluding the aforementioned items, noninterest expense increased 2 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, impacted by higher employee benefits and technology and communications expense, offset by lower other noninterest expense.

Summary of Credit Loss Experience  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net charge-offs were $76 million, or 33 bps of average portfolio loans and leases on an annualized basis, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with net charge-offs of $68 million, or 29 bps, in the third quarter of 2017 and $73 million, or 31 bps, in the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Commercial net charge-offs of $32 million, or 22 bps, increased $2 million sequentially. This primarily reflected a $5 million increase in net charge-offs of C&I loans, partially offset by a $4 million reduction in net charge-offs of commercial mortgage loans.  

Consumer net charge-offs of $44 million, or 51 bps, increased $6 million sequentially. This primarily reflected a $2 million increase in net charge-offs on residential mortgage loans and the automobile loans.  

10  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, flat sequentially, reflecting improvement in criticized assets and nonperforming loans, offset by an increase in net charge-offs and higher period-end portfolio loan balances. Provision expense increased $13 million from the fourth quarter of 2016.  

As of quarter end, the allowance for loan and lease loss ratio represented 1.30 percent of total portfolio loans and leases outstanding, compared with 1.31 percent last quarter, and represented 274 percent of nonperforming loans and leases, and 245 percent of nonperforming assets.

Fifth Third entered into or completed multiple share repurchases during the quarter. Below is a summary of those share repurchases.  

   •   On December 18, 2017, Fifth Third settled the forward contract related to the August 15, 2017 $990 million share repurchase agreement. An additional 4.3 million shares were repurchased in connection with the completion of this agreement.  

   •   On December 19, 2017, Fifth Third initially settled a share repurchase agreement whereby Fifth Third would purchase $273 million of its outstanding stock. This reduced fourth quarter common shares outstanding by 7.7 million shares. Settlement of the forward contract related to this agreement is expected to occur on or before March 19, 2018.  

In total, common shares outstanding decreased by approximately 11.7 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the third quarter of 2017.  

Tax Rate  

An income tax benefit was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was a result of the new tax legislation and was primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities at the lower statutory rate. The benefit was partially offset by a tax expense related to a gain on the sale of Vantiv shares sold in the prior quarter. The prior quarter’s tax rate was also impacted by the aforementioned gain on the sale of Vantiv shares. On a full year basis, the 2017 effective rate was 20.8 percent compared with 24.4 percent for the full year of 2016.  

13  

Other  

As of December 31, 2017, Fifth Third Bank owned approximately 15 million units representing an 8.6 percent interest in Vantiv Holding, LLC, convertible into shares of Vantiv, Inc., a publicly traded firm. Based upon Vantiv’s closing price of $73.55 on December 31, 2017, our interest in Vantiv was valued at approximately $1.1 billion.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In addition to GAAP measures, management considers various Non-GAAP measures when evaluating the performance of the business, including: “taxable equivalent net interest income,” “adjusted taxable equivalent net interest income,” “taxable equivalent net interest margin,” “adjusted taxable equivalent net interest margin,” “adjusted yield on interest-earning assets,” “efficiency ratio,” “taxable equivalent income before income taxes,” “noninterest income excluding certain items,” “tangible net income available to common shareholders,” “average tangible common equity,” “tangible common equity ratio,” “tangible common equity ratio (excluding unrealized gains/ losses)” “tangible common equity ratio (including unrealized gains/ losses)” “tangible equity,” “tangible book value per share,” and certain ratios derived from these measures.  

The taxable equivalent basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.  

Noninterest income excluding certain items is provided by management to assist the reader in identifying significant, unusual, or large transactions that impacted noninterest income. Adjusted taxable equivalent net interest income and adjusted taxable equivalent net interest margin are provided by management to assist the reader in identifying significant, unusual, or large transactions that impacted net interest income.  

Management considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity and tangible common equity (including and excluding unrealized gains/losses), in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be Non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that providing the tangible common equity ratio excluding unrealized gains/losses on certain assets and liabilities enables investors and others to assess the Bancorp’s use of equity without the effects of gains or losses some of which are uncertain and providing the tangible common equity ratio including unrealized gains/losses enables investors and others to assess the Bancorp’s use of equity if all unrealized gains or losses were to be monetized.  

Management believes tangible book value per share and return on average tangible common equity are important measures for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders and book value of common stock without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. This is useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally, compared to other companies in the industry who present similar measures.  

Please note that although Non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight, they should not be considered in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for analysis using GAAP measures.  

Please see page 31 for Reg. G reconciliations of all historical Non-GAAP measures used in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
