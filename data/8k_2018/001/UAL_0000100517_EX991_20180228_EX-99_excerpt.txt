NON-GAAP FINANCIAL RECONCILIATION (UNAUDITED)  

(A) UAL evaluates its financial performance utilizing various accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and Non-GAAP financial measures, including operating margin, excluding special charges, pre-tax margin, excluding special charges and hedge adjustments, operating income (loss) excluding special charges, operating expenses, excluding fuel, profit sharing, special charges and third-party business expenses, income (loss) before income taxes excluding special charges and reflecting hedge adjustments, net income (loss) excluding special charges and reflecting hedge adjustments and income tax adjustments, net earnings (loss) per share excluding special charges and income tax adjustments and reflecting hedge adjustments, and consolidated unit cost per available seat mile (“CASM”), excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing, among others.  

CASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline’s cost structure and efficiency. UAL reports CASM excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges is useful to investors because special charges are non-recurring charges not indicative of UAL’s ongoing performance. UAL also believes that excluding third-party business expenses, such as maintenance, ground handling and catering services for third parties, fuel sales and non-air mileage redemptions, provides more meaningful disclosure because these expenses are not directly related to UAL’s core business. UAL also believes that excluding fuel costs from certain measures is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management’s performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item over which management has limited influence. UAL excludes profit sharing because this exclusion allows investors to better understand and analyze UAL’s recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of UAL’s core operating costs to the airline industry. In addition, UAL believes that adjusting for prior period gains and losses on fuel derivative contracts settled in the current period is useful because the adjustments allow investors to better understand the cash impact of settled fuel derivative contracts in a given period.  

The following tables show adjusted reconciliations of certain previously reported Non-GAAP financial measures to comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis after the adoption of Topic 606 and ASU 2017-07 for each quarter of 2017 and for the full year, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
