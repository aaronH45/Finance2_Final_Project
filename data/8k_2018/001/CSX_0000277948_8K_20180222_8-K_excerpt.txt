On February 22, 2018, CSX Corporation (“CSX”) extended the expiration date of the CSX Section 16 Officer Severance Plan (the “Severance Plan”) to February 22, 2019 for certain of the Company’s executive officers, including Andrew L. Glassman, Nathan D. Goldman and Frank A. Lonegro. Each of the Company’s other Section 16 officers have severance coverage under separate employment agreements.  

The Severance Plan provides eligible employees with severance payments and benefits in the event that an eligible employee’s employment with the Company or one of the Company’s subsidiaries is terminated on or before February 22, 2019 either (a) involuntarily by the Company for any reason other than “for cause”, or (b) voluntarily by the eligible employee for “good reason”. The severance payments and benefits to be provided, subject to the employee’s execution of a release of claims, are as follows (1) a lump sum cash payment equal to two times the employee’s then base salary, (2) a lump sum payment of one times the employee’s target bonus for the year of separation, (3) credit for an additional three years of age and two years of service for purposes of calculating the employee’s pension benefit and (4) pro-rata vesting of the employee’s unvested equity awards with any performance-based awards remaining subject to satisfaction of pre-established performance goals.  

The foregoing description of the Severance Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Severance Plan, which is attached as Exhibit 10.4 to the Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 27, 2017 and incorporated herein by reference.
