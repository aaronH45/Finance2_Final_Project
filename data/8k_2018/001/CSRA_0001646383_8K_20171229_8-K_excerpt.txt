Pursuant to the Third Amendment, among other things, (a) the maturities of the Tranche A2 Facility and the Revolving Facility (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) were extended for a period of one year and (b) the Company incurred incremental term loan B advances in an aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000, which resulted in an increase in the unpaid aggregate principal balance of the Term Loan B Facility (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (after giving effect to the repayment of advances under the Term Loan B Facility made on the Third Amendment Effective Date) to a total of $849,000,000. A portion of the additional borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility was immediately applied to repay in full the balance of the aggregate principal amount of the advances under the Revolving Facility outstanding immediately prior to the Third Amendment Effective Date in the aggregate amount of $150,000,000 and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Third Amendment and the transactions contemplated thereby. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for quarterly amortization payments with respect to the Term Loan B Facility of $1,000,000 commencing March 31, 2018 through December 31, 2022 and quarterly amortization payments thereafter of $3,250,000 until the maturity date of the Term Loan B Facility, subject to reduction as a result of the application of voluntary or mandatory prepayments made by the Company.
