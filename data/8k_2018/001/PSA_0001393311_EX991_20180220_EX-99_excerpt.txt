 Public Storage Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2017  

 GLENDALE, California – Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) announced today operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.   

 Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017  

 For the three months ended December 31, 2017, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $334.1 million or $1.92 per diluted common share, compared to $352.8 million or $2.03 in 2016 representing a decrease of $18.7 million or $0.11.  The decrease primarily reflects (i) a $29.2 million reduction due to the impact of foreign exchange translation gains and losses associated with our euro denominated debt and (ii) a $7.2 million increase in interest expense associated with higher outstanding debt balances offset partially by (iii) a $13.8 million increase in self-storage net operating income (described below).  

 The $13.8 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $8.7 million increase in our Same Store Facilities (as defined below) and a $5.1 million increase in our Non Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 2.1% or $11.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 2.6% or $2.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016, due primarily to increased property manager payroll and repairs and maintenance costs, offset partially by reduced advertising and selling costs. The increase in net operating income for the Non Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of 345 self-storage facilities acquired, developed or expanded since January 2015.   

 Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017  

 In 2017, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1,171.6 million or $6.73 per diluted common share, compared to $1,183.9 million or $6.81 per share in 2016 representing a decrease of $12.3 million or $0.08.  The decrease primarily reflects  (i) a $67.6 million reduction due to the impact of foreign exchange translation gains and losses associated with our euro denominated debt, (ii) an $8.5 million increase in interest expense associated with higher outstanding debt balances and (iii) a $7.8 million casualty loss and $5.2 million in incremental tenant reinsurance losses related to Hurricane Harvey and Irma offset partially by (iv) a $66.9 million increase in self-storage net operating income (described below) and (v) an $18.9 million increase in our equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities.  

 The $66.9 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $44.6 million increase in our Same Store Facilities and a $22.3 million increase in our Non Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 3.0% or $63.0 million in 2017 as compared to 2016, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 3.4% or $18.4 million in 2017 as compared to 2016, due primarily to increased property taxes, advertising and selling expense and repairs and maintenance costs, offset partially by lower snow removal costs. The increase in net operating income for the Non Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of 345 self-storage facilities acquired, developed or expanded since January 2015.  

 Funds from Operations  

 For the three months ended December 31, 2017, funds from operations (“FFO”) was $2.70 per diluted common share, as compared to $2.77 in 2016, representing a decrease of 2.5%. FFO is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and generally represents net income before depreciation, gains and losses and impairment charges with respect to real estate assets.  

 1  

For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, FFO was flat at $9.70 per diluted common share.  

 We also present “Core FFO per share,” a non-GAAP measure that represents FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (ii) EITF D-42 charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, (iii) reversals of accruals with respect to share based awards forfeited by executive officers and (iv) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items. We review Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance, and we believe it is used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However, Core FFO per share is not a substitute for net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology or may not present such a measure, Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.  

 The following table reconciles from FFO per share to Core FFO per share (unaudited):

 Property Operations – Same Store Facilities  

 The Same Store Facilities represent those facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy, revenues and cost of operations since January 1, 2015. We review the operations of our Same Store Facilities, which excludes facilities whose operating trends are significantly affected by factors such as casualty events, as well as recently developed or acquired facilities, to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2015, 2016 and 2017. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2,042 facilities (130.3 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 82% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2017.

   (a)    Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance and retail sales. 

   (b)    See attached reconciliation of self-storage net operating income (“NOI”) to operating income.  

   (c)    Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income.

   (d)    Contract rent represents the applicable contractual monthly rent charged to our tenants, excluding the impact of promotional discounts, late charges and administrative fees.
