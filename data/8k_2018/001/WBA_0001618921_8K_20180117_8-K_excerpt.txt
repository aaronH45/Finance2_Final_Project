 Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

(e) As described in Item 5.07 below, at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (the “Company”) held on January 17, 2018, stockholders approved the amended and restated Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Incentive Plan”). Upon a delegation from the Company’s Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee had previously approved the amended and restated Omnibus Incentive Plan on July 11, 2017, subject to stockholder approval. Stockholders of Walgreen Co., the Company’s predecessor, previously approved the initial adoption of the Omnibus Incentive Plan (then called the Walgreen Co. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan) on January 9, 2013.  

The Omnibus Incentive Plan provides for a variety of equity and other awards as a tool for the Company to, among other things, attract, retain, motivate, and reward executives and other employees, as well as non-employee directors and other persons who provide substantial services to us and our affiliates; to provide for equitable and competitive compensation opportunities, including deferral opportunities; to encourage long-term service; to recognize individual contributions and reward achievement of Company goals; and to promote the creation of long-term stockholder value by closely aligning the interests of participants with those of the Company’s stockholders. The amended and restated Omnibus Incentive Plan added an aggregate limit on the cash and equity compensation awarded to any non-employee director in a single fiscal year, and implemented various administrative amendments.  

A more detailed description of the Omnibus Incentive Plan and related matters was set forth in the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 29, 2017 under the heading “Proposal 5: Approval of the Amended and Restated Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan” and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, and the summary of the Omnibus Incentive Plan set forth in the proxy statement, are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
