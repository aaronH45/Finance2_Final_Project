        "We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, pay dividends, repurchase stock or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity. For forward looking information, management cannot reliably predict or estimate, without unreasonable effort, the separation costs given the preliminary nature of the estimates or the amounts from Tax Reform as the charges are provisional. We therefore do not include an estimate for the separation costs or impacts from Tax Reform in this reconciliation."
