Pawtucket, R.I., February 7, 2018 -- Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ: HAS) today reported financial results for the full-year and fourth quarter 2017. Net revenues for the full-year 2017 increased 4% to $5.21 billion versus $5.02 billion in 2016. 2017 net revenues include a favorable $79.2 million impact from foreign exchange.  

As reported net earnings for the full-year 2017 of $396.6 million, or $3.12 per diluted share, compared to $551.4 million, or $4.34 per diluted share in 2016. Adjusted 2017 net earnings were $693.1 million, or $5.46 per diluted share, excluding a $296.5 million, or $2.33 per diluted share, impact from U.S. tax reform. Adjusted net earnings for the full-year 2016 were $566.1 million, or $4.46 per diluted share, excluding a post-tax $14.7 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, non-cash fourth quarter 2016 goodwill impairment charge related to Backflip Studios.  

In December 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that provided significant changes to the U.S. tax code, including a one-time repatriation tax payable over eight years. As a result of the Act, the Company recognized a net charge of $296.5 million. Given the significant complexities associated with the changes in the U.S. tax code, the estimated financial impact for the fourth-quarter and full year 2017 are provisional and subject to further analysis which could result in changes to this estimate during 2018 as further guidance is issued. 

2017 net earnings also include a $0.25 per diluted share benefit versus full-year 2016 from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  

“Hasbro’s global team’s execution of our Brand Blueprint drove revenue gains in Franchise Brands, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands, including immersive brand experiences across consumer products and digital gaming,” said Brian Goldner, Hasbro’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Our strong performance ranked Hasbro #1 across the G11 markets for the full-year 20171. In the fourth quarter, Hasbro Franchise Brand revenues increased 11%. However, overall consumer demand slowed in November and December both for the industry and for Hasbro. A decline in Partner Brands and Europe revenues resulted in us not meeting our fourth quarter revenue expectations. Looking ahead, our innovative lines are supported by robust storytelling and digital initiatives that position us well for 2018 and beyond.” 

“Over the past five years, we added over $1 billion in revenues to our top line, growing revenues four consecutive years, while meaningfully increasing operating profit, net earnings and generating significant cash flow,” said Deborah Thomas, Hasbro’s Chief Financial Officer. “Hasbro is in a strong financial position with the cash and profitability to invest in growing our business for the long term. Our team’s excellent job of understanding and assessing the global tax environment and managing associated risks contributed to strong underlying net earnings growth. In addition, our 2017 year-end results include an estimate for the expense associated with U.S. tax reform. We expect an on-going benefit to our tax rate in future periods and will discuss this further at our Toy Fair Investor Event.”

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Note: Full-year 2016 Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit includes a pre-tax $32.9 million fourth quarter 2016 non-cash goodwill impairment charge.

The U.S. and Canada segment operating profit declined 2% to $509.9 million, or 19.0% of net revenues, compared to $522.3 million, or 20.4% of net revenues in 2016, primarily driven by increased advertising as well as higher bad debt expense related to the Toys“R”Us bankruptcy filing in the third quarter of 2017.

Entertainment and Licensing segment net revenues increased 8% to $285.6 million compared to $265.2 million in 2016. Full-year gains were driven by growth in consumer products and digital gaming, as well as the addition of Boulder Media.

Partner Brand revenues decreased in the U.S. and Canada and International segments. 

Hasbro Gaming net revenues grew 10% to $893.0 million. Hasbro’s diverse gaming portfolio includes a broad spectrum of gaming experiences from face-to-face gaming, social gaming and digital gaming.

These statements include expectations concerning the Company’s potential performance in the future and the Company’s ability to achieve its financial and business goals and may be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases. The Company's actual actions or results may differ materially from those expected or anticipated in the forward-looking statements due to both known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Specific factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the Company's ability to design, develop, produce, manufacture, source and ship products on a timely and cost-effective basis, as well as interest in and purchase of those products by retail customers and consumers in quantities and at prices that will be sufficient to recover the Company’s costs and earn a profit; (ii) downturns in economic conditions  

impacting one or more of the markets in which the Company sells products, such as the economic downturns which impacted the United Kingdom and Brazil in 2017, which can negatively impact the Company’s retail customers and consumers, and which can result in lower employment levels, lower consumer disposable income, lower retailer inventories and lower spending, including lower spending on purchases of the Company’s products; (iii) other factors which can lower discretionary consumer spending, such as higher costs for fuel and food, drops in the value of homes or other consumer assets, and high levels of consumer debt; (iv) consumer interest in entertainment properties, such as motion pictures, for which the Company is developing and marketing products, and the ability to drive sales of products associated with such entertainment properties, (v) potential difficulties or delays the Company may experience in implementing cost savings and efficiency enhancing initiatives; (vi) other economic and public health conditions or regulatory changes in the markets in which the Company and its customers and suppliers operate which could create delays or increase the Company’s costs, such as higher commodity prices, labor costs or transportation costs, or outbreaks of disease; (vii) currency fluctuations, including movements in foreign exchange rates, which can lower the Company’s net revenues and earnings, and significantly impact the Company’s costs; (viii) the concentration of the Company's customers, potentially increasing the negative impact to the Company of difficulties experienced by any of the Company’s customers or changes in their purchasing or selling patterns; (ix) consumer interest in and acceptance of the Discovery Family Channel, and programming created by Hasbro Studios, and other factors impacting the financial performance of the network and Hasbro Studios; (x) the inventory policies of the Company’s retail customers, including retailers’ potential decisions to lower their inventories, even if it results in lost sales, as well as the concentration of the Company's revenues in the second half and fourth quarter of the year, which coupled with reliance by retailers on quick response inventory management techniques increases the risk of underproduction of popular items, overproduction of less popular items and failure to achieve compressed shipping schedules; (xi) delays, increased costs or difficulties associated with any of our or our partners’ planned digital applications or media initiatives; (xii) work disruptions, which may impact the Company's ability to manufacture or deliver product in a timely and cost-effective manner; (xiii) the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Company's significant retailers, such as the bankruptcy of Toys “R” Us in the United States and Canada in the fourth quarter of 2017, which could negatively impact the Company's revenues or bad debt exposure; (xiv) the impact of competition on revenues, margins and other aspects of the Company's business, including the ability to offer Company products which consumers choose to buy instead of competitive products, the ability to secure, maintain and renew popular licenses and the ability to attract and retain talented employees; (xv) concentration of manufacturing for many of the Company’s products in the People’s Republic of China and the associated impact to the Company of social, economic or public health conditions and other factors affecting China, the movement of products into and out of China, the cost of producing products in China and exporting them to other countries; (xvi) the risk of product recalls or product liability suits and costs associated with product safety regulations; (xvii) the impact of other market conditions, third party actions or approvals and competition which could reduce demand for the Company’s products or delay or increase the cost of implementation of the Company's programs or alter the Company's actions and reduce actual results; (xviii) changes in tax laws or regulations, or the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations, such as what may occur as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is interpreted and applied, which may cause the Company to alter tax reserves or make other changes which significantly impact its reported financial results; (xix) the impact of litigation or arbitration decisions or settlement actions; and (xx) other risks and uncertainties as may be detailed from time to time in the Company's public announcements and Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings. The Company undertakes no obligation to make any revisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this release or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this release. 

This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules, specifically Adjusted net earnings and earnings per share, excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform in 2017 and the impact of a goodwill impairment charge associated with Backflip Studios in 2016, as well as adjusted operating profit absent the impact of the goodwill impairment charge. Also included in the financial tables attached to this release are the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA represents net earnings attributable to Hasbro, Inc. excluding net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the impact of re-measuring a liability as a result of U.S. tax reform in 2017 and the impact of a goodwill impairment charge in 2016. As required by SEC rules, we have provided reconciliation on the attached schedule of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that Adjusted net earnings, Adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating profit absent the impact of U.S. tax reform and the goodwill impairment charge provides investors with an understanding of the underlying performance of the Company’s business absent these unusual events. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate measures for evaluating the operating performance of the Company because they reflect the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, strengthen the balance sheet and make strategic acquisitions. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net earnings or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP as more fully discussed in the Company's financial statements and filings with the SEC. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
