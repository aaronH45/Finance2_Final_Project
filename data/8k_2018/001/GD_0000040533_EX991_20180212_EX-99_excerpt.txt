Forward-looking statements are based on management’s expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual future results and trends may differ materially from what is forecast in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made. The company does not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this presentation. Notice to Investors The tender offer described in this presentation has not yet commenced. This presentation is not a recommendation, an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell shares of CSRA stock. At the time the tender offer is commenced, Red Hawk Enterprises Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the company (“Merger Sub”), will file a tender offer statement and related exhibits with the SEC and CSRA will file a solicitation/recommendation statement with respect to the tender offer. Investors and stockholders of CSRA are strongly advised to read the tender offer statement (including the related exhibits) and the solicitation/recommendation statement, as they may be amended from time to time, when they become available, because they will contain important information that stockholders should consider before making any decision regarding tendering their shares. The tender offer statement (including the related exhibits) and the solicitation/recommendation statement will be available at no charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. In addition, the tender offer statement and other documents that Merger Sub files with the SEC will be made available to all stockholders of CSRA free of charge at www.gd.com. The solicitation/recommendation statement and the other documents filed by CSRA with the SEC will be made available to all stockholders of CSRA free of charge at www.csra.com. Additional Information about the Merger and Where to Find It In connection with the potential one-step merger of Merger Sub with and into CSRA without the prior consummation of the Offer (the “One Step Merger”), CSRA will file a proxy statement with the SEC. Additionally, CSRA will file other relevant materials with the SEC in connection with the proposed acquisition of CSRA by General Dynamics and Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Investors and stockholders of CSRA are strongly advised to read the proxy statement and the other relevant materials, as they may be amended from time to time, when they become available, because they will contain important information about the One Step Merger and the parties to the One Step Merger, before making any voting or investment decision with respect to the One Step Merger. The proxy statement will be available at no charge on the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov. The proxy statement and other documents filed by CSRA with the SEC will be made available to all stockholders of CSRA free of charge at www.csra.com.
