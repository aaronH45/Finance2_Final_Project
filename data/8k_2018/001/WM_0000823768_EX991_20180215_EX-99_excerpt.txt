  KEY HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND THE FULL YEAR 2017           

          Revenue Growth           

      ·   In the fourth quarter, overall revenue increased by 5.5%, or $192 million, from the same period in the prior year. The revenue growth was driven by strong yield and volume growth in the Company’s collection and disposal business, which contributed $172 million of the increase. For the full year 2017, overall revenue increased by 6.4%, or $876 million. Yield and volume growth in the Company’s collection and disposal business increased revenue by $536 million. Though revenue from the Company’s recycling yield and volume declined by $25 million on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2017, full-year recycling yield and volume contributed $231 million of revenue growth.

Fish concluded, “2017 was a very successful year for Waste Management, and we expect that 2018 will be just as successful. With the anticipated reduction in our cash taxes, we are proactively investing in our front-line employees, technology, and capital equipment to grow our business and improve customer service. Our employees are hard at work on executing our 2018 plans, which should position us to continue to grow our earnings and cash flow in 2018 and beyond.” 

(a) For purposes of this press release, all references to “Net income” refer to the financial statement line items “Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.” 

(b) This press release contains a discussion of non-GAAP measures, as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company reports its financial results in compliance with GAAP, but believes that also discussing non-GAAP measures provides investors with (i) additional, meaningful comparisons of current results to prior periods’ results by excluding items that the Company does not believe reflect its fundamental business performance and are not representative or indicative of its results of operations and (ii) financial measures the Company uses in the management of its business. Accordingly, earnings per diluted share, income from operations, and operating EBITDA have been presented in certain instances excluding items identified in the reconciliations provided. The Company defines operating EBITDA as income from operations before depreciation and amortization; this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

The Company’s projected full year 2018 earnings per diluted share and operating EBITDA are anticipated to be adjusted to exclude the effects of events or circumstances in 2018 that are not representative or indicative of the Company’s results of operations. Projected GAAP earnings per diluted share and operating EBITDA for the full year would require information about the projected impact of future excluded items, including items that are not currently determinable, but may be significant, such as asset impairments and one-time items, charges, gains or losses from divestitures or litigation, or other items. Due to the uncertainty of the likelihood, amount and timing of any such items, the Company does not have information available to provide a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted projected full year earnings per diluted share, or adjusted projected operating EBITDA, to the comparable GAAP measure. 

The Company also discusses free cash flow and provides a projection of free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure. The Company discusses free cash flow because the Company believes that it is indicative of its ability to pay its quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay its debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace “Net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure. However, the Company believes free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how the Company views its liquidity. Nevertheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested); this definition may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

The quantitative reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used herein to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the accompanying schedules, with the exception of projected earnings per diluted share and projected operating EBITDA. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, and investors are urged to take into account GAAP measures as well as non-GAAP measures in evaluating the Company. 

(c) Core price is a performance metric used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of our pricing strategies; it is not derived from our financial statements and may not be comparable to measures presented by other companies. Core price is based on certain historical assumptions, which may differ from actual results, to allow for comparability between reporting periods and to reveal trends in results over time. 

The Company will host a conference call at 10:00 AM (Eastern) today to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. Information contained within this press release will be referenced and should be considered in conjunction with the call. 

The conference call will be webcast live from the Investor Relations section of Waste Management’s website www.wm.com. To access the conference call by telephone, please
