 Item 8.01Other Events. 

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21% and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. 

Morgan Stanley (the “Company”) estimates, based on currently available information, that net income for the quarter ending December 31, 2017, will include an aggregate net discrete tax provision of approximately $1.25 billion, comprised of an approximate $1.4 billion net discrete tax provision as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, primarily from the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower enacted corporate tax rate, partially offset by an approximate $160 million net discrete tax benefit, primarily associated with the remeasurement of reserves and related interest relating to the status of multi-year Internal Revenue Service tax examinations. 

The estimated enactment discrete tax provision incorporates assumptions made based upon the Company’s current interpretation of the Tax Act, and may change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance and as the interpretation of the Tax Act evolves over time.
