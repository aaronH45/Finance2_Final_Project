Item 8.01 Other Events  

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the “Registrant,” the “firm” or “we”) today announced that the Compensation Committee of the firm’s Board of Directors has determined Mr. Lloyd C. Blankfein’s total annual compensation for 2017. Mr. Blankfein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, received $24,000,000 in 2017 compensation, which compares to 2016 total annual compensation of $22,000,000. Mr. Blankfein’s 2017 compensation consists of an annual base salary of $2,000,000, which remains unchanged from last year, and annual variable compensation of $22,000,000. Consistent with last year, 80% of this annual variable compensation (i.e., $17,600,000) was granted in the form of performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”), with the remainder granted in the form of cash. The PSUs tie 100% of Mr. Blankfein’s annual equity-based compensation to ongoing performance metrics; these metrics remain unchanged from the PSUs granted for 2016 compensation.  

In determining Mr. Blankfein’s compensation, the Compensation Committee considered several factors, including that during 2017, our firm delivered higher revenue and stronger pre-tax profits despite a challenging environment for our market-making businesses. In addition, we continued to demonstrate strength across many of our franchise businesses and maintained a solid financial position with respect to capital and liquidity. Over the course of the year, we announced a $5 billion growth plan that will continue to position the firm strategically for growth in the future.  

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Registrant reported net revenues of $32.07 billion, diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”) of $9.01 and return on average common shareholders’ equity (“ROE”) of 4.9%. Excluding the impact of the Registrant’s income tax expense related to U.S. Tax Legislation1, for 2017, the Registrant’s EPS was $19.76 and its ROE was 10.8%.  

 1  “U.S. Tax Legislation” refers to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017. For notes on non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation with the corresponding GAAP figures, see Exhibit 99.1 to the Registrant’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 17, 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, containing the Registrant’s earnings press release for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
