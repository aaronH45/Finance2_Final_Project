Item 8.01 Other Events 

On February 23, 2018, the North Carolina Utilities Commission (the “NCUC”) issued an order (the “Order”) approving, without modification, the Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement dated November 22, 2017, between Duke Energy Progress, LLC (“DEP”) and the Public Staff - North Carolina Utilities Commission (the “Public Staff”) (the “Settlement”) which settled certain issues in the rate case proceeding which DEP filed on June 1, 2017, with the NCUC. The Settlement includes, among other things, a return on equity of 9.9% based upon a capital structure of 52% equity and 48% debt. 

The Order also resolves the outstanding items in the rate case proceeding, including the recovery of deferred storm costs and the recovery of deferred coal ash costs which were deemed to be reasonable and prudent, known and measureable and used and useful in the provision of service to customers. Specifically, the Order: 

· Disallows $9.5 million of deferred coal ash basin costs related to ash hauling at DEP’s Asheville Plant; 

· Approves recovery of remaining $232 million deferred costs over a 5 year period with a return at DEP’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”); 

· Assesses a $30 million management penalty by reducing the annual recovery of the deferred costs by $6 million per year for five years; and 

· Denies DEP’s request for recovery of the estimated ongoing annual coal ash costs of $129 million. Instead, these costs will be deferred with a return at DEP’s WACC, to be considered for recovery in the next rate case. 

With respect to deferred storm costs, the Order reduces DEP’s recovery from its request of $80 million to $51 million and directs that a five-year amortization of these costs should begin in October 2016 rather than when rates are effective. DEP is permitted a full WACC return during the remaining amortization period. 

The preliminary estimate for rate base for DEP’s retail customers in North Carolina addressed in the rate case is approximately $8.148 billion. New rates will become effective one day after the Commission approves the filing by DEP recalculating the revenue requirements based on the findings and conclusions in the Order, currently estimated by mid-March. 

As a result of the Order, Duke Energy will take an estimated pre-tax charge of approximately $100 million in the first quarter of 2018, primarily related to the coal ash basin disallowance and management penalty and deferred storm cost adjustments, which will be excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share and treated as a special item. 

An overview providing additional detail on the Order is attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.
