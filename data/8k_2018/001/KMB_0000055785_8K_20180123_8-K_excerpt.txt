Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

On January 22, 2018, the Corporation approved a global restructuring program to reduce its structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying the Corporation’s manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. The Corporation expects to close or sell approximately 10 manufacturing facilities and to exit or divest some lower-margin businesses that generate approximately 1 percent of the Corporation’s net sales. The sales are concentrated in the Corporation’s consumer tissue business segment. The restructuring is expected to impact all business segments and organizations in all major geographies. Workforce reductions are expected to be in the range of 5,000 to 5,500. Certain actions under the restructuring are being finalized for implementation. 

The restructuring actions will commence in the first quarter of 2018 and are expected to be completed by December 31, 2020. The restructuring is expected to result in cumulative charges of approximately $1.7 to $1.9 billion pre-tax ($1.35 to $1.5 billion after tax) over that period. Cash costs are expected to be $900 million to $1 billion, primarily related to workforce reductions. Non-cash charges are primarily related to incremental depreciation and asset write-offs. Additionally, the Corporation expects to spend $600 to $700 million in incremental capital to implement the restructuring. Restructuring charges in 2018 are expected to be $1.2 to $1.35 billion pre-tax ($950 million to $1.05 billion after tax).
