FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 2 This presentation contains statements and depictions that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, including, without limitation, with respect to future goals and prospects, business strategies, revenues, earnings, cash flow, taxes, adjusted EBITDA, production, supply, dividend levels, share repurchases, business priorities, performance, cost reductions and eliminations, operational excellence initiatives and goals, asset and portfolio review, quantitative and qualitative demand drivers and levels for our products, competition and supply factors, pricing, margins, growth, housing markets, capital structure, financial ratios, credit ratings, capital expenditure priorities, cash position, debt levels, harvests, and export markets, including future Canadian share of U.S. lumber markets. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements may be identified by our use of certain words in such statements, including without limitation words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “continued,” “could,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “outlook,” “goal,” “will,” “plan,” “expect,” “target,” “would” and similar words and terms and phrases using such terms and words, while depictions that constitute forward-looking statements may be identified by graphs, charts or other illustrations indicating expected or predicted occurrences of events, conditions, performance or achievements at a future date or during future time periods. We may refer to assumptions, goals or targets, or we may reference expected performance through, or events to occur by or at, a future date, and such references may also constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions concerning future events, and are inherently subject to uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment that are difficult to predict and often beyond the company’s control. These and other factors could cause one or more of our expectations to be unmet, one or more of our assumptions to be materially inaccurate or actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Such factors include, without limitation: our ability to successfully execute our performance plans, including cost reductions and other operational excellence initiatives; the effect of general economic conditions, including employment rates, housing starts, interest rate levels, availability of financing for home mortgages and the strength of the U.S. dollar; market demand for our products, including demand for our timberland properties with higher and better uses, which in turn is related to the strength of various U.S. business segments and U.S. and international economic conditions; domestic and foreign competition; raw material prices; energy prices; the effect of weather; the risk of loss from fires, floods, windstorms, hurricanes, pest infestation and other natural disasters; transportation availability and costs; federal tax policies; the effect of forestry, land use, environmental and other governmental regulations; legal proceedings; performance of pension fund investments and related derivatives; the effect of timing of retirements and changes in market price of our common stock on charges for share-based compensation; changes in accounting principles; and other factors described in filings we make from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation the risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. There is no guarantee that any of the anticipated events or results articulated in this presentation will occur or, if they occur, what effect they will have on the company’s results of operations or financial condition. The forward-looking statements contained herein apply only as of the date of this presentation and we do not undertake any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Nothing on our website is intended to be included or incorporated by reference into, or made a part of, this presentation. Also included in this presentation are certain non-GAAP financial measures, which management believes complement the financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Management believes such non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly named or captioned non-GAAP financial measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in how such measures are calculated. A reconciliation of each presented non-GAAP measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in the appendices to this presentation.
