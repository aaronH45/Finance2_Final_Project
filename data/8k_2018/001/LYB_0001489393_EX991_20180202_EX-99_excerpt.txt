LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE: LYB) today announced earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2017 of $1.9 billion, or $4.80 per share. Fourth quarter 2017 EBITDA was $1.7 billion. The quarter included an $819 million one-time, non-cash benefit from U.S. tax reform that reduced net deferred tax liabilities and increased earnings by $2.07 per share. Full year 2017 income from continuing operations was $4.9 billion, or $12.28 per share, and EBITDA was $7.1 billion. During the first quarter, the company refinanced $1 billion in bonds at an after-tax cost of $106 million. The full year was positively impacted by an after-tax gain of $103 million in September on the sale of our interest in the Geosel pipeline and storage system in France and the fourth quarter one-time, non-cash benefit of $819 million from the reduction of net deferred tax liabilities. Combined, the net effect of the bond refinancing, Geosel gain and tax reform benefit positively impacted full year 2017 earnings by $2.05 per share.  

“In 2017 we demonstrated the strength of our earnings performance under dynamic market conditions. Against a backdrop of substantial new capacity in our industry, LyondellBasell increased volumes, improved EBITDA and raised earnings. The complementary performance of our two global Olefins and Polyolefins segments combined with the relative stability of our Intermediates and Derivatives business portfolio provided a resilient platform for profitability during 2017. Outstanding performance by our Olefins and Polyolefins — Europe, Asia and International segment provided a fourth consecutive year of record EBITDA. In 2017, global operating rates remained strong due to delays in new capacity, a volume shortfall from Hurricane Harvey and an improving Chinese market. LyondellBasell captured market opportunities by operating our plants safely and reliably. We advanced our growth program by starting up a new polypropylene compounding plant in China, entering a premium polymer recycling joint venture with SUEZ, breaking ground on our new Hyperzone HDPE plant in La Porte, Texas and reaching a final investment decision for the world’s largest PO/TBA plant,” said Bob Patel, LyondellBasell chief executive officer.  

OUTLOOK  

“Over the past several months, strong global demand and delays in capacity additions across our industry have improved the outlook for 2018. We look forward to realizing the benefits of strong operating rates across our global portfolio of assets and continuing the upward trajectory in reliability and profitability for the Houston refinery. Over the coming years, LyondellBasell will continue to advance our growth by increasing the pace of organic business investments while diligently pursuing value-adding inorganic opportunities,” Patel said.

Table 2 - O&P–Americas Financial Overview  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Three months ended December 31, 2017 versus three months ended September 30, 2017 – EBITDA increased $168 million versus the third quarter 2017. Fourth quarter results were impacted by a last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory charge of $22 million. Compared to the prior period, olefins results increased approximately $160 million. This increase was driven by a margin improvement of approximately 5 cents per pound due to higher ethylene prices, higher co-product contribution and lower feedstock costs. Volumes improved in the fourth quarter as plants returned to normal operation post Hurricane Harvey. Combined polyolefins results increased by approximately $40 million primarily due to an improvement in the polyethylene price spread over ethylene of approximately 2 cents per pound.  

Three months ended December 31, 2017 versus three months ended December 31, 2016 – EBITDA increased $221 million versus the fourth quarter 2016, which included a $23 million pension settlement. Olefins results increased approximately $100 million versus the fourth quarter 2016. Ethylene margins improved approximately 5 cents per pound primarily due to improved co-product pricing. Combined polyolefins results increased approximately $75 million. Polyethylene spreads improved approximately 7 cents per pound as polyethylene price increases outpaced ethylene price increases.  

Full year ended December 31, 2017 versus full year ended December 31, 2016 – EBITDA increased $105 million versus 2016, which included a $57 million gain on the sale of the Petroken polypropylene business and a $23 million pension settlement. 2017 results include a $31 million gain on the sale of property in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Olefins results increased by approximately $170 million from the prior year. Production was approximately 17 percent higher primarily due to 2016 scheduled plant maintenance and the expansion at Corpus Christi. Ethylene margins improved slightly with tighter market conditions. Combined polyolefins results decreased approximately $70 million versus the prior year. Polypropylene spreads over propylene declined approximately 5 cents per pound compared to high levels seen in 2016. This was partially offset by polyethylene spreads over ethylene increasing approximately 2 cents per pound. Joint venture equity income decreased by $17 million versus the prior year.

Fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by a pension settlement charge of $20 million and a LIFO inventory charge of $20 million. Compared to the prior period, olefins results decreased approximately $100 million. Ethylene margins declined approximately 6 cents per pound primarily due to increased feedstock costs. Volume declined primarily due to unplanned maintenance in October 2017 at our Wesseling, Germany cracker. Combined polyolefins results declined by approximately $75 million due to margin declines in polyolefins and seasonal sales volume declines for both polyethylene and polypropylene.  

Three months ended December 31, 2017 versus three months ended December 31, 2016 – EBITDA decreased by $42 million versus the fourth quarter 2016. The fourth quarter 2017 was negatively impacted by an additional $12 million of pension settlement charges relative to 2016. Compared to the prior period, olefins results were relatively unchanged. Combined polyolefins results declined by approximately $25 million primarily due to a decrease in polyethylene margin.  

Full year ended December 31, 2017 versus full year ended December 31, 2016 – The segment achieved record EBITDA for 2017. EBITDA increased $215 million versus 2016, which included gains totaling $32 million from the sale of the Petroken polypropylene business, restructuring of Asian polypropylene joint ventures and the sale of idled Australian polypropylene assets. 2017 results included a benefit of $108 million from the gain on the sale of our interest in Geosel which was partially offset by pension charges that were $12 million higher than 2016. Olefins results increased by approximately $190 million. This increase was driven by margins which improved primarily due to an ethylene price increase of approximately 6 cents per pound. Volumes improved 4% in the absence of planned maintenance which occurred at two of the European crackers in 2016. Combined polyolefins results decreased approximately $50 million compared to the prior year driven by a polyethylene spread decline of approximately 3 cents per pound which was partially offset by an increase in polyolefin sales volumes. Joint venture equity income decreased by $31 million.

Volumes increased approximately 5% with the absence of Hurricane Harvey impacts and margins improved due to market tightness. Intermediate chemicals results were relatively unchanged from the third quarter. Oxyfuels and related products results were relatively unchanged as seasonal margin declines were offset by volume improvements with the absence of hurricane losses during the third quarter.  

Three months ended December 31, 2017 versus three months ended December 31, 2016 – EBITDA increased $104 million versus the fourth quarter 2016, which included a $16 million pension settlement. Results for PO and derivatives and intermediate chemicals improved by approximately $120 million. PO and derivatives volumes and margins improved as well as intermediate chemicals margins. The gains in the PO and derivatives and intermediate chemicals businesses were offset by a net charge of approximately $35 million related to precious metal catalysts.

Full year ended December 31, 2017 versus full year ended December 31, 2016 – EBITDA increased $157 million versus 2016, which included a $16 million pension settlement. EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion for 2017 returned to the historical levels typically seen for the business.

The gains in the PO and derivatives and intermediate chemicals businesses were offset by approximately $50 million of higher charges related to precious metal catalysts. Oxyfuels and related products results declined by approximately $60 million. Volumes were lower due to planned maintenance in 2017 and margins were reduced primarily due to higher butane pricing.
