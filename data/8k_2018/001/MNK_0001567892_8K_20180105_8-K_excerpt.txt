Introductory Note

As previously announced in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 26, 2017, on December 23, 2017, Mallinckrodt plc (“Mallinckrodt”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Sun Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Mallinckrodt (“Purchaser”), and Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Sucampo”), pursuant to which Purchaser will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, commence a tender offer (the “Offer”) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Sucampo (the “Sucampo Shares”) at a purchase price of $18.00 per Sucampo Share in cash, subject to any required withholding of taxes and without interest, and, following the completion of the Offer merge with and into Sucampo (the “Merger”), with Sucampo surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Mallinckrodt. 

Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

On December 29, 2017, Mallinckrodt International Finance S.A. (“MIFSA”), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Mallinckrodt, borrowed $900,000,000 as a revolving loan (the “Revolving Loan”) under the revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) established pursuant to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of March 19, 2014 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Credit Agreement”), among Mallinckrodt, MIFSA, Mallinckrodt CB LLC, the lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Loan matures on February 28, 2022, and is prepayable prior to such date, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty at the election of MIFSA. After giving effect to the borrowing of the Revolving Loan, there is no remaining availability under the Revolving Credit Facility.

It is contemplated that some or all of the proceeds from the Revolving Loan will be used to finance, in part, the consideration payable in the Offer and the Merger, which are expected to be completed in the first calendar quarter of 2018.
