GAAP net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $994.2 million, up 19.2% from GAAP net sales of $834.4 million in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. GAAP net loss from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $(251.1) million, or $(1.07) per diluted share, down from GAAP net income from continuing operations of $107.3 million, or 46 cents per diluted share, in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. The prior year's GAAP net income results were significantly adversely impacted by purchase accounting adjustments associated with our Atmel acquisition. The current year's GAAP net income results were significantly adversely impacted by one-time tax adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

Non-GAAP net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $994.2 million, up 12.8% from non-GAAP net sales of $881.2 million in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $341.2 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, up 38.4% from non-GAAP net income of $246.5 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of discontinued operations, share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), revenue recognition changes related to Atmel distributors resulting from changes to business practices with those distributors, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, a loss on the settlement of our convertible debentures, an impairment on an available-for-sale investment, the related income tax implications of these items, tax adjustments in accordance with ASC 740-270 and non-recurring tax events, including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our year-to-date non-GAAP results include all of the aforementioned adjustments plus the effect of a manufacturing excursion issue with one of our suppliers, preclusion of revenue recognition under GAAP for inventory in the distribution channel on the acquisition dates of our acquisitions, a gain on an equity method investment, and the related income tax implications of these items. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.

Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a record quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 36.30 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on March 6, 2018 to stockholders of record on February 21, 2018.

"Our December 2017 quarter financial results were better than the midpoint of our guidance," said Steve Sanghi, Chief Executive Officer. "Our net sales were slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Our gross margin was at the high end of our guidance range, our operating expenses as a percentage of sales were below the low end of our guidance range, and our non-GAAP operating profit was a record at 39.4% of sales."

Mr. Sanghi added, "Our Microchip 2.0 growth initiative is rapidly moving forward. Microchip 2.0 combines the product, technology, system and employee strengths of Microchip and its previous acquisitions and allows us to

provide Total System Solutions to our customers by selling multiple solutions into the circuit boards that drive their end applications."

"Our Microcontroller business performed well in the December 2017 quarter and revenue was up 18.9% on a year-over-year basis," said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Operating Officer. "Our Microcontroller portfolio and roadmap have never been stronger and we are seeing continued growth in our design-in funnel which we expect will drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time."

Mr. Moorthy added, "Our Licensing business set a new revenue record in the December quarter and was up 6.8% sequentially and 15.5% year over year. We are seeing the benefits in our results of having licensed several foundries and independent device makers for several years on multiple process technology nodes as the licensed processes ramp volume and generate royalty revenue for many years to come."

Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, "Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was a record $365 million. As of December 31, 2017, the cash and total investment position on our balance sheet was $1.985 billion."

Mr. Bjornholt added, "We expect the taxes to be paid as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to be approximately $300 million. These taxes will be paid over a time period of eight years."

Commenting on the business environment, Mr. Sanghi added, "As we have indicated before, our seasonality for any given quarter will change as we integrate acquisitions and end up with a new blended seasonality. The seasonality of the Atmel business is driven by a larger percentage of consumer oriented business which tends to have a sharper decline in the March quarter. Using the March quarter historical seasonality of Atmel when it was a stand-alone company, and of Microchip prior to the Atmel acquisition, the blended average of Microchip’s and Atmel’s seasonality is about a 1% sequential revenue decline."

Mr. Sanghi concluded, "Based on our view of the current quarter’s seasonality, we expect total net sales to be up 1% to down 3%, sequentially, which at the midpoint would represent 9% growth year-over-year."

Microchip's Highlights for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017:

•Expanded our collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS), including support for Amazon FreeRTOS, AWS Greengrass and AWS IoT, providing a robust product portfolio and toolchain to support the creation of connected designs with enhanced security from the node to the cloud.

2 See Footnote 2 under the "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section of this release.

3 Earnings per share has been calculated based on the diluted shares outstanding of Microchip on a consolidated basis.

•Microchip's inventory days in the March 2018 quarter are expected to be in the range of our longer-term target model of 115 to 120 days of inventory. Our actual inventory level will depend on the inventory that our distributors decide to hold to support their customers, overall demand for our products and our production levels.

•Capital expenditures for the quarter ending March 31, 2018 are expected to be between $50 million and $60 million. Capital expenditures for all of fiscal year 2018 are expected to be between $200 million and $210 million. We are continuing to invest in the equipment needed to support the growth of our production capabilities for fast growing new products and technologies.

1 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Our non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of discontinued operations, share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions), revenue recognition changes related to Atmel distributors resulting from changes to business practices with those distributors, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, a loss on the settlement of our convertible debentures, an impairment on an available-for-sale investment, the related income tax implications of these items, tax adjustments in accordance with ASC 740-270 and non-recurring tax events including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Our year-to-date non-GAAP results include all of the aforementioned adjustments plus the effect of a manufacturing excursion issue with one of our suppliers, preclusion of revenue recognition under GAAP for inventory in the distribution channel

on the acquisition dates of our acquisitions, a gain on an equity method investment, and the related income tax implications of these items.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. Our other non-GAAP adjustments are either non-cash expenses, unusual or infrequent items or other expenses related to transactions. Management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

We are using non-GAAP net sales, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit percentage, non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other expense, net, non-GAAP income tax rate, non-GAAP net income from continuing operations, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations which exclude the items noted above, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.

Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of our business. Specifically, we do not consider such items when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Our determination of the above non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

2 Generally, gross margin fluctuates over time, driven primarily by the mix of microcontrollers, mixed-signal products, analog products and memory products sold and licensing revenue; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; costs of wafers from foundries; inventory reserves; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to net sales and profit levels.

3 Diluted Common Shares Outstanding can vary for, among other things, the trading price of our common stock, the exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the potential for incremental dilutive shares from our convertible debentures (additional information regarding our share count is available in the investor relations section of our website under the heading "Supplemental Financial Information"), and repurchases or issuances of shares of our common stock. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table above assumes an average Microchip stock price in the March 2018 quarter between $90 and $100 per share (however, we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period and we cannot estimate what our stock option exercise activity will be during the quarter).
