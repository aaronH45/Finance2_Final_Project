Section 5 – CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT 

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers 

On January 30, 2018, stockholders of Hormel Foods Corporation (the Company) approved the Hormel Foods Corporation 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan (the Plan). 

The purpose of the Plan is to promote the interests of the Company and its stockholders by aiding the Company in attracting and retaining employees, officers, nonemployee directors, consultants and advisors capable of assuring the future success of the Company, to offer such persons incentives to put forth maximum efforts for the success of the Company’s business, to afford such persons an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company by rewarding them for making major contributions to the success of the Company and to thereby promote the Company’s long-term business success. 

The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which has the authority to determine the persons to whom awards will be granted, the timing of awards, the type and number of shares covered by each award, the terms, conditions, performance criteria and restrictions of the awards as well as the manner in which awards are paid and settled. Eligible participants include any employees, consultants and advisors of the Company or any subsidiary, as well as nonemployee directors of the Company. Awards under the Plan may be in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock units, other stock-based awards, and cash incentive awards. 

The Plan was filed in Appendix A to the Proxy Statement on December 20, 2017. 

The compensation committee adopted Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 as agreements under the Plan.
