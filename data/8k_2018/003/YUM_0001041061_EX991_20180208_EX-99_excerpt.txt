Louisville, KY (February 8, 2018) - Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM) today reported results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. Fourth-quarter GAAP EPS was $1.26, an increase of 53%.

GREG CREED & DAVID GIBBS COMMENTS

Greg Creed, CEO, said “As we close the first full year of our transformation, I am very proud of the progress we are making towards becoming a more focused, more franchised and more efficient company that generates more growth. During 2017, system sales grew a healthy 5% excluding the impact of lapping the 53rd week in 2016, with same-store sales growth of 2% and net new unit growth of 3%. As we move forward into 2018, we are particularly excited about our investment in ‘Easy’ with our new partnership with Grubhub. We are confident that the continued focus on our four key growth drivers supports our vision for a ‘World with More Yum!’ and maximizes the creation of value for all Yum! stakeholders.”

David Gibbs, President and CFO, continued “The fourth quarter was a solid ending to a year where Yum! Brands met or exceeded each component of our full-year guidance. Despite headwinds from refranchising dilution and lapping a 53rd week, we delivered full-year core operating profit growth of 7%. We are on track with our strategic transformation to accelerate growth and made significant progress towards achieving these objectives in 2017. We look forward to updating you as we continue on our journey to build the world’s most loved, trusted and fastest-growing restaurant brands.”

SUMMARY FINANCIAL TABLE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results within this release for further detail of Special Items.

All comparisons are versus the same period a year ago. Effective January 2017, we removed the reporting lags from our international subsidiary fiscal calendars. To accommodate these changes, Yum! Brands now reports on a monthly calendar basis though certain subsidiaries, including our U.S. subsidiaries, continue to be included in our consolidated results on a periodic basis with 3, 3, 3 & 4 four-week periods in each quarter, respectively. Prior year figures in this earnings release have been restated to present comparable results. An 8-K was filed on April 13, 2017 with restated quarterly and full-year 2016 results.

System sales growth figures exclude foreign currency translation ("F/X") and core operating profit growth figures exclude F/X and Special Items. Special Items are not allocated to any segment and therefore only impact worldwide GAAP results. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results within this release for further details. 

Unless otherwise noted, all results include the impact of lapping the 53rd week in 2016.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1Pizza Hut U.K. and Pizza Hut Australia, both of which are International Developed Markets, transitioned from a periodic weekly calendar to a monthly calendar beginning in the first quarter of 2017. As a result, system sales growth for both markets was negatively impacted in the fourth quarter due to Q4 2017 results having approximately 13 weeks compared to Q4 2016 results having 17 weeks, including a 53rd week. There was not a significant impact from this calendar change on full-year system sales growth for either market.

OTHER ITEMS

●

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”) that was enacted on December 22nd required that earnings repatriated from our foreign entities with a November 30 year-end for tax purposes be included in the Deemed Repatriation Tax on foreign earnings that was included in the Tax Act. Our fourth quarter and full year effective tax rates excluding Special Items were lower than anticipated because they did not include tax on those earnings repatriated after November 30. Instead, that tax was included in the one-time Special Items charge of $434 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter related to the Tax Act.

●Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our Restricted Group capital structure will be provided at the time of the filing of the Form 10-K.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results

(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)

(unaudited)

In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations excluding Special Items, our Effective Tax Rate excluding Special Items, System sales, System sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation ("FX"), System sales excluding the impact of FX and 53rd week, Core Operating Profit and Core Operating Profit excluding 53rd week. Core Operating Profit excludes Special Items and FX and we use Core Operating Profit for the purposes of evaluating performance internally. We provide Core Operating Profit and System sales excluding 53rd week to further enhance the comparability with the lapping of the 53rd week that was part of our fiscal calendar in 2016. Special Items are not included in any of our Division segment results, and we believe the elimination of FX provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations. The Special Items are described in (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) in the accompanying notes. 

These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations excluding Special Items, our Effective Tax Rate excluding Special Items, Core Operating Profit and Core Operating Profit excluding 53rd week provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items in the quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature. System sales and System sales growth include the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including company-owned and franchise restaurants that operate our Concepts. Sales of franchise restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise and license fees for the Company at a rate of 3% to 6% of sales. Franchise restaurant sales are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise and license fees are included in the Company’s revenues. We believe System sales and System sales growth are useful to investors as significant indicators of the overall strength of our business as they incorporate all of our revenue drivers, Company and franchise same-store sales as well as net unit growth.

Notes to the Consolidated Summary of Results, Consolidated Balance Sheets

and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

(amounts in millions)

(unaudited)

(a)Amounts presented as of and for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are preliminary.

(b)In connection with our previously announced plans to have at least 98% franchise restaurant ownership by the end of 2018, we recorded net refranchising gains during the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 of $752 million and $88 million, respectively, that have been reflected as Special Items. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded net refranchising gains of $1.1 billion and $163 million, respectively, that have been reflected as Special Items.

The fourth quarter 2017 net refranchising gains related primarily to refranchising KFC restaurants in Thailand, Australia and the UK, and the refranchising of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in the U.S. The fourth quarter 2016 net refranchising gains related primarily to refranchising Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. and KFC restaurants in Thailand and Germany.

(c)In the fourth quarter of 2016, we announced our plan to transform our business. Major features of the Company's strategic transformation plans involve being more focused on development of our three brands, increasing our franchise ownership and creating a leaner, more efficient cost structure (“YUM’s Strategic Transformation Initiatives”). During the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized Special Item charges of $8 million and $33 million, respectively, related to these initiatives. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized Special Item charges of $23 million and $67 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2017, these costs related primarily to contract termination costs that were recorded within G&A. During the remainder of 2017 and 2016, these costs related primarily to severance, a 2016 voluntary retirement program offered to certain U.S. employees and relocation costs that were recorded within G&A.

(d)On May 1, 2017, we reached an agreement with our Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees that will improve brand marketing alignment, accelerate enhancements in operations and technology and includes a permanent commitment to incremental advertising contributions by franchisees beginning in 2018. During the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded Special Item charges of $11 million and $31 million, respectively, for these investments. The majority of these amounts were recorded as Franchise and license expenses or G&A.

(e)During the first quarter of 2015, we reached an agreement with our KFC U.S. franchisees that gave us brand marketing control as well as an accelerated path to improved assets and customer experience. In connection with this agreement, we recognized Special Item charges of $5 million and $9 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we recognized Special Item charges of $17 million and $26 million, respectively. The majority of these costs were recorded as Franchise and license expenses. 

(f)In connection with the separation of Yum China, we modified certain share-based compensation awards held as part of our Executive Income Deferral Plan in YUM stock to provide one Yum China share-based award for each outstanding YUM share-based award. These Yum China awards may now be settled in cash, as opposed to stock, which requires recognition of the fair value of these awards each quarter within G&A in our Consolidated Income Statement. During the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded non-cash Special Item charges of less than $1 million and $18 million, respectively, related to these awards. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded non-cash Special Item charges of $30 million related to these awards.

(g)We recorded a non-cash charge of $22 million related to the adjustment of certain historical deferred vested liability balances in our qualified U.S. plan during the first quarter of 2017. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company allowed certain former employees with deferred vested balances in the YUM Retirement Plan an opportunity to voluntarily elect an early payout of their pension benefits. As a result of payments made of $225 million related to this program exceeding the sum of service and interest costs within the Plan, we recorded a Special Items settlement charge of $24 million in G&A during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. In connection with this program, we also incurred an additional Special Items settlement charge of $1 million during the third quarter of 2017. These charges are recorded in Other pension (income) expense.

18

(h)During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a one-time charge of $434 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”) as enacted by the United States government on December 22, 2017. This charge included a deemed repatriation tax expense of $170 million on undistributed foreign earnings, $75 million of expense associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets to the new 21% U.S. corporate tax rate and $189 million of valuation allowances established against foreign tax credit carryforwards which we no longer expect to utilize under the territorial system that is part of the Tax Act. This one-time charge is based upon our current estimates and interpretations of the Tax Act, and could be subject to further change as additional guidance and accounting interpretation is issued.
