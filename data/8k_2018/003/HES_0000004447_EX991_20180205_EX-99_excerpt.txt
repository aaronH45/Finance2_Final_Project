 Exhibit 99.1 

HESS CORPORATION 

HESS REPORTS ESTIMATED RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017 

Key Highlights: 

•  

A sixth oil discovery on the Stabroek block, offshore Guyana (Hess 30 percent), was announced at the Ranger-1 exploration well located approximately 60 miles to the northwest of the Liza Field 

•  

Total recoverable resources estimate from five previous Guyana discoveries increased to more than 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) from previous range of 2.5 billion to 2.8 billion boe 

•  

The Liza Phase 1 development on the Stabroek Block is on plan with first production expected in March 2020; start up of the Liza Phase 2 development is expected by mid 2022 

•  

The Corporation successfully completed the sale of its interests in Equatorial Guinea and Norway, bringing year-end 2017 cash and cash equivalents to $4.8 billion, which will fund Phases 1 and 2 of the Liza Field development, an increase from four rigs to six rigs in the Bakken, a $500 million stock repurchase program, and $500 million in debt retirement 

•  

Year-end proved reserves were 1,154 million boe, reserve replacement was 351 percent for 2017 at a finding and development (F&D) cost of $5.15 per boe 

Fourth Quarter Financial and Operating Highlights: 

•  

Primarily as a result of non-cash accounting charges, net loss was $2,677 million, or $8.57 per common share, compared with a net loss of $4,892 million, or $15.65 per common share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net after-tax special charges totaling $2,373 million were taken in the fourth quarter of 2017 that include a $1,700 million non-cash accounting charge to reduce the carrying value of Hess’ interests in the Stampede and Tubular Bells Fields in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook 

•  

Adjusted net loss was $304 million, or $1.01 per common share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $305 million, or $1.01 per common share, in the fourth quarter of last year; adjusted pre-tax loss was $104 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, down from $499 million in the year-ago quarter 

•  

Net production averaged 282,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), excluding Libya, reflecting unplanned downtime at the third-party operated Enchilada platform in the Gulf of Mexico which reduced fourth quarter production by approximately 17,000 boepd; Bakken production was 110,000 boepd 

•  

E&P capital and exploratory expenditures were $568 million in the quarter and $2,047 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 

•  

The Corporation returned $210 million to shareholders in the quarter through share repurchases and dividends, including the repurchase of 2.6 million common shares for approximately $120 million 

1 

2018 Guidance: 

•  

E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be $2.1 billion 

•  

Oil and gas production, excluding Libya and reflecting an estimated 15,000 boepd reduction due to the extended Enchilada platform shutdown, is forecast to be in the range of 245,000 to 255,000 boepd, compared to full year pro forma 2017 net production, excluding Libya and assets sold, of 242,000 boepd 

NEW YORK, February 5, 2018 — Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) today reported a net loss of $2,677 million, or $8.57 per common share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a net loss of $4,892 million, or $15.65 per common share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 results reflect net after-tax charges totaling $2,373 million, including a non-cash accounting charge of $1,700 million to reduce the carrying value of Hess’ interests in the Stampede and Tubular Bells Fields in the Gulf of Mexico, as a result of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook.  

On an adjusted basis, the Corporation reported an after-tax net loss of $304 million, or $1.01 per common share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with an adjusted net loss of $305 million, or $1.01 per common share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted pre-tax basis, the Corporation reported a loss of $104 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, down from $499 million in the year-ago quarter. The improved pre-tax adjusted results reflect higher realized crude oil selling prices and lower operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted results were adversely impacted by lower deferred tax benefits, primarily in the United States, compared to the prior-year quarter following a required change in deferred tax accounting.  

 “In the past year, our company successfully completed an ambitious asset sales program, replaced 351 percent of production at an attractive F&D cost of just over $5 per barrel, continued our extraordinary exploration success on the Stabroek Block in Guyana and sanctioned the Liza Phase 1 development with plans underway for the next two phases,” Chief Executive Officer John Hess said. “We enter 2018 well positioned to deliver a decade plus of capital efficient growth with increasing cash generation and returns to shareholders.”

After-tax income (loss) by major operating activity was as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Calculated as net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation less preferred stock dividends, divided by weighted average number of diluted shares. 

(b)  

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation excludes items affecting comparability summarized on page 7. A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation is provided on page 9. 

Exploration and Production: 

Exploration and Production (E&P) net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2,592 million, compared to a net loss of $3,949 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2017 net loss was $219 million, compared to a net loss of $256 million in the prior-year quarter. The Corporation’s average realized crude oil selling price, including the effect of hedging, was $55.44 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $45.97 per barrel in the year-ago quarter. The average realized natural gas liquids selling price in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $22.78 per barrel, versus $14.68 per barrel in the prior-year quarter, while the average realized natural gas selling price was $3.69 per mcf, compared with $3.24 per mcf in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Net production, excluding Libya, was 282,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 307,000 boepd in the prior-year quarter. Lower volumes were due to asset sales (26,000 boepd), unplanned downtime resulting from a fire at the third-party operated Enchilada platform in the Gulf of  

3 

Mexico (17,000 boepd) and natural decline and other net reductions (19,000 boepd), partially offset by higher production in the Bakken (15,000 boepd) and from North Malay Basin (22,000 boepd). 

Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, cash operating costs, which include operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes, and E&P general and administrative expenses, were $14.72 per boe in the fourth quarter, down 10 percent from $16.35 per boe in the prior-year quarter. Our fourth quarter 2017 cash operating costs per boe were adversely impacted by the Enchilada platform shutdown. The E&P effective tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability and Libya, was an expense of 21 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a benefit of 43 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Oil and Gas Reserve Estimates: 

Oil and gas proved reserves were 1,154 million boe at December 31, 2017, compared with 1,109 million boe at December 31, 2016. Proved reserve net additions and technical revisions added 397 million boe in 2017, primarily relating to the Bakken, Guyana and North Malay Basin in Malaysia. Asset sales reduced proved reserves by 239 million boe. The net additions and revisions of 397 million boe, which are subject to final review, replaced 351 percent of the Corporation’s 2017 production at a finding and development cost of $5.15 per boe, and resulted in a year-end 2017 reserve life of 10.2 years. 

U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: 

The Corporation expects no U.S. federal cash tax on the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the new law. The decrease in the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent resulted in a $1,475 million reduction to our U.S. net deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017, with a corresponding reduction in the previously established U.S. valuation allowance. Consequently, the remeasurement of deferred taxes using the newly enacted tax rate had no impact on net income or the balance sheet.  

Operational Highlights for the Fourth Quarter of 2017: 

Bakken (Onshore U.S.): Net production from the Bakken increased 16 percent to 110,000 boepd from 95,000 boepd in the year-ago quarter due to increased drilling activity in 2017. The Corporation operated an average of 4 rigs in the fourth quarter, drilling 27 wells and bringing 34 new wells online. 

4 

Gulf of Mexico (Offshore U.S.): Net production from the Gulf of Mexico was 40,000 boepd, compared to 61,000 boepd in the prior-year quarter primarily due to a fire at the third-party operated Enchilada platform. Prior to the shutdown in November, we were producing approximately 30,000 boepd from the Llano, Conger, Baldpate and Penn State fields through infrastructure associated with Enchilada. At the Stampede development (Hess operated - 25 percent), we completed subsea work, received regulatory approval for production operations, and continued drilling at the fourth production well and first water injection well. First production at Stampede commenced in January 2018. 

Guyana (Offshore): At the Stabroek Block (Hess - 30 percent), operated by Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, the Ranger-1 exploration well encountered approximately 230 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing carbonate reservoir and is the sixth significant oil discovery on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. Development activities associated with the Liza Phase 1 project are on schedule and first production is expected in March 2020. Start up of the Liza Phase 2 development is expected by mid 2022. Excluding Ranger, total discovered recoverable resources on the block are now estimated to be more than 3.2 billion boe. 

Midstream: 

The Midstream segment, comprised primarily of Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP), our 50/50 midstream joint venture, had net income of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net income of $2 million in the prior-year quarter. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, fourth quarter 2017 net income attributable to Hess Corporation was $20 million, compared to $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The lower fourth quarter 2017 adjusted results primarily reflect the recognition of an entire year of shortfall fees in the fourth quarter of 2016, as a result of changes in commercial agreements at the end of 2016, versus one quarter of shortfall fees recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017, and higher income allocated to noncontrolling interests following the Hess Midstream Partners LP initial public offering in April 2017. 

Corporate, Interest and Other: 

Net results were an after-tax loss of $105 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, down from $945 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2017 was an after-tax loss of $105 million compared to a loss of $72 million in the prior-year quarter. The fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate benefit of 14 percent was lower than the 36 percent benefit, excluding items affecting comparability, in 2016 due to the required change in deferred tax accounting.  

5 

Capital and Exploratory Expenditures: 

E&P capital and exploratory expenditures were $568 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $411 million in the prior-year quarter, which included increased drilling activity at the Bakken and Liza Phase 1 development activity following sanction in June 2017. Midstream capital expenditures were $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, down from $89 million in the year-ago quarter. 

Liquidity:  

Net cash provided by operating activities was $343 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $326 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $492 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $128 million in the year-ago quarter. Changes in working capital during the fourth quarter of 2017 was a net outflow of $149 million due to higher accounts receivable from increased crude oil prices, pension contributions, and abandonment expenditures. 

Excluding the Midstream segment, the Corporation had cash and cash equivalents of $4,491 million and total debt of $5,997 million at December 31, 2017. The Corporation’s debt to capitalization ratio was 36.1 percent at December 31, 2017 and 30.4 percent at December 31, 2016. 

The Midstream segment had cash and cash equivalents of $356 million and total debt of $980 million at December 31, 2017. In the fourth quarter, HIP issued $800 million of senior notes with a 5.625% coupon rate due in 2026, with the proceeds used to repay $480 million net under its existing credit facilities, to fund a distribution of $50 million to its sponsors and for general partnership purposes. These notes are non-recourse to Hess Corporation. In addition, HIP increased commitments under its undrawn revolving credit facility to $600 million, and extended its maturity to November 2022. 

2018 Cost Reduction Program: 

As part of our portfolio reshaping, we have begun implementation of an organization restructuring and cost reduction effort targeting annual savings of $150 million. In addition to direct headcount reductions as part of our assets sales, we eliminated approximately 400 employee and contractor positions in January and expect to record employee severance of $40 to $50 million in the first quarter. Since the end of 2014, total employee and contractor positions have been reduced by approximately 50 percent. In addition to the workforce reduction, we have identified further cost reductions in logistics, information technology, property, professional fees, and other operating costs  

6 

resulting from our portfolio reshaping. The benefit from this $150 million annualized cost reduction will begin to be realized over the second half of 2018.

Non-GAAP financial measure 

The Corporation has used non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release. “Adjusted net income (loss)” presented in this release is defined as reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods. “Adjusted income (loss) before income taxes” presented in this release is defined as income (loss) before income taxes excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods. “Cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities” presented in this release is defined as Cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities. Management uses adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted income (loss) before income taxes to evaluate the Corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these measures, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations. Management believes that cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities demonstrates the Corporation’s ability to internally fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and service debt.
