IDEXX Laboratories Announces Estimated Impact of U.S. Tax Reform

WESTBROOK, Maine, Jan. 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. ("IDEXX" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: IDXX), a global leader in veterinary diagnostics, veterinary practice software and water microbiology testing, expects the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Legislation") to benefit the Company by reducing its recurring effective tax rate beginning in 2018 by approximately 750-850 basis points. The Company also estimates that the enactment of the Tax Legislation will result in a one-time reduction of approximately $35 million - $45 million in the Company's earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, due to the deemed repatriation of the Company's foreign profits, net of the remeasurement of U.S. deferred taxes at the lower enacted corporate tax rate and other adjustments.

The impact of the Tax Legislation may differ from the estimates above, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Legislation. The Company will continue to analyze the Tax Legislation to determine the full effects of the new law, including the new lower corporate tax rate, on the Corporation's financial statements and operations. 

The Company will announce financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 on February 1, 2018.
