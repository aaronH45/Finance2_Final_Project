[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company implemented organizational changes to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. These organizational changes primarily include: (i) the transfer of the former Servers and Storage business units, the Pointnext and Communications and Media Solutions ("CMS") businesses within the former Technology Services business unit, and the data center networking business within the former Networking business unit, all of which were previously reported within the former Enterprise Group ("EG") segment, to the newly formed Hybrid IT segment; (ii) the transfer of the remaining networking products businesses, which include wireless LAN, campus and branch switching and edge compute within the former Networking business unit, and Aruba services within the former Technology Services business unit, all of which were previously reported within the former EG segment, to the newly formed Intelligent Edge segment; and (iii) the transfer of cloud-related activities previously reported within Corporate Investments to the Hybrid IT segment.

The Company reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented, which primarily resulted in: (i) the transfer of net revenue, related eliminations of intersegment revenues and operating profit from the former Servers and Storage business units, the Pointnext and CMS businesses within the former Technology Services business unit and the data center networking business within the former Networking business unit, all of which were previously reported within the former EG segment, to the Hybrid IT segment; (ii) the transfer of net revenue, related eliminations of intersegment revenues and operating profit from the remaining networking products businesses within the former Networking business unit, and Aruba services within the former Technology Services business unit, all of which were previously reported within the former EG segment, to the Intelligent Edge segment; and (iii) the transfer of the operating loss from cloud-related activities previously reported within Corporate Investments to the Hybrid IT segment.

These changes had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share.

(b) Effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company implemented certain changes to its allocation methodology for stock-based compensation expense and certain corporate costs, which align to its segment financial reporting and are consistent with the manner in which the operating segments will be evaluated for performance on a prospective basis.

The Company reflected these changes retrospectively to the earliest period presented, which resulted in: (i) the transfer of a portion of stock-based compensation expense, which under the prior allocation methodology was not allocated to the segments, to the Hybrid IT, Intelligent Edge and Financial Services segments; and (ii) the transfer of certain corporate function costs previously allocated to the segments to unallocated corporate costs.

These changes had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's previously reported consolidated and combined earnings from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share.
