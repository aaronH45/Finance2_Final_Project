3YR OUTLOOK & 2017 RESULTS 

Forward Looking Statements and Related Matters This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The words “may,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “could,” “budget,” “objectives,” “strategy,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “target,” “goal,” “plan,” “should,” “will,” “predict,” “guidance,” “potential” or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Other than historical facts included in this presentation, all information and statements, including but not limited to information regarding planned capital expenditures, estimated reserves, estimated production targets and commodity mix, estimated pre-tax wellhead rates of return, estimated future operating costs and other expenses and other financial measures, estimated future tax rates, drilling and development plans, the timing of production, and other plans and objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Although, as of the date of this presentation, Newfield believes that these expectations are reasonable, this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks and no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including but not limited to commodity prices and our ability to hedge commodity prices, drilling results, changes in commodity mix, accessibility to economic transportation modes and processing facilities, our liquidity and the availability of capital resources, operating risks, failures and hazards, industry conditions, governmental regulations in the areas in which we operate, including water regulations, financial counterparty risks, the prices of goods and services, the availability of drilling rigs and other support services, our ability to monetize assets and repay or refinance our existing indebtedness, labor conditions, severe weather conditions, new regulations or changes in tax or environmental legislation, environmental liabilities not covered by indemnity or insurance, legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity or induced seismicity, and other operating risks. Please see Newfield’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other subsequent public filings, all filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for a discussion of other factors that may cause actual results to vary. Unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed herein or in Newfield’s SEC filings could also have material adverse effects on Newfield’s actual results as compared to its anticipated results. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this presentation. Unless legally required, Newfield undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 2 

Forward Looking Statements and Related Matters (continued) 3 This presentation has been prepared by Newfield and includes market data and other statistical information from sources believed by Newfield to be reliable, including independent industry publications, government publications or other published independent sources. Some data are also based on Newfield’s good faith estimates, which are derived from its review of internal sources as well as the independent sources described above. Although Newfield believes these sources are reliable, it has not independently verified the information and cannot guarantee its accuracy and completeness. Actual quantities that may be ultimately recovered from Newfield’s interests may differ substantially from the estimates in this presentation. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of Newfield’s ongoing drilling program, which will be directly affected by commodity prices (including our ability to hedge commodity prices) and our pre-tax wellhead rates of return, the availability of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation and processing constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors, and actual drilling results, including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates and commodity mix. Newfield may use terms in this presentation, such as “EURs,” “unrisked location,” “risked locations,” “net effective reservoir acreage,” “upside potential,” “net unrisked resource,” “gross EURs,” and similar terms that the SEC’s guidelines strictly prohibit in SEC filings. These terms include reserves with substantially less certainty than proved reserves, and no discount or other adjustment is included in the presentation of such reserve numbers. Investors are urged to consider closely the oil and gas disclosures in Newfield’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent public filings, available at www.newfield.com, www.sec.gov or by writing Newfield at 4 Waterway Square Place, Suite 100, The Woodlands, Texas 77380 Attn: Investor Relations. In addition, this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures, which include, but are not limited to, Adjusted EBITDA. Newfield defines EBITDA as net income/loss before income tax expense/benefit, interest expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented herein, is EBITDA before ceiling test impairments, gains/losses on asset sales, non-cash compensation expense, net unrealized (gains) / losses on commodity derivatives and other permitted adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and does not represent net income as defined under GAAP, and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure used by Newfield’s management and by securities analysts, lenders, ratings agencies and others who follow the industry as an indicator of Newfield’s ability to internally fund exploration and development activities. NOTE: All numbered references throughout document are defined in Endnotes beginning on page 45 of this presentation.

See legend on page 3 for more information. 10) Below $44.00 for 3Q18 and 4Q18, these contracts effectively result in realized prices that are on average $12.78 per Bbl higher, than the cash price that otherwise would have been realized. 11) The collars for 2Q18 were created by buying back our short puts that were part of 3-way transactions. The short puts were purchased with funds derived by selling 3,000 Bbl/d of $59 call swaptions with an expiry of March 15, 2018. 12) Below $39.76 for 1Q18 and $39.47 for 4Q18 these contracts effectively result in realized prices that are $9.08 and $8.87 per Bbl higher, respectively by quarter, than the cash price that otherwise would have been realized. We have converted several of our 3-way structures into swaps by buying short puts, selling long puts, and buying calls, then embedding the option cost into the swap price. 13) Below $40.47 for 1Q19, $40.48 for 2Q19, $40.80 for 3Q19, and $40.82 for 4Q19 these contracts effectively result in realized prices that are $10.06, $10.03, $9.89, and $9.89 per Bbl higher, respectively by quarter, than the cash price that otherwise would have been realized. 14) Below $2.60 for 1Q18-3Q18 and below $2.66 for 4Q18, these contracts effectively result in realized prices that are on average $.37 per MMBtu higher, than the cash price that otherwise would have been realized. 15) Below $2.30 for 2Q18-4Q18 these contracts effectively result in realized prices that are $.57 per MMBtu higher than the cash price that otherwise would have been realized. These 3-way structures were created by selling a $2.30 put to enhance collars already in place. 47 

Key Definitions Adjusted EBITDA – Newfield defines EBITDA as net income/loss before income tax expense/benefit, interest expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented herein, is EBITDA before ceiling test impairments, gains/losses on asset sales, non-cash compensation expense, net unrealized (gains) / losses on commodity derivatives and other permitted adjustments. See legend on page 3 for more information. Average Completed Well Cost – Includes capital associated with drilling, completions, facilities and artificial lift. All estimates shown are expected to be within +/- 5% of the values illustrated. Cash Flow – Net income plus DD&A, non-cash stock compensation, deferred tax provision, unrealized loss (gain) on derivative contracts, ceiling text and other impairments, and other non-cash operating items. CNEY – Represents Caney Formation of the Anadarko Basin. Controllable Capital (CAPEX) – Defined as capital expenditures associated with the drilling, completion, facilities, artificial lift, recompletions and plugging and abandoning of wellbores plus FF&E, seismic and leasehold capital expenditures and construction capital and other capital associated with oil and gas assets. All estimates shown are expected to be within +/- 5% of the values illustrated.
