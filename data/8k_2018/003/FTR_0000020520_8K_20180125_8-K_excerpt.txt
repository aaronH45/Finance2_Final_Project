Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement  

On January 25, 2018, Frontier Communications Corporation (“Frontier” or the “Company”) entered into amendments (the “Amendments”) to (i) its first amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of February 27, 2017, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto, (ii) its credit agreement, dated as of June 2, 2014, with CoBank, ACB, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto, and (iii) its credit agreement, dated as of October 12, 2016, with CoBank, ACB, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto. Among other things, the Amendments replace the Company’s net leverage ratio maintenance test of 5.25 to 1.00 with a first lien net leverage ratio maintenance test which provides for a maximum first lien net leverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, stepping down to 1.35 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2020 and thereafter, providing Frontier with greater flexibility in executing on operational initiatives going forward. The Amendments also modify the covenants to provide for junior lien capacity on any indebtedness permitted under the credit agreements, while limiting the incurrence of first lien debt. Pursuant to the Amendments, Frontier agreed to, among other things, expand the security package to include the equity interests of certain subsidiaries not previously pledged.  

The foregoing description of the Amendments is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amendments, copies of which are filed with this report as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein.
