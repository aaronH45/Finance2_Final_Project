Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On February 20, 2018, FirstEnergy Corp. (FirstEnergy or Company) issued two public documents regarding, among other things, results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and provided guidance for 2018. FirstEnergy’s Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community, which are attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, hereto and incorporated herein by reference, contain non-GAAP financial measures. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G and Item 10(e)(i) of Regulation S-K, FirstEnergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within the Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The information set forth in and incorporated into this Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any of the Company’s filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, whether made before or after the date hereof and regardless of any general incorporation language in such filings, except to the extent expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

The attached Press Release and Consolidated Report to the Financial Community contain references to non-GAAP financial measures including, among others, Operating earnings (losses); Regulated operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share; Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share - Operating, calculated on a segment basis; Adjusted Equity; Adjusted Debt; and Adjusted Capitalization. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Operating earnings (losses) are not calculated in accordance with GAAP because they exclude the impact of “special items”. Regulated operating (non-GAAP) earnings (losses) per share are not calculated in accordance with GAAP because they exclude the CES segment and to the extent they exclude “special items.” Special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that management believes are not indicative of, or may obscure trends useful in evaluating the Company’s ongoing core activities and results of operations or otherwise warrant separate classification. Special items are not necessarily non-recurring. The Company’s management cannot estimate on a forward looking basis the impact of these items because these items, which could be significant, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. Regulated Operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share are calculated based on the regulated distribution and regulated transmission segments, and including the corporate segment, divided by the basic weighted average shares outstanding for the period. Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share - Operating for each segment is calculated by dividing segment Operating earnings (losses), which exclude special items as discussed above, by the basic weighted average shares outstanding for the period. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures such as Operating earnings (losses) and Regulated operating (non-GAAP) earnings (losses) per share to evaluate the Company’s performance and manage its operations and frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision-making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons. Additionally, management uses Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share - Operating, by segment, to further evaluate FirstEnergy’s performance by segment and references this non-GAAP financial measure in its decision-making. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of Operating earnings (losses), Regulated operating (non-GAAP) earnings (losses) per share and Basic Earnings (Loss) Per Share - Operating, by segment, provide consistent and comparable measures of performance of its businesses on an ongoing basis. Management also believes that such measures are useful to shareholders and other interested parties to understand performance trends and evaluate the Company against its peer group by presenting period-over-period operating results without the effect of certain charges or benefits that may not be consistent or comparable across periods or across the Company’s peer group. Management uses Adjusted Equity, Adjusted Debt, and Adjusted Capitalization to calculate and monitor its compliance with the debt to total capitalization financial covenants under the FirstEnergy credit facility. These financial measures, as calculated in accordance with the FirstEnergy credit facility, help shareholders understand FirstEnergy's compliance with, and provide a basis for understanding FirstEnergy's incremental debt capacity under, the debt to total capitalization financial covenants. The financial covenants require FirstEnergy to maintain a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio, as defined in the facilities, of no more than 65%, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. All of these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to complement, and are not considered as alternatives to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Also, the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities.

Dividends declared from time to time on FirstEnergy Corp.'s common stock and thereby on FirstEnergy Corp.'s preferred stock, during any period may in the aggregate vary from prior periods due to circumstances considered by FirstEnergy Corp.'s Board of Directors at the time of the actual declarations. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. These forward-looking statements are also qualified by, and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements and risks that are included in our filings with the SEC, including but not limited to the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. These risks, unless otherwise indicated, are presented on a consolidated basis for FirstEnergy; if and to the extent a deconsolidation occurs with respect to certain FirstEnergy companies, the risks described herein may materially change. The foregoing review of factors also should not be construed as exhaustive. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor assess the impact of any such factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise, except as required by law, any forward-looking statements contained herein as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
