(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

Awards to Certain Executive Officers under the Target Incentive Plan (“TIP”) for 2018

On February 19, 2018, the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of McDonald's Corporation (the “Company”) approved the payout structure for the 2018 TIP awards for executives.

The target 2018 TIP awards for the Company’s “named executive officers” for whom disclosure was required in the Company’s most recent proxy statement (and who remain employed with the Company) are as shown in the table below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

TIP payouts will be determined primarily by growth in the Company’s operating income in 2018 over its 2017 operating income. The officers listed above are not eligible to receive a TIP payout if the Company (and/or an applicable business segment) does not achieve growth in operating income in 2018. Operating income is measured on a consolidated or business segment level basis, as applicable to each individual’s award. For Messrs. Easterbrook and Ozan and Ms. Lagnado, the payout will be based on consolidated performance. For Mr. Goare, the payout will be based on a combination of the performance of the International Lead Markets segment and consolidated performance.

In addition to operating income performance, 2018 TIP payouts to the officers listed above may also be impacted, positively or negatively, by the Company’s performance against certain pre-established modifiers that are closely linked to the Company’s Velocity Growth Plan.

The maximum TIP award that any of the above individuals can earn in 2018 is 200% of the target award.

For compensation purposes, operating income may be adjusted from that reported in our financial statements. Specifically, operating income is expressed in constant currencies to more accurately reflect underlying business trends. In addition, certain income and/or expense items that are not indicative of ongoing results may be excluded at the discretion of the Committee.
