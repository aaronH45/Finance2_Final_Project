Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On January 22, 2018, registrant issued a press release entitled “Halliburton Announces Fourth Quarter 2017 Results."

The text of the Press Release is as follows:

HALLIBURTON ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER 2017 RESULTS

•Reported loss from continuing operations of $0.92 per diluted share, reflecting charges related to U.S. tax reform and Venezuela receivables 

•Adjusted income from continuing operations of $0.53 per diluted share 

HOUSTON - January 22, 2018 - Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) announced today a loss from continuing operations of $805 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017, excluding charges related to United States tax reform and Venezuela receivables, was $462 million, or $0.53 per diluted share. This compares to income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2017 of $365 million, or $0.42 per diluted share. Halliburton's total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.9 billion, a 9% increase from revenue of $5.4 billion in the third quarter of 2017. Reported operating income was $379 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to operating income of $634 million in the third quarter of 2017. Excluding special items, adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $764 million.

Total revenue for the full year of 2017 was $20.6 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion, or 30%, from 2016. Reported operating income for 2017 was $1.4 billion, compared to a reported operating loss of $6.8 billion for 2016. Excluding special items, adjusted operating income for 2017 was $2.0 billion, a three-fold improvement from adjusted operating income of $690 million for 2016.

“Outstanding execution resulted in an excellent fourth quarter and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities presented by a growing North America market and improving international outlook. I continue to believe we are on the path to normalized margins in North America in 2018,” remarked Jeff Miller, President and CEO. 

“2017 was a dynamic year for the oil and gas sector that marked another step on the road to recovery for our industry. I am pleased with the way our team executed on our value proposition, maintained strong service quality, and generated superior results and industry leading returns.

“Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered an impressive performance over the second half of 2017, achieving nearly 50% incrementals in the fourth quarter. These results demonstrate the strength and diversity of our portfolio. 

“Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 8% sequentially, outperforming the change in average United States land rig count. The North America completions market is tight, and demand for our completions equipment and our service quality remains strong.

“I am optimistic about what I see in 2018. Commodity prices are supportive of increasing activity in North America and I am encouraged by the increase in tender activity and the positive discussions we are having with our international customers,” concluded Miller.

Operating Segments

Completion and Production

Completion and Production revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.8 billion, an increase of $267 million, or 8%, from the third quarter of 2017, while operating income was $552 million, a sequential increase of $27 million, or 5%. In the United States land sector, higher pressure pumping activity and pricing led to increased revenue while higher costs and seasonality hindered profitability. Additionally, results improved due to year-end completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico, higher software sales in Latin America and increased stimulation activity in the Eastern Hemisphere. 

Drilling and Evaluation

Drilling and Evaluation revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.1 billion, an increase of $229 million, or 12%, from the third quarter of 2017, while operating income was $291 million, an increase of $111 million, or 62%. These increases were primarily due to increased drilling activity in the Middle East and North America and higher software sales and services in Latin America.

Corporate and Other Events

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law, effective January 1, 2018. Halliburton recorded an aggregate $882 million of non-cash discrete tax charges in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of preliminary tax provisions for the net impact of this tax law. Halliburton is continuing its analysis of tax reform impact on the company, and this provisional amount is subject to change. 

Regarding Venezuela, Halliburton continues to experience delays in collecting payments on receivables from our primary customer. These delayed payments, combined with recent credit rating downgrades and deteriorating market condition in Venezuela, required Halliburton to record an aggregate charge of $385 million during the fourth quarter under GAAP. This charge represents a fair market value adjustment on its existing promissory note and a full reserve against other accounts receivables with this customer. Halliburton actively manages its strategic relationship with this customer and will continue to vigorously pursue collections as it does business going forward. 

Geographic Regions

North America

North America revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.4 billion, a 7% increase sequentially. This improvement was driven primarily by increased utilization and pricing throughout the United States land sector in the majority of Halliburton’s product service lines, primarily pressure pumping, as well as higher drilling activity and completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico.

International

International revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.5 billion, an 11% increase sequentially, resulting primarily from increased activity across multiple product services lines in Latin America, and increases in drilling and stimulation activity in the Eastern Hemisphere.

Latin America revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $615 million, a 16% increase sequentially, driven by increased drilling activity and higher software sales in Brazil, higher software sales in Mexico and increased stimulation activity in Argentina. These results were partially offset by reduced drilling activity in Venezuela.

Europe/Africa/CIS revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $776 million, a 7% increase sequentially, primarily due to higher drilling activity in the North Sea, coupled with increased activity in Algeria and Egypt. These results were partially offset by a reduction in completion tool sales in Nigeria.

Middle East/Asia revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.1 billion, a 12% increase sequentially, primarily resulting from increased drilling and stimulation activity in the Middle East and year-end sales in China.

Selective Technology & Highlights

•Halliburton announced the release of Geometrix™ 4D Shaped Cutters, a line of four distinct geometric profiles to help improve cutting efficiency and increase control to reduce drilling costs. Halliburton now offers the largest portfolio of shaped cutters in the oil and gas industry.

•Sperry Drilling announced the release of JetPulse™ high-speed telemetry service, which provides consistent, high-data rate transmission of drilling and formation evaluation measurements. This new telemetry system helps operators make faster decisions to optimize well placement and improve well control while increasing drilling efficiency. It provides the highest lost circulation material (LCM) tolerance of any high-speed telemetry system, helping the operator pump the required LCM concentration to cure mud losses without changing or plugging the bottom hole assembly. The system also reduced flat time in the drilling curve, maximizes rate of penetration and optimizes reservoir contact by combining new telemetry technology with measurement/logging-while-drilling (M/LWD) services.

•In October 2017, Halliburton announced the release of Marine Sentry™ 3000, a rotating control device that provides a pressure control solution by creating a seal around the drill string and tool joints for safer containment of fluids during conventional or controlled pressure drilling operations. The device is mounted on a rig’s surface blowout preventer and monitors key functions to help reduce cost and environmental impact while improving overall well safety in pressure critical locations.

•Halliburton announced the release of BaraShale™ Lite Fluid System, a high performance water-based fluid designed to maintain full salt saturation with reduced density, help prevent lost circulation and minimize waste disposal costs. Operators in formations containing salt layers and low fracture pressure face major challenges while drilling. BaraShale Lite fluid helps operators overcome these challenges using a proprietary additive that tightly combines the base fluid, which consists of brine to prevent salt washout, and oil to lighten the mud weight. Operators can mix the fluid quickly on-site instead of in large batches and reuse fluids for maximizing their operational efficiency. It also helps ensure proper zonal isolation to increase completion efficiency and prevent the loss of cement in the formation.

•Halliburton announced the release of the Electromagnetic Pipe Xaminer® V (EPX™ V) service - the industry’s first technology allowing operators to pinpoint casing defects and metal corrosion in up to five tubular strings within the well. This innovative new service utilizes proprietary sensor technologies and customized processing algorithms to accurately identify potential well integrity issues and reduce the likelihood of production disruptions for operators. The EPX V complements Halliburton’s growing portfolio of corrosion inspection tools and other industry-leading well integrity diagnostic services, including the Acoustic Conformation Xaminer® (ACX™) service, which accurately identifies the location of wellbore leaks.

•In November 2017, Halliburton announced that it worked with the Akwa Ibom state government to inaugurate and open Nigeria's first oil and gas training center fully-equipped with oilfield operations tools. The Akwa Ibom Oil and Gas Training and Research Center will provide courses in field development, drilling and completions engineering, well intervention solutions and digital technologies to local energy employees and students. Halliburton Landmark will provide the training curriculum, instructors, software, workstations and tools to be used in the classroom.
