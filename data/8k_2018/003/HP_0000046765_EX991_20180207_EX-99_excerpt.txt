U.S. Land Drilling Market Conditions Higher oil prices boding well for increasing drilling demand and continuing dayrate improvement Customer level of interest in putting additional rigs to work has increased since our most recent conference call (January 25, 2018) Continue to experience additional demand for super-spec rigs as replacement cycle persists and well complexity increases Increasing our capital expenditures estimate to a range of $350 to $400 million (from ~$350 million) for fiscal 2018 as a result of recent improvement in market conditions Average FlexRig spot pricing still in high-teens, while leading-edge super-spec FlexRig pricing is in the low-to-mid $20k/day range 

Second Fiscal Quarter H&P Outlook (As of February 7, 2018) Drilling Operations Outlook for 2Q of Fiscal 2018 Compared to 1Q of Fiscal 2018 U.S. Land Segment Revenue days now expected to increase by approximately 2% (representing a 4% increase in the average number of active rigs given the lower number of calendar days during the second fiscal quarter) Average rig revenue per day still expected to be roughly flat to slightly up (excluding any impact from early termination revenue) Average rig expense per day now expected to be roughly $14,000 Offshore Segment Revenue days still expected to decrease by approximately 2% (as a result of the lower number of calendar days during the second fiscal quarter) Average rig margin per day still expected to be approximately $11,500 Management contracts still expected to generate approximately $4 million in operating income International Land Segment Revenue days still expected to decrease by approximately 4% (representing a 2% decline in the average number of active rigs given the lower number of calendar days during the second fiscal quarter) Average rig margin per day still expected to be roughly $8,000 Other Estimates for Fiscal 2018 Capital expenditures are now expected to be in the range of approximately $350 to $400 million The estimate for general and administrative expenses is still expected at approximately $180 million

FlexRig Family of SolutionsTM - Pad Design FlexRig3 skid system is designed to meet the requirements for standard pad drilling. Typically customers drill 2-4 wells per pad. FlexRig5 skid system is a bi-directional design, with the typical pad having 2-4 wells, and in some cases range from 6-8 wells. The “walking” option for the FlexRig3 will enable us to capture additional market share and will enhance our Family of SolutionsTM offering. As a result of customer demand, we continue to upgrade standard FlexRig3s with skid and walking systems.

Center of Excellence – Tulsa, OK Support Structure Data Analysis Best Practices 24/7 Technical and Performance Solutions: 

H&P Adding to the Family of SolutionsTM Recent MOTIVE and MagVAR acquisitions create a powerful software platform and compelling value opportunity for E&P companies Offers flexibility to select best technology regardless of drilling contractor Brings new level of accuracy to directional drilling MOTIVE-guided wells significantly outperform non-MOTIVE wells MagVAR services reduce surveying uncertainty by 50-60%, increases horizontal well economics while reducing risk 

MOTIVE Drilling Technologies, Inc. MOTIVE’s proprietary Bit Guidance System is a unique directional drilling technology. Industry leader in the use of cognitive computing to guide the directional drilling process Algorithm-driven system More than 350 horizontal wells to date and over 4.5 million feet drilled across all of the major U.S. shale plays and Canada MOTIVE has the ability to provide decision automation. More accurate well placement Smoother, better quality wellbores More efficient drilling (faster and with better accuracy) Consistently lower drilling costs Potential for increased hydrocarbon production MOTIVE will remain available to all E&P operators and directional drilling service providers regardless of which drilling rig contractor is used. 

MOTIVE Case Study Industry Problem: Higher than expected drilling and lifting costs due to the inability to consistently follow a prescribed well path and to hit and stay within the targets identified collectively by the operator’s geologists, geophysicists, and reservoir engineers. H&P Solution: MOTIVE™ Bit Guidance System. Goes beyond traditional directional drilling by providing task automation, forward modeling, real-time learning, and automated decision-making to guide the steering of the bit while considering the economic consequences of all decisions. Case Study Evidence (Eagle Ford): two sets of four wells drilled (one guided by MOTIVE and one without it), with nearly identical lithologies, well path geometries, drill bits, BHAs, and other associated rig equipment, and at approximately the same time. Results: 30% lower effective directional drilling cost with nearly twice the accuracy and zero non-productive time (NPT). Conclusion: The MOTIVE-guided wells significantly outperformed the non-MOTIVE wells in each of the sections drilled. 

MagVAR MagVAR is a leading provider of MWD geomagnetic referencing and survey quality management Real-time center serving active horizontal rigs drilling in North America Utilized for over 40 E&P companies 3,000+ wells analyzed and corrected 

Well Placement is Critical MagVAR services reduce standard surveying uncertainty by 50-60%, increasing horizontal well economics while reducing risk. Precise well placement enables maximum reservoir drainage More accurate positional data leads to better geological models Less positional uncertainty reduces risk of well on well collision Maintaining accurate well spacing reduces occurrences of frac hits during completions 

Customer Satisfaction Matters Value creation for the customer is not only driven by having the right rig. It is also driven by service; the ability of an organization to deliver top performance with that rig. Better service drives value, customer satisfaction, market share and pricing. H&P has been rated 1st in total customer satisfaction for nine years in a row.* When combined with capital discipline, customer satisfaction also drives shareholder value. * Please refer to EnergyPoint Research.
