PHOENIX, AZ, January 25, 2018 - Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX) reported net income attributable to common stock of $1.0 billion ($0.71 per share) for fourth-quarter 2017 and $1.8 billion ($1.25 per share) for the year 2017, compared with net income attributable to common stock of $292 million ($0.21 per share) for fourth-quarter 2016 and a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.2 billion ($3.16 per share) for the year 2016. After adjusting for net gains of $291 million ($0.20 per share) primarily related to tax benefits associated with U.S. tax reform, partly offset by charges for adjustments to environmental obligations, adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $750 million ($0.51 per share) for fourth-quarter 2017. Refer to the supplemental schedule, "Adjusted Net Income," on page VII, which is available on FCX's website, "fcx.com," for additional information.

Richard C. Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "During 2017, our global team’s focus on productivity and cost and capital discipline, together with improved market conditions for copper, produced solid results. We generated strong cash flows, continued to strengthen our balance sheet and advanced several long-term initiatives to build value for shareholders. Our actions during 2016 and 2017 achieved our debt reduction objectives efficiently while retaining a strong asset base for the future. As we enter 2018, our shareholders are well positioned to benefit from our global leadership position in copper, supported by a large, high-quality portfolio of long-lived geographically diverse assets and favorable copper market conditions. We are continuing to make significant progress in our ongoing negotiations with the Indonesian government to restore long-term stability for our Grasberg operations as we remain focused on executing our business strategy for the benefit of our shareholders and other stakeholders."

Consolidated Sales Volumes

Fourth-quarter 2017 copper sales of 1.0 billion pounds approximated the October 2017 estimate and were lower than fourth-quarter 2016 sales of 1.1 billion pounds, primarily reflecting lower sales volumes in North America and at Cerro Verde. 

Fourth-quarter 2017 gold sales of 593 thousand ounces were lower than the October 2017 estimate of 625 thousand ounces, primarily reflecting lower mill rates at PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI). Fourth-quarter 2017 gold sales were higher than fourth-quarter 2016 sales of 405 thousand ounces, primarily reflecting anticipated higher ore grades from Indonesia. 

Fourth-quarter 2017 molybdenum sales of 24 million pounds were slightly higher than the October 2017 estimate of 23 million pounds and fourth-quarter 2016 sales of 22 million pounds.

Sales volumes for the year 2018 are expected to approximate 3.9 billion pounds of copper, 2.4 million ounces of gold and 91 million pounds of molybdenum, including 1.0 billion pounds of copper, 675 thousand ounces of gold and 24 million pounds of molybdenum in first-quarter 2018.

Consolidated Unit Costs 

Consolidated average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for FCX's copper mines of $1.04 per pound of copper in fourth-quarter 2017 were lower than unit net cash costs of $1.21 per pound in fourth-quarter 2016, primarily reflecting higher by-product credits, partly offset by lower copper sales volumes and higher mining and milling costs in South America. 

Assuming average prices of $1,300 per ounce of gold and $10.00 per pound of molybdenum for 2018 and achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates, consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for copper mines are expected to average $0.97 per pound of copper for the year 2018. The impact of price changes on 2018 consolidated unit net cash costs would approximate $0.03 per pound for each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold and $0.025 per pound for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum. Quarterly unit net cash costs vary with fluctuations in sales volumes and realized prices, primarily for gold and molybdenum. 

MINING OPERATIONS 

North America Copper Mines. FCX operates seven open-pit copper mines in North America - Morenci, Bagdad, Safford, Sierrita and Miami in Arizona, and Chino and Tyrone in New Mexico. In addition to copper, certain of FCX's North America copper mines produce molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver. 

All of the North America mining operations are wholly owned, except for Morenci. FCX records its 72 percent undivided joint venture interest in Morenci using the proportionate consolidation method. 

Operating and Development Activities.  FCX has significant undeveloped reserves and resources in North America and a portfolio of potential long-term development projects. Future investments will be undertaken based on the results of economic and technical feasibility studies, and are dependent on market conditions. FCX continues to study opportunities to reduce the capital intensity of its potential long-term development projects. 

Through exploration drilling, FCX has identified a significant resource at its wholly owned Lone Star project located near the Safford operation in eastern Arizona. FCX has commenced a project to develop the Lone Star oxide ores with first production expected by the end of 2020. Total estimated capital costs for the project, including mine equipment and pre-production stripping, approximates $850 million and will benefit from the utilization of existing infrastructure at the adjacent Safford operation. Production from the Lone Star oxide ores is expected to average approximately 200 million pounds of copper per year with an approximate 20-year mine life. The project also advances the potential for development of a larger-scale district opportunity. FCX is conducting additional drilling as it continues to evaluate longer term opportunities available from the significant sulfide potential in the Lone Star/Safford minerals district.

Operating Data.  Following is summary consolidated operating data for the North America copper mines for the fourth quarters and years 2017 and 2016: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

a.Refer to summary operating data on page 3 for FCX's consolidated molybdenum sales, which includes sales of molybdenum produced at the North America copper mines.

b.For a reconciliation of unit net cash costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements, refer to the supplemental schedules, "Product Revenues and Production Costs," beginning on page XII, which are available on FCX's website, "fcx.com." 

North America's consolidated copper sales volumes of 354 million pounds in fourth-quarter 2017 were lower than fourth-quarter 2016 sales of 416 million pounds, primarily reflecting anticipated lower ore grades. North America copper sales are estimated to approximate 1.5 billion pounds for the year 2018, compared with 1.5 billion pounds in 2017.

Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for the North America copper mines of $1.68 per pound of copper in fourth-quarter 2017 were higher than unit net cash costs of $1.44 per pound in fourth-quarter 2016, primarily reflecting lower sales volumes.

Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for the North America copper mines are expected to approximate $1.67 per pound of copper for the year 2018, based on achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average molybdenum price of $10.00 per pound. North America's average unit net cash costs for the year 2018 would change by approximately $0.04 per pound for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum. 

South America Mining.  FCX operates two copper mines in South America - Cerro Verde in Peru (in which FCX owns a 53.56 percent interest) and El Abra in Chile (in which FCX owns a 51 percent interest). These operations are consolidated in FCX's financial statements. In addition to copper, the Cerro Verde mine produces molybdenum concentrate and silver. 

Operating and Development Activities. The Cerro Verde expansion project commenced operations in September 2015. The project expanded the concentrator facilities from 120,000 metric tons of ore per day to 360,000 metric tons of ore per day, and averaged 374,200 metric tons of ore per day in fourth-quarter 2017. Cerro Verde's expanded operations benefit from its large-scale, long-lived reserves and cost efficiencies. 

FCX continues to evaluate a major expansion at El Abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries. Exploration results at El Abra indicate a significant sulfide resource, which could potentially support a major mill project similar to facilities recently constructed at Cerro Verde. Future investments will depend on technical studies, which are being advanced, economic factors and market conditions.

South America's consolidated copper sales volumes of 312 million pounds in fourth-quarter 2017 were lower than fourth-quarter 2016 sales of 359 million pounds, primarily reflecting lower recovery rates at Cerro Verde. Sales from South America mining are expected to approximate 1.2 billion pounds of copper for the year 2018, compared with 1.2 billion pounds of copper in 2017. 

Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for South America mining of $1.73 per pound of copper in fourth-quarter 2017 were higher than unit net cash costs of $1.51 per pound in fourth-quarter 2016, primarily reflecting lower sales volumes and higher mining and milling costs at Cerro Verde, partly offset by higher by-product credits. Average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for South America mining are expected to approximate $1.63 per pound of copper for the year 2018, based on current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average price of $10.00 per pound of molybdenum.

Indonesia Mining.  Through its 90.64 percent owned and consolidated subsidiary PT-FI, FCX's assets include one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits at the Grasberg minerals district in Papua, Indonesia. PT-FI operates a proportionately consolidated joint venture, which produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver.

Regulatory Matters. PT-FI continues to actively engage with Indonesian government officials to address regulatory changes that conflict with its contractual rights in a manner that provides long-term stability for PT-FI’s operations and investment plans, and protects value for FCX’s shareholders.

Following a framework understanding reached in August 2017, the parties have been engaged in negotiation and documentation of a special license (IUPK) and accompanying documentation for assurances on legal and fiscal terms to provide PT-FI with long-term rights through 2041. In addition, the IUPK would provide that PT-FI construct a smelter within five years of reaching a definitive agreement and include agreement for the divestment of 51 percent of the project area interests to Indonesian participants at fair market value.

Freeport-McMoRan

In late 2017, the Indonesian government (including the regional government of Papua Province and Mimika Regency) and PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Inalum), a state-owned enterprise, which will lead a consortium of investors, agreed to form a special purpose company to acquire Grasberg project area interests. Inalum is owned 100 percent by the Indonesian government and currently holds 9.36 percent of PT-FI's outstanding common stock. 

FCX is engaged in discussions with Inalum and PT-FI’s joint venture partner regarding potential arrangements that would result in the Inalum consortium acquiring interests that would meet the Indonesian government’s 51 percent ownership objective in a manner satisfactory to all parties, and in a structure that would provide for continuity of FCX’s management of PT-FI’s operations and governance of the business. The parties continue to negotiate documentation on a comprehensive agreement for PT-FI’s extended operations and to reach agreement on timing, process and governance matters relating to the divestment. The parties have a mutual objective of completing negotiations and the required documentation during the first half of 2018.

In December 2017, the Indonesian government extended PT-FI’s temporary IUPK to June 30, 2018, and PT-FI is seeking an extension of its export license which currently expires on February 16, 2018, to enable normal operations to continue during the negotiation period. 

Until a definitive agreement is reached, PT-FI has reserved all rights under its Contract of Work (COW).

Operating and Development Activities. PT-FI is currently mining the final phase of the Grasberg open pit, which contains high copper and gold ore grades. PT-FI expects to mine high-grade ore over the next several quarters prior to transitioning to the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine in the first half of 2019.

PT-FI has several projects in the Grasberg minerals district related to the development of its large-scale, long-lived, high-grade underground ore bodies. In aggregate, these underground ore bodies are expected to produce large-scale quantities of copper and gold following the transition from the Grasberg open pit. Substantial progress has been made to prepare for the transition to mining of the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine. Mine development activities are sufficiently advanced to commence caving in early 2019. The ore flow system and underground rail line are expected to be installed during 2018.

Subject to reaching a definitive agreement with the Indonesian government to support PT-FI's long-term investment plans, estimated annual capital spending on these projects would average $0.9 billion per year ($0.7 billion per year net to PT-FI) over the next five years. Considering the long-term nature and size of these projects, actual costs could vary from these estimates. In response to market conditions and Indonesian regulatory uncertainty, timing of these expenditures continues to be reviewed. If PT-FI is unable to reach a definitive agreement with the Indonesian government on its long-term mining rights, FCX intends to reduce or defer investments significantly in its underground development projects and will pursue dispute resolution procedures under its COW.

Operating Data. Following is summary consolidated operating data for the Indonesia mining operations for the fourth quarters and years 2017 and 2016:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

a.For a reconciliation of unit net cash (credits) costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements, refer to the supplemental schedules, "Product Revenues and Production Costs," beginning on page XII, which are available on FCX's website, "fcx.com."[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Indonesia's consolidated copper sales of 351 million pounds in fourth-quarter 2017 approximated fourth-quarter 2016 sales of 352 million pounds. Indonesia's consolidated gold sales of 584 thousand ounces in fourth-quarter 2017 were higher than fourth-quarter 2016 sales of 401 thousand ounces, reflecting higher gold ore grades.

PT-FI's labor productivity continues to improve following disruptions that occurred in the first half of 2017. During fourth-quarter 2017, PT-FI and union officials reached terms for a new two-year labor agreement, effective October 1, 2017.

Assuming achievement of planned operating rates for 2018, consolidated sales volumes from Indonesia mining are expected to approximate 1.2 billion pounds of copper and 2.4 million ounces of gold for the year 2018, compared with 1.0 billion pounds of copper and 1.5 million ounces of gold for the year 2017. 

A significant portion of PT-FI's costs are fixed and unit costs vary depending on production volumes and other factors. As a result of higher gold and silver credits, Indonesia had unit net cash credits (including gold and silver credits) of $0.22 per pound of copper in fourth-quarter 2017, compared with unit net cash costs of $0.65 per pound in fourth-quarter 2016. 

Assuming an average gold price of $1,300 per ounce for 2018 and achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates, unit net cash credits (including gold and silver credits) for Indonesia mining are expected to approximate $0.57 per pound of copper for the year 2018. Indonesia mining's unit net cash credits for the year 2018 would change by approximately $0.09 per pound for each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold. Because of the fixed nature of a large portion of Indonesia's costs, unit net cash credits/costs vary from quarter to quarter depending on copper and gold volumes.

Indonesia mining's projected sales volumes for the year 2018 are dependent on a number of factors, including operational performance, workforce productivity, timing of shipments, the extension of PT-FI's export license (which currently expires on February 16, 2018), the extension of PT-FI's IUPK after June 30, 2018, and satisfactory progress on the resolution of PT-FI's long-term mining rights.

Molybdenum Mines.  FCX has two wholly owned molybdenum mines - the Henderson underground mine and the Climax open-pit mine, both in Colorado. The Henderson and Climax mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products. The majority of molybdenum concentrate produced at the Henderson and Climax mines, as well as from FCX's North America and South America copper mines, is processed at FCX's conversion facilities.

Operating and Development Activities.  Production from the Molybdenum mines totaled 8 million pounds of molybdenum in fourth-quarter 2017 and 7 million pounds in fourth-quarter 2016. Refer to summary operating data on page 3 for FCX's consolidated molybdenum sales and average realized prices, which includes sales of molybdenum produced at the Molybdenum mines, and from FCX's North America and South America copper mines.

Unit net cash costs for the Molybdenum mines averaged $8.40 per pound of molybdenum in fourth-quarter 2017 and $8.26 per pound in fourth-quarter 2016. Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, average unit net cash costs for the Molybdenum mines are expected to approximate $9.00 per pound of molybdenum for the year 2018. 

For a reconciliation of unit net cash costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements, refer to the supplemental schedules, "Product Revenues and Production Costs," beginning on page XII, which are available on FCX's website, "fcx.com."

Mining Exploration Activities. FCX's mining exploration activities are generally associated with its existing mines, focusing on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity. Exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in North America and South America. Exploration spending is expected to approximate $65 million for the year 2018, compared to $72 million in 2017.

Preliminary Recoverable Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves. FCX has significant reserves, resources and future development opportunities within its portfolio of mining assets. FCX's preliminary estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable reserves from its mines at December 31, 2017, include 86.7 billion pounds of copper, 23.5 million ounces of gold and 2.84 billion pounds of molybdenum, which were determined using $2.00 per pound for copper, $1,000 per ounce for gold and $10.00 per pound for molybdenum. The preliminary recoverable proven and probable mining reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which FCX expects to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates, where applicable. Recoverable reserve volumes are those which FCX estimates can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

a. Includes 4.4 billion pounds associated with the Lone Star project located near the Safford mine. 

In addition to the preliminary consolidated recoverable proven and probable reserves, FCX's preliminary estimated mineralized material at December 31, 2017, which was assessed using $2.20 per pound for copper, totaled 92 billion pounds of incremental contained copper (including 5 billion pounds associated with Kisanfu in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is an asset held for sale). FCX continues to pursue opportunities to convert this material into reserves, future production volumes and cash flow.

CASH FLOWS, CASH and DEBT

Operating Cash Flows.  FCX generated operating cash flows of $1.7 billion (including $0.2 billion in working capital sources and timing of other tax payments) in fourth-quarter 2017 and $4.7 billion (including $0.6 billion in working capital sources and timing of other tax payments) for the year 2017.

Based on current sales volume and cost estimates, and assuming average prices of $3.15 per pound of copper, $1,300 per ounce of gold and $10.00 per pound of molybdenum, FCX's consolidated operating cash flows are estimated to exceed $5.8 billion for the year 2018 (including $0.3 billion in working capital sources and timing of other tax payments). The impact of price changes during 2018 on operating cash flows would approximate $360 million for each $0.10 per pound change in the average price of copper, $115 million for each $50 per ounce change in the average price of gold and $130 million for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum.

Capital Expenditures.  Capital expenditures totaled $390 million for fourth-quarter 2017 (including approximately $250 million for major mining projects) and $1.4 billion for the year ended 2017 (including $0.9 billion for major mining projects). Capital expenditures are expected to approximate $2.1 billion for the year 2018, including $1.2 billion for major mining projects primarily associated with underground development activities in the Grasberg minerals district and development of the Lone Star oxide project. 

If PT-FI is unable to reach a definitive agreement with the Indonesian government on its long-term mining rights, FCX intends to reduce or defer investments significantly in its underground development projects and will pursue dispute resolution procedures under its COW.

Cautionary Statement and Regulation G Disclosure: This press release contains forward-looking statements in which FCX discusses its potential future performance. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as projections or expectations relating to ore grades and milling rates, production and sales volumes, unit net cash costs, operating cash flows, anticipated tax refunds resulting from U.S. tax reform, capital expenditures, exploration efforts and results, development and production activities and costs, liquidity, tax rates, the impact of copper, gold and molybdenum price changes, the impact of deferred intercompany profits on earnings, reserve estimates, future dividend payments, and share purchases and sales. The words “anticipates,” “may,” “can,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” "targets," “intends,” “likely,” “will,” “should,” “to be,” ”potential" and any similar expressions are intended to identify those assertions as forward-looking statements. This press release also contains forward-looking statements and estimates regarding the anticipated effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017. These statements and estimates are based on FCX's current interpretation of this legislation, which may change as a result of additional implementation guidance, changes in assumptions, and potential future refinements of or revisions to calculations. 

This press release also includes forward-looking statements regarding mineralized material not included in proven and probable mineral reserves. Mineralized material is a mineralized body that has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling and/or underground sampling to support the estimated tonnage and average metal grades. Such a deposit cannot qualify as recoverable proven and probable reserves until legal and economic feasibility are confirmed based upon a comprehensive evaluation of development costs, unit costs, grades, recoveries and other material factors. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the estimated mineralized material not included in reserves will become proven and probable reserves.

 FCX cautions readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that can cause FCX's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include supply of and demand for, and prices of, copper, gold and molybdenum; mine sequencing; production rates; potential inventory adjustments; potential impairment of long-lived mining assets; the outcome of negotiations with the Indonesian government regarding PT-FI's long-term mining rights; the potential effects of violence in Indonesia generally and in the province of Papua; industry risks; regulatory changes; political risks; labor relations; weather- and climate-related risks; environmental risks; litigation results (including the final disposition of Indonesian tax disputes and the outcome of Cerro Verde's royalty dispute with the Peruvian national tax authority); and other factors described in more detail under the heading “Risk Factors” in FCX's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the SEC as updated by FCX's subsequent filings with the SEC. With respect to FCX's operations in Indonesia, such factors include whether PT-FI will be able to resolve complex regulatory matters in Indonesia and continue to export copper after February 16, 2018.

Investors are cautioned that many of the assumptions upon which FCX's forward-looking statements are based are likely to change after the forward-looking statements are made, including for example commodity prices, which FCX cannot control, and production volumes and costs, some aspects of which FCX may not be able to control. Further, FCX may make changes to its business plans that could affect its results. FCX cautions investors that it does not intend to update forward-looking statements more frequently than quarterly notwithstanding any changes in its assumptions, changes in business plans, actual experience or other changes, and FCX undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

This press release also contains certain financial measures such as unit net cash costs per pound of copper and molybdenum, which are not recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As required by SEC Regulation G, reconciliations of these measures to amounts reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements are in the supplemental schedules of this press release, which are also available on FCX's website, "fcx.com."

e.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) enacted on December 22, 2017, includes significant modifications to existing U.S. tax laws and creates many new complex tax provisions. The Act reduces the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent, eliminates the corporate AMT, provides for a refund of AMT credit carryover, maintains hard minerals percentage depletion, allows for immediate expensing of certain qualified property and generally broadens the tax base. The Act also creates a territorial tax system (with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings), creates anti-base erosion rules that require companies to pay a minimum tax on foreign earnings and disallows certain payments from U.S. corporations to foreign related parties. FCX’s income tax provision for the fourth quarter and year 2017 includes provisional net tax credits associated with the Act totaling $393 million, including the reversal of valuation allowances associated with anticipated refunds of AMT credits over the next four years ($272 million, net of reserves) and a decrease in corporate income tax rates ($121 million). FCX’s income tax provision for the fourth quarter and year 2017 was not impacted by the Act’s one-time tax on deferred foreign earnings, as FCX has sufficient foreign tax credits to offset the tax. As the Act's tax provisions are numerous and complex, FCX continues to evaluate their impact.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

For the year 2017, FCX's mined copper was sold 59 percent in concentrate, 19 percent as cathode and 22 percent as rod from North America operations. Under the long-established structure of sales agreements prevalent in the industry, copper contained in concentrates and cathodes is provisionally priced at the time of shipment. The provisional prices are finalized in a contractually specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) primarily based on quoted monthly average spot copper prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME). Because a significant portion of FCX's copper concentrate and cathode sales in any quarterly period usually remain subject to final pricing, the quarter-end forward price is a major determinant of recorded revenues and the average recorded copper price for the period. LME spot copper prices averaged $3.09 per pound during fourth-quarter 2017, compared to FCX's average realized price of $3.21 per pound. Following is a summary of the favorable adjustments to prior periods' provisionally priced copper sales for the fourth quarters and years 2017 and 2016 (in millions, except per share amounts): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

At December 31, 2017, FCX had provisionally priced copper sales at its copper mining operations totaling 438 million pounds of copper (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling interests) recorded at an average of $3.28 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. FCX estimates that each $0.05 change in the price realized from the December 31, 2017, provisional price recorded would have an approximate $13 million effect on 2018 net income attributable to common stock. The LME spot copper price closed at $3.23 per pound on January 24, 2018. 

DEFERRED PROFITS

FCX defers recognizing profits on sales from its mining operations to Atlantic Copper and on 25 percent of PT-FI's sales to PT Smelting (PT-FI's 25 percent-owned Indonesian smelting unit) until final sales to third parties occur. Changes in these deferrals attributable to variability in intercompany volumes resulted in net reductions to net income attributable to common stock totaling $21 million in fourth-quarter 2017, $15 million in fourth-quarter 2016, $21 million for the year 2017 and $8 million for the year 2016. FCX's net deferred profits on its inventories at Atlantic Copper and PT Smelting to be recognized in future periods' net income attributable to common stock totaled $96 million at December 31, 2017. Quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices will result in variability in FCX's net deferred profits and quarterly earnings.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

FCX has organized its mining operations into four primary divisions – North America copper mines, South America mining, Indonesia mining and Molybdenum mines, and operating segments that meet certain thresholds are reportable segments. Separately disclosed in the following tables are FCX's reportable segments, which include the Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg (Indonesia Mining) copper mines, the Rod & Refining operations and Atlantic Copper Smelting & Refining. 

FCX’s reportable segments previously included U.S. Oil & Gas operations. During 2016, FCX completed the sales of its Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, onshore California and Haynesville oil and gas properties. As a result, beginning in 2017, the U.S. oil and gas operations no longer qualify as a reportable segment, and oil and gas results for all periods presented have been included in Corporate, Other & Eliminations in the following tables.

Intersegment sales between FCX’s business segments are based on terms similar to arms-length transactions with third parties at the time of the sale. Intersegment sales may not be reflective of the actual prices ultimately realized because of a variety of factors, including additional processing, the timing of sales to unaffiliated customers and transportation premiums. 

FCX allocates certain operating costs, expenses and capital expenditures to its operating divisions and individual segments. However, not all costs and expenses applicable to an operation are allocated. U.S. federal and state income taxes are recorded and managed at the corporate level (included in Corporate, Other & Eliminations), whereas foreign income taxes are recorded and managed at the applicable country level. In addition, most mining exploration and research activities are managed on a consolidated basis, and those costs along with some selling, general and administrative costs, are not allocated to the operating divisions or individual segments. Accordingly, the following segment information reflects management determinations that may not be indicative of what the actual financial performance of each operating division or segment would be if it was an independent entity.

PRODUCT REVENUES AND PRODUCTION COSTS

Unit net cash (credits) costs per pound of copper and molybdenum are measures intended to provide investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of FCX's mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for the respective operations. FCX uses this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by its mining operations. This information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures are presented by other metals mining companies, although FCX's measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

FCX presents gross profit per pound of copper in the following tables using both a “by-product” method and a “co-product” method. FCX uses the by-product method in its presentation of gross profit per pound of copper because (i) the majority of its revenues are copper revenues, (ii) it mines ore, which contains copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals, (iii) it is not possible to specifically assign all of FCX's costs to revenues from the copper, gold, molybdenum and other metals it produces and (iv) it is the method used by FCX's management and Board to monitor FCX's mining operations and to compare mining operations in certain industry publications. In the co-product method presentations, shared costs are allocated to the different products based on their relative revenue values, which will vary to the extent FCX's metals sales volumes and realized prices change.

FCX shows revenue adjustments for prior period open sales as a separate line item. Because these adjustments do not result from current period sales, these amounts have been reflected separately from revenues on current period sales. Noncash and other costs, which are removed from site production and delivery costs in the calculation of unit net cash (credits) costs, consist of items such as stock-based compensation costs, start-up costs, inventory adjustments, long-lived asset impairments, restructuring and/or unusual charges. As discussed above, gold, molybdenum and other metal revenues at copper mines are reflected as credits against site production and delivery costs in the by-product method. The following schedules are presentations under both the by-product and co-product methods together with reconciliations to amounts reported in FCX's consolidated financial statements.
