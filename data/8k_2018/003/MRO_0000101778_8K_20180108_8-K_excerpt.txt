Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

The information set forth in Item 7.01 below with respect to the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, of Marathon Oil Corporation (the "Corporation") is incorporated by reference herein.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform Legislation"), which made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law. The Corporation expects that certain aspects of the Tax Reform Legislation will positively impact the Corporation’s future after-tax earnings in the U.S., primarily due to the lower federal statutory tax rate. Set forth below is a discussion of certain provisions of the Tax Reform Legislation and our preliminary assessment of the effect of such provisions on the Corporation’s results of operations, cash flows and consolidated financial statements.

•Beginning January 1, 2018, the Corporation’s U.S. income will be taxed at a 21 percent federal corporate rate. Further, we are required to recognize the effect of this rate change on our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the period the tax rate change is enacted. We do not expect any material non-cash impact from this rate change, with adjustments to deferred tax balances offset by adjustments to deferred tax valuation allowances.

•The Tax Reform Legislation also repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) for tax years beginning January 1, 2018, and provides that existing AMT credit carryovers are refundable beginning in 2018. We have approximately $35 million of AMT credit carryovers that are expected to be fully refunded by 2022. 

•Further, the Tax Reform Legislation provides for a one-time “deemed repatriation” of accumulated foreign earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017. We do not expect to pay U.S. federal cash taxes on the deemed repatriation due to an accumulated deficit in foreign earnings for tax purposes. We do not expect that our future foreign earnings will be subject to U.S. federal income tax.

•In addition, the Tax Reform Legislation preserved deductibility of intangible drilling costs, and provides for 100 percent bonus depreciation on tangible property expenditures through 2022. The bonus depreciation percentage is phased down from 100 percent beginning in 2023 through 2026. We do not expect this to have a material impact to the Corporation.

The Tax Reform Legislation is a comprehensive bill containing several other provisions, such as limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation, that are not expected to have a material effect on the Corporation’s results. The ultimate impact of the Tax Reform Legislation may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by the Corporation, as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued. We will provide updated and additional information regarding impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation in connection with our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings release and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. 

In an unrelated tax matter, as disclosed most recently in our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2017, tax authorities in the United Kingdom have challenged the timing of deductibility for certain Brae area decommissioning costs. The dispute relates to the timing of our tax deduction rather than the general deductibility of decommissioning costs. 

During the fourth quarter 2017, we received an adverse ruling from the U.K. first-tier tax tribunal. We have applied for permission to appeal the ruling, but were required to pay the disputed tax amount and associated interest in order to pursue the appeal. 

Related accounting adjustments in fourth quarter 2017 are expected to result in a negative impact to cash flow from operations of approximately $110 million due to the prepayment discussed above. Additionally, we expect that the revisions to current and deferred tax liabilities will have no material adverse earnings impact on our consolidated results of operations.
