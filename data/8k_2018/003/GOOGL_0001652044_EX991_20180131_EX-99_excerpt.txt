Impact of the Tax Act

About non-GAAP financial measures

To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: operating income, excluding the impact of the Q2 2017 European Commission fine (EC fine); provision for income taxes, excluding the impact of the Tax Act; net income, excluding the impact of the Tax Act; effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the Tax Act; diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact of the Tax Act; free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and constant currency revenue growth. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities or our financial performance excluding one-time charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.

There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, such as the components of the expenses that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from our peer companies. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.

For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures,” "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow," and "Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues" included at the end of this release.

Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures

The following table presents non-GAAP financial measures, excluding the impact of the Tax Act (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts, unaudited):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following table presents non-GAAP financial measures, excluding the impact of the EC fine (in millions, unaudited):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-GAAP financial measures: Effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the Tax Act, is calculated by using provision for income taxes, excluding the impact of the Tax Act, divided by income before income taxes. Diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact of the Tax Act, is calculated by using net income, excluding the impact of the Tax Act, divided by total weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis for non-GAAP net income.

Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions, unaudited):

We provide free cash flow because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Free cash flow: We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.

Reconciliation from GAAP revenues to non-GAAP constant currency revenues (in millions, unaudited):

We provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues and growth because they facilitate the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are not indicative of our core operating results.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-GAAP constant currency revenues and growth: We define non-GAAP constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and we use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter bases. Non-GAAP constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging impact recognized in the current quarter. Constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current quarter non-GAAP constant currency revenues over prior period revenues, excluding any hedging impact recognized in the prior period.

(2) For purposes of segment reporting, SBC represents awards that we expect to settle in Alphabet stock.

(3) Reconciling items are related to timing differences of payments, as segment capital expenditures are on accrual basis while total capital expenditures shown on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are on cash basis, and other miscellaneous differences.
