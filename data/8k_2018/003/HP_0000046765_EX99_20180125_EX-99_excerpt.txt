 HELMERICH & PAYNE, INC. / 1437 SOUTH BOULDER AVENUE / TULSA, OKLAHOMA  

 January 25, 2018  

 HELMERICH & PAYNE, INC. ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS  

   ·    Quarterly U.S. Land revenue days (activity) increased by approximately 4% 

   ·    H&P’s spot pricing in the U.S. Land market continued to increase (approximately 4%) from the date of the fourth quarter results announcement (November 16, 2017) to January 25, 2018 

   ·    Quarterly U.S. Land adjusted average rig margin per day increased by approximately 11%(1) 

   ·    H&P’s U.S. Land contracted rig count increased by approximately 4% from 197 rigs at September 30, 2017 to 204 rigs at December 31, 2017, compared to a slight decline in the industry rig count(2) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (NYSE:HP) reported net income of $500 million or $4.55 per diluted share from operating revenues of $564 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Net income per diluted share includes $4.57 of after-tax gains comprised of select items(4), the most significant of which is a non-cash gain of approximately $501 million related to a reduction of H&P’s deferred income tax liability as a result of applying the new corporate tax rate enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act(5).   

 President and CEO John Lindsay commented, “Our team continued to deliver better-than-expected results. Setting aside the significant and favorable impact of the non-cash adjustment related to the new tax law, our operational results exceeded expectations in the first fiscal quarter. We are encouraged by an improving macro outlook for oil prices, and the prospect of an increasing level of rig activity that it portends.  

 “One of the primary factors driving rig pricing is the continued demand for high capacity super-spec rigs and the near full utilization of that portion of the U.S. fleet. A significant driver for super-spec rig demand last year was an average 15% increase in the length of laterals, and we expect this trend to continue. H&P has over 40% of the active super-spec rigs and with that portion of the industry fleet fully utilized we believe pricing should continue to improve. We also have a significant advantage for future growth as we have roughly half of the 200 to 250 upgradeable rigs available in the U.S. market today that could be readily upgraded to super-spec capacity.  

 “We are well equipped for the industry’s digital evolution. With our acquisitions of Motive Drilling Technologies and MagVAR we can provide additional value for our customers through improved wellbore quality and placement. Both companies are technology leaders in their respective space and the demand for their offerings is increasing as the importance of wellbore accuracy grows with longer laterals and tighter well spacing.   

 “Our people, performance, technology, reliability and uniform FlexRig fleet remain our strongest competitive advantages. Our most recent acquisitions add an attractive dimension to our strategic vision and further differentiate us from others in the market. Along with our scale and financial rigor, we are able to continue to provide superior value to customers and shareholders.”

 Operating Segment Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2018  

 U.S. Land Operations:  

 Segment operating income increased by $28.9 million to $24.7 million sequentially. For the third quarter in a row, the favorable change was primarily attributable to an increase in quarterly revenue days and a higher average rig margin per day. The segment’s Depreciation expense for the quarter includes non-cash charges of $7.2 million for abandonments of used drilling rig components related to rig upgrades, compared to similar non-cash charges of $15.4 million during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017.   

 The number of quarterly revenue days increased sequentially by approximately 4%. Adjusted average rig revenue per day increased by $483 to $22,167(1) as pricing continued to improve throughout the quarter. The average rig expense per day decreased sequentially by $359 to $13,546; the decrease in the average was mostly attributable to lower than anticipated self-insurance expenses. The corresponding adjusted average rig margin per day increased sequentially by $842 to $8,621(1).  

 Offshore Operations:  

 Segment operating income increased by $3.7 million to $8.7 million sequentially primarily as a result of higher management contract contributions and slightly higher average rig margins during the quarter. Management contracts on customer-owned platform rigs contributed approximately $6.5 million to the segment’s operating income, compared to approximately $2.5 million during the prior quarter. The number of quarterly revenue days on H&P-owned platform rigs decreased sequentially by approximately 6%, and the average rig margin per day increased sequentially by $287 to $12,375.   

 International Land Operations:  

 The segment had operating income this quarter as compared to an operating loss during the previous quarter. The $5.5 million sequential increase in operating income was primarily attributable to a higher number of revenue days during the quarter. Revenue days increased during the quarter by 23% to 1,587. The average rig margin per day decreased by $1,035 to $11,351. Both the first fiscal quarter and the prior quarter benefited from favorable adjustments that are not expected to recur going forward.   

 Operational Outlook for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2018  

 U.S. Land Operations:  

   ·    Quarterly revenue days expected to increase by approximately 1% to 2% sequentially (representing a 3% to 4% increase in the average number of active rigs given the lower number of calendar days during the second fiscal quarter) 

   ·    Average rig revenue per day expected to be roughly flat to slightly up as compared to the first fiscal quarter (excluding any impact from early termination revenue) 

   ·    Average rig expense per day expected to be roughly $13,900 

 Offshore Operations:  

   ·    Quarterly revenue days expected to decrease by approximately 2% sequentially (as a result of the lower number of calendar days during the second fiscal quarter) 

   ·    Average rig margin per day expected to be approximately $11,500 

   ·    Management contracts expected to generate approximately $4 million in operating income 

 International Land Operations:  

   ·    Quarterly revenue days expected to decrease by approximately 4% sequentially (representing a 2% decline in the average number of active rigs given the lower number of calendar days during the second fiscal quarter) 

   ·    Average rig margin per day expected to be roughly $8,000 

 Other Estimates for Fiscal 2018  

   ·    Given the continued improvement in market conditions and corresponding opportunities, fiscal 2018 capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $350 million, up from our original estimate of $250 to $300 million. 

   ·    The estimate for general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 is now approximately $180 million.

 Segment operating income for all segments is a non-GAAP financial measure of the Company’s performance, as it excludes general and administrative expenses, corporate depreciation, income from asset sales and other corporate income and expense. The Company considers segment operating income to be an important supplemental measure of operating performance for presenting trends in the Company’s core businesses. This measure is used by the Company to facilitate period-to-period comparisons in operating performance of the Company’s reportable segments in the aggregate by eliminating items that affect comparability between periods. The Company believes that segment operating income is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the segments and the Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers. Additionally, it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons. However, segment operating income has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income or loss, a performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as it excludes certain costs that may affect the Company’s operating performance in future periods.  

 The following table reconciles operating income per the information above to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands).
