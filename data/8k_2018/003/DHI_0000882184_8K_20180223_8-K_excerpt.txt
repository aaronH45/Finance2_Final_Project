Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, U.S. Bank National Association, a national banking association, as a buyer, and as administrative agent, (“U.S. Bank” or “Buyer” or “Administrative Agent”) and other buyers listed as a buyer (collectively, the "Buyers") hereto entered into a Fifth Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement (the “Fifth Amendment”). The Seller, the Buyers, and the Administrative Agent are parties to a Second Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement dated as of February 27, 2015, a First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement dated as of February 26, 2016, a Second Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement dated as of June 24, 2016, a Third Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement dated as of September 23, 2016, and a Fourth Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement dated as of February 24, 2017 (collectively, the “Amended Repurchase Facility”).

The Amended Repurchase Facility provides financing and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage transfers eligible loans to Buyers against the transfer of funds by Buyers (thereby becoming purchased loans). The purchase transactions are based on the terms and conditions in the Amended Repurchase Facility and the ancillary or operative agreements attached thereto or referred to therein, including the Amended and Restated Custody Agreement, dated March 1, 2013, by and between DHI Mortgage and U.S. Bank.

The primary change covered by the Fifth Amendment is to extend the maturity date of the facility by 364 days; with secondary benefits including higher advance rates on collateral and lower pricing.

The Fifth Amendment changes the term of the Amended Repurchase Facility through the earlier of (i) February 22, 2019, or (ii) the date when the Buyers’ commitments are terminated pursuant to the Amended Repurchase Facility, by order of any governmental authority or by operation of law.
