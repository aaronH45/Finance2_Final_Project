 Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

On February 15, 2018, Xerox Corporation (the “Company” or “Xerox”), as borrower, entered into an Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”) with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”) and the lenders party thereto from time to time. The Amendment amended the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2017 (the “Credit Agreement”), by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto from time to time, the Administrative Agent and other parties named therein.  

As previously announced by the Company, on January 31, 2018, the Company and FujiFilm Holdings Corporation (“Fujifilm”) entered into definitive agreements to combine Xerox and their longstanding Fuji Xerox joint venture. Under the terms of the agreements, (i) Xerox shareholders will receive a $2.5 billion special cash dividend and own 49.9% of the combined company, on a fully diluted basis, at closing and (ii) Fujifilm will own 50.1% of the combined company, on a fully diluted basis, at closing (collectively, the “Transactions”). The Amendment, among other things, modifies the “change of control” provisions of the Credit Agreement to permit the consummation of the Transactions.  

Certain of the lenders under the Credit Agreement and their respective affiliates perform various financial advisory, investment banking and commercial banking services from time to time for the Company and its subsidiaries, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expense reimbursement.  

The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated in this Item 1.01 by reference.
