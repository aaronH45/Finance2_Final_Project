Item 2.02.Results of Operations and Financial Condition 

The information set forth in Item 7.01 below with respect to the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, of Pioneer Natural Resources Company and its subsidiaries (“Pioneer” or the “Company”) is incorporated by reference herein.

Item 7.01.

Regulation FD Disclosure

On December 22, 2017, the United States ("U.S.") enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Legislation”), which made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law. The Company expects that certain aspects of these changes will positively impact its future after-tax earnings primarily due to the lower federal statutory tax rate. Set forth below is a discussion of certain provisions of the Tax Reform Legislation and the Company’s preliminary assessment of the impact of such provisions on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and balance sheet.

•Beginning January 1, 2018, Pioneer's income will be taxed at a 21 percent federal corporate rate. The Company is required to recognize the effect of this rate change on its deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period the tax rate change is enacted. The Company currently expects this rate change will result in a noncash decrease to the Company's income tax provision (shown on its Consolidated Statements of Operations) of approximately $600 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, with a corresponding reduction in the Company's deferred income tax liability (shown on its Consolidated Balance Sheets).

•The Tax Reform Legislation also repealed corporate alternative minimum tax ("AMT") for tax years beginning January 1, 2018, and provides that existing AMT credit carryovers are refundable beginning in 2018. The Company has approximately $20 million of AMT credit carryovers that are expected to be fully refunded by 2022.

•In addition, the Tax Reform Legislation preserves deductibility of intangible drilling costs and provides for 100 percent bonus depreciation on personal tangible property expenditures through 2022. The bonus depreciation percentage is phased down from 100 percent beginning in 2023 through 2026.

The Tax Reform Legislation is a comprehensive bill containing other provisions, such as limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation, that are not expected to materially affect Pioneer. The ultimate impact of the Tax Reform Legislation may differ from the Company's estimates due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made by Pioneer as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued. The Company will provide updated and additional information regarding impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation in connection with its fourth quarter 2017 earnings release and its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
