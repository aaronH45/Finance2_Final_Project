"2017 was a year of rapid transformation for Alexion as we continued to advance our global leadership in rare diseases and position Alexion for the future. I am proud of our accomplishments and performance in 2017, which include strengthening the leadership team and Board of Directors, achieving regulatory 

approvals for Soliris for the treatment of patients with gMG in the US, Europe and Japan, completing enrollment in the ALXN1210 PNH Phase 3 trials and the Soliris NMOSD Phase 3 trial, strengthening our global patent portfolio for Soliris and continuing to achieve double-digit revenue and volume growth," said Ludwig Hantson, Chief Executive Officer of Alexion.

Research and Development

Complement Portfolio Updates

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Soliris (eculizumab)- Relapsing Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD): Enrollment is complete in the PREVENT study, a single, multinational, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial of Soliris in patients with NMOSD. Alexion expects to report data in mid-2018.

•ALXN1210- Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH): Enrollment is complete in a Phase 3 trial comparing ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks to Soliris in complement inhibitor treatment-naive patients with PNH and in a Phase 3 PNH Switch study of ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks compared to patients currently treated with Soliris. Alexion expects to report data from these studies in the second quarter of 2018. 

•ALXN1210- Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS): Enrollment and dosing are ongoing in a Phase 3 trial with ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks in complement inhibitor treatment-naive adolescent and adult patients with aHUS. Enrollment is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2018 and Alexion expects to report data from this study in the fourth 

quarter of 2018. Enrollment and dosing are also ongoing in a Phase 3 trial of ALXN1210 in pediatric patients with aHUS.

•ALXN1210- Subcutaneous: Alexion plans to initiate in late 2018 a single, PK-based Phase 3 study of ALXN1210 delivered subcutaneously once per week to support registration in PNH and aHUS. In December 2017, Alexion entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. that enables the Company to use Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug-delivery technology in the development of subcutaneous formulations for its portfolio of products, including a next-generation subcutaneous formulation of ALXN1210 to potentially further extend the dosing interval to once every two weeks or once per month.

2018 Financial Guidance 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2018 financial guidance assumes the following:

•A foreign currency benefit, net of hedging activities, of $45 million to $55 million 

•Unfavorable Soliris revenue impact of $90 million to $110 million from ALXN1210 and other clinical trial recruitment versus prior year

•GAAP effective tax rate of 15 to 17 percent; non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16 to 18 percent (both inclusive of Alexion's provisional assessment of the impact of U.S. tax reform)

Alexion’s financial guidance is based on current foreign exchange rates net of hedging activities and does not include the effect of business combinations, license and collaboration agreements, asset acquisitions, intangible asset impairments, changes in fair value of contingent consideration or restructuring and related activity outside of the previously announced activities that may occur after the day prior to the date of this press release.

Alexion expects to incur additional restructuring and related expenses of approximately $30 million to $70 million related to the 2017 restructuring activities. As the Company continues to execute its strategic business plan and global footprint, it may incur restructuring expenses in 2018 that are materially different from the current estimate.

(1) In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new income tax standard that eliminates the exception for an intra-entity asset transfer other than inventory. We elected to early adopt this standard in the first quarter 2017. As a result of the adoption, we recorded an $18.8 million decrease in retained earnings, primarily resulting from the elimination of previously recorded prepaid tax assets.
