Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. 

On February 21, 2018, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware an amendment to its Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Amendment”) to change the legal name of the Company from The Priceline Group Inc. to Booking Holdings Inc. (the “Name Change”), and afterwards filed a restatement of the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Restated Certificate”), each effective as of February 21, 2018. The Company’s board of directors also has adopted amended and restated By-Laws of the Company (“Amended By-Laws”) reflecting the name change, effective on February 21, 2018. Other than the Name Change, there were no changes to the Company’s certificate of incorporation or by-laws. Copies of the Certificate of Amendment and the Restated Certificate, as filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and the Amended By-Laws, are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1, Exhibit 3.2 and Exhibit 3.3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. 

Effective February 27, 2018, the Company’s common stock will trade under the ticker symbol BKNG. The Name Change resulted in a change to the CUSIP number for the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock offered on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The new CUSIP number for such common stock is 09857L108. Outstanding stock certificates for shares of the Company continue to be valid and need not be exchanged. 

Effective on or about March 15, 2018, the Name Change will result in changes to the ticker symbols and CUSIP numbers for the Company’s debt listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “Public Debt”). As of such date, the Company’s Public Debt will trade under the following ticker symbols and CUSIP numbers: (i) 2.15% Senior Notes Due 2022 - BKNG22 and 09857LAA6, (ii) 0.800% Senior Notes Due 2022 - BKNG22A and 09857LAB4, (iii) 2.375% Senior Notes Due 2024 - BKNG24 and 09857LAC2 and (iv) 1.800% Senior Notes Due 2027 - BKNG27 and 09857LAD0.

In connection with the Name Change, the Company launched a new corporate website: www.bookingholdings.com.
