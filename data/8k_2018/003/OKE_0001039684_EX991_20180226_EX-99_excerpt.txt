BUSINESS-SEGMENT RESULTS: Key financial and operating statistics are listed on page 16 in the tables. Natural Gas Liquids Segment The natural gas liquids segment’s fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased 22 and 7 percent, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2016. Volume growth across ONEOK’s system from increased supply and increased ethane recovery contributed to higher NGL volumes gathered during the fourth quarter and full year 2017, compared with 2016. Fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 NGLs fractionated increased 18 percent and 6 percent respectively, compared with the same periods in 2016.  

 ONEOK Announces Higher Fourth-quarter and Full-year 2017 Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA Feb. 26, 2018 Page 5 -more- As total NGL production increased in 2017, ethane rejection levels on ONEOK’s system decreased to an average of more than 150,000 bpd in 2017, compared with approximately 175,000 bpd in 2016. ONEOK expects ethane rejection levels on its system to decrease to approximately 70,000 bpd by the end of 2018 as world-scale petrochemical facilities come online and NGL exporters increase volumes. Three Months Ended Years Ended December 31, December 31, Natural Gas Liquids Segment 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Millions of dollars) Adjusted EBITDA $ 309.4 $ 253.6 $ 1,154.9 $ 1,079.6 Capital expenditures $ 54.5 $ 20.4 $ 114.3 $ 105.9 The increase in fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA, compared with the fourth quarter 2016, primarily reflects: • A $51.7 million increase in exchange services due to increased supply in the STACK and SCOOP areas and the Williston Basin from recently connected natural gas processing plants, increased ethane recovery in the STACK and SCOOP areas, and the impact of weather in December 2016, offset partially by lower volumes in the Granite Wash and Barnett Shale; and • An $11.7 million increase in optimization and marketing due primarily to higher optimization volumes and wider location price differentials, offset partially by narrower product price differentials; offset partially by • A $12.6 million increase in operating costs due primarily to the timing of routine maintenance projects and higher labor and employee-related costs. The increase in adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017, compared with 2016, primarily reflects: • An $81.5 million increase in exchange services due primarily to increased supply and ethane recovery volumes in the Williston Basin, the STACK and SCOOP areas and the Powder River Basin; offset partially by lower volumes in the Granite Wash and Barnett Shale, and reduced volumes related to Hurricane Harvey; • A $13.5 million increase in optimization and marketing due primarily to higher optimization volumes and wider location price differentials; and • A $5.4 million increase in equity in net earnings from investments due primarily to higher volumes delivered to the Overland Pass Pipeline from the Bakken NGL Pipeline and higher volumes and increased ethane recovery from plants connected to the Overland Pass Pipeline; offset partially by  

 ONEOK Announces Higher Fourth-quarter and Full-year 2017 Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA Feb. 26, 2018 Page 6 -more- • A $32.2 million increase in operating costs due primarily to the timing of routine maintenance projects, higher property taxes, higher labor and employee-related costs and additional operating costs related to Hurricane Harvey. Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Segment The natural gas gathering and processing segment’s fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased 14 and 16 percent, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2016. Volume growth due to increased drilling activity, enhanced producer efficiencies and the completion of growth projects contributed to increases in natural gas volumes processed of 20 percent and 9 percent in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2016. Volume growth for the full year 2017 was offset partially by natural production declines on existing wells and the impact of severe winter weather in the first quarter 2017. This segment also continues to benefit from higher fee-based earnings, with an average fee rate of 86 cents per MMBtu in 2017, compared with 76 cents per MMBtu in 2016, a 13 percent increase. Three Months Ended Years Ended December 31, December 31, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Segment 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Millions of dollars) Adjusted EBITDA $ 144.3 $ 126.6 $ 518.5 $ 446.8 Capital expenditures $ 98.5 $ 84.7 $ 284.2 $ 410.5 Fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased, compared with the fourth quarter 2016, which primarily reflects: • A $37.8 million increase due primarily to natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas, offset partially by natural production declines; offset partially by • An $8.0 million decrease due to contract settlements in 2016; • A $7.2 million increase in operating costs due primarily to higher materials and supplies expenses, and increased employee-related costs; and • A $4.4 million decrease due primarily to lower realized natural gas and condensate prices.

 ONEOK Announces Higher Fourth-quarter and Full-year 2017 Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA Feb. 26, 2018 Page 9 -more- • Dividend coverage ratio is defined as ONEOK’s distributable cash flow to ONEOK shareholders divided by the dividends paid for the period. These non-GAAP financial measures described above are useful to investors because they, and similar measures, are used by many companies in the industry as a measure of financial performance and are commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate our financial performance and to compare our financial performance with the performance of other companies within our industry. Adjusted EBITDA, ONEOK distributable cash flow and coverage ratio should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, these calculations may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of net income to adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and coverage ratio are included in the tables. ONEOK, Inc.
