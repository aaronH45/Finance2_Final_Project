        "   Stacking. An 'Idle' rig is primarily between contracts, readily available for operations, and operating costs are typically at or near normal levels. A 'Stacked' rig, on the other hand, is primarily manned by a reduced crew or unmanned and typically has reduced operating costs and is (i) preparing for an extended period of inactivity, (ii) expected to continue to be inactive for an extended period, or (iii) completing a period of extended inactivity. However, stacked rigs will continue to incur operating costs at or above normal operating costs for approximately 30 days following initiation of stacking."
