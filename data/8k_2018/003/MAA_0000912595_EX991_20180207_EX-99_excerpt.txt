CAPITAL MARKETS UPDATE 2 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This presentation contains forward - looking statements within the meaning of Section 27 A of the Securities Act of 1933 , as amended, as Section 21 E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended . These forward - looking statements, which are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which MAA operates and beliefs of and assumptions made by MAA management, involve uncertainties that could significantly affect the financial results of MAA . Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward - looking statements, which are not historical in nature . In this presentation, forward - looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about forecasted 2018 operating results, expected benefits and synergies from the merger with Post Properties, Inc . and the timing of those benefits and synergies, the anticipated value of current development projects, estimated costs of property development, the anticipated timing of completion of current development projects and the stabilization of such projects, MAA’s future development projects, the anticipated scope of MAA’s future redevelopment activities and projected incremental rent growth, and other information that is not historical . All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that MAA anticipates or expects will occur in the future are forward - looking statements . These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict . Although MAA believes the expectations reflected in any forward - looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, MAA can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved, and therefore actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward - looking statements . Some of the factors that may affect outcomes and results include, but are not limited to : inability to generate sufficient cash flows due to market conditions, changes in supply and/or demand, competition, uninsured losses, changes in tax and housing laws, or other factors ; exposure as a multifamily - focused REIT to risks inherent in investments in a single industry and sector ; adverse changes in real estate markets ; failure of new acquisitions to achieve anticipated results or be efficiently integrated ; failure of development communities to be completed, if at all, within budget and on a timely basis or to lease - up as anticipated ; unexpected capital needs ; changes in operating costs, including real estate taxes, utilities and insurance costs ; losses from catastrophes in excess of our insurance coverage ; level and volatility of interest or capitalization rates or capital market conditions ; the effect of any rating agency actions ; inability to attract and retain qualified personnel ; cyberliability or potential liability for breaches of our privacy or information security systems ; adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes ; litigation and compliance costs associated with laws requiring access for disabled persons ; risks associated with the Post Properties, Inc . merger, including the integration of MAA’s and Post Properties, Inc . ’s businesses and achieving expected revenue synergies and/or cost savings as a result of the merger ; risks associated with unexpected costs or unexpected liabilities that may arise from the Post Properties, Inc . merger ; and those additional risks and factors discussed in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by MAA from time to time, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in its most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10 - K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10 - Q . MAA undertakes no duty to update any forward - looking statements appearing in this presentation . REGULATION G This presentation contains certain non - GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended . MAA’s definitions of these non - GAAP financial measures, among other terms, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, can be found in the accompanying Appendix and under the “Financial Results” navigation tab on the “For Investors” page of MAA’s website at www . maac . com .

DEFINITIONS OF NON - GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES CAPITAL MARKETS UPDATE 30 Adjusted EBITDA For purposes of calculations in this release, Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, or Adjusted EBITDA, is composed of EBITDA adjusted for net gain or loss on asset sales and insurance and other settlement procee ds, and gain or loss on debt extinguishment. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure of performance from core operations because Adjusted EBITDA does not include various income and expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net inc ome available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of financial performance. MAA's computation of Adjusted EBITDA may diff er from the methodology utilized by other companies to calculate Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) AFFO is composed of FFO less recurring capital expenditures. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers AFFO to be an important measur e of performance from operations because AFFO measures the ability to control revenues, expenses and recurring capital expenditures. Combined Adjusted Same Store NOI Combined Adjusted Same Store NOI represents total operating revenues less total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation, for all properties classified within the Combined Adjusted Same Store Portfolio during the period. Combined Adj ust ed Same Store NOI should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders. MAA believes Combined Adjusted Same Store NOI is a helpful tool in evaluating the operating performance within MAA's markets because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related to property operating performance .  

DEFINITIONS OF NON - GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES CAPITAL MARKETS UPDATE 31 EBITDA For purposes of calculations in this release, Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, or EBITDA, i s composed of net income plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and income taxes. As an owner and operator of r eal estate, MAA considers EBITDA to be an important measure of performance from core operations because EBITDA does not include various expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of financial performance. Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) FAD is composed of FFO less total capital expenditures, excluding development spending and property acquisitions. FAD should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders. As an owner and operator of real estate , MAA considers FAD to be an important measure of performance from core operations because FAD measures the ability to control revenues, expenses and total capital expenditures.  

DEFINITIONS OF NON - GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES CAPITAL MARKETS UPDATE 32 Funds From Operations (FFO) FFO represents net income available for MAA common shareholders (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) excluding extraordinary items, asset impairment, gains or losses on disposition of real estat e a ssets, plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. Because noncontrolling interest is added back, FFO, when used in this document, represents FFO attributable to the Company. While MAA's definition of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Rea l Estate Investment Trusts' definition, it may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, acc ord ingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. MAA believes that FFO is helpful in understanding operating performance in that FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets. MAA believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does no t diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Gross Assets Gross Assets represents Total assets plus Accumulated depreciation, the accumulated depreciation for corporate properties, which is included in Corporate property, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and accumulated depreciation for Assets held for sa le, which is included in Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. MAA believes that Gross Assets can be used as a helpful tool in evaluating its balance sheet positions. MAA believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate a sse ts is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as h ist orical cost depreciation implies.  

DEFINITIONS OF NON - GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES CAPITAL MARKETS UPDATE 33 Gross Real Estate Assets Gross Real Estate Assets represents Real estate assets, net plus Accumulated depreciation, the accumulated depreciation for corporate properties, which is included in Corporate property, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and accumulated depreciation for Assets held for sale, which is included in Assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets plus Cash an d cash equivalents plus 1031(b) exchange proceeds included in Restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. MAA believes that Gross Real Estate Assets can be used as a helpful tool in evaluating its balance sheet positions. MAA believes that GAA P historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, who se value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Net Debt Net Debt represents Unsecured notes payable and Secured notes payable less Cash and cash equivalents and 1031(b) proceeds included in Restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. MAA believes Net Debt is a helpful tool in evaluating its de bt position. Net Operating Income (NOI) Net operating income represents total operating revenues less total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation, for all properties held during the period, regardless of their status as held for sale. NOI should not be considered as an alternativ e t o Net income available for MAA common shareholders. MAA believes NOI by market is a helpful tool in evaluating the operating performance within MAA's markets because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related to property operating performance.  

DEFINITIONS OF NON - GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES CAPITAL MARKETS UPDATE 34 Recurring Adjusted EBITDA Recurring Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain items that are not considered part of MAA's core business operations such as acquisition and merger and integration expenses. MAA believes Recurring Adjusted EBIT DA is an important performance measure as it adjusts for certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance. Recurring Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. MAA's computation of Recurring Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies to calculate Recurring Adjusted EBITDA. Average Effective Rent per Unit Average effective rent per unit represents the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occupied units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units, divided by the total number of units. Leasing concessions repre sen t discounts to the current market rate. MAA believes average effective rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pric ing . It does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit. Average Physical Occupancy Average physical occupancy represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the quarter. Combined Adjusted Same Store Portfolio Combined Adjusted Same Store Portfolio represents the MAA Same Store Portfolio and the Post Adjusted Same Store Portfolio considered as a single portfolio, as if the Post Adjusted Same Store Portfolio was owned by MAA during all periods presented. Fo r comparability purposes, certain adjustments have been made to the prior year Post Adjusted Same Store Portfolio. See the definition of the Post Adjusted Same Store Portfolio for more details.  

DEFINITIONS OF NON - GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES CAPITAL MARKETS UPDATE 35 Development Portfolio Communities remain identified as development until certificates of occupancy are obtained for all units under development. Once all units are delivered and available for occupancy, the community moves into the Lease - up Portfolio. Lease - up Portfolio New acquisitions acquired during lease - up and newly developed communities remain in the Lease - up Portfolio until stabilized. Non - Same Store Portfolio Non - Same Store Portfolio includes recent acquisitions, communities that have been identified for disposition, and communities that have undergone a significant casualty loss. MAA Same Store Portfolio MAA reviews its Same Store Portfolio at the beginning of each calendar year, or as significant transactions warrant. Communities are generally added into the MAA Same Store Portfolio if they were owned and stabilized at the beginning of the previous year. Communities that have been approved by MAA's Board of Directors for disposition are excluded from the MAA Same Store Portfoli o. Communities that have undergone a significant casualty loss are also excluded from the MAA Same Store Portfolio. Within the MAA Same Store Portfolio communities are designated as operating in Large or Secondary Markets: Large Market Same Store communities are generally those communities in markets with a population of at least one million and at least 1% of the total public multifamily REIT units. Secondary Market Same Store communities are generally those communities in markets with either a population less than one million or less than 1% of the total public multifamily REIT units, or both.  

DEFINITIONS OF NON - GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES CAPITAL MARKETS UPDATE 36 Post Adjusted Same Store Portfolio Post Adjusted Same Store Portfolio represents the Post Properties same store portfolio that would have been in effect had the properties been owned by MAA since January 1, 2016. Prior year results have been adjusted for consistency with MAA accounting policies and year over year comparisons. The primary adjustments include moving corporate property management expenses, exterior paint costs and IT operating systems costs out of property expenses. Because these properties have only been owned by MAA since December 1, 2016, they were not included in the MAA Same Store Portfolio for periods prior to January 2018. See MA A Same Store Portfolio for more information regarding inclusion. These properties have been identified in certain tables to pr ovi de Combined Adjusted Same Store results as if the properties had been owned by MAA in prior periods. These properties became eligible to join the MAA Same Store portfolio in January 2018. Stabilized Communities Communities are considered stabilized after achieving at least 90% occupancy for 90 days. Total Market Capitalization Total Market Capitalization equals the number of shares of common stock plus units not held by MAA at period end multiplied by the closing stock price at period end, plus total debt outstanding. Unencumbered NOI Unencumbered NOI represents NOI generated by our unencumbered assets (as defined in MAALP's bond covenants).
