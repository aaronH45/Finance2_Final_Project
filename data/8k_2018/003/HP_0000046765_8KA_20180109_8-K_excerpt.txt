ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE

The presentation is being corrected to state the total rig fleet at 396 rigs in the sixth slide, as well as other minor modifications in other slides. The Company is furnishing the entire slide deck, including the modified slides, as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K/A.
