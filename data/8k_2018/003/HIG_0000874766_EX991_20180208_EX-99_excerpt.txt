HARTFORD, Conn., Feb. 8, 2018 – The Hartford (NYSE: HIG) reported a fourth quarter 2017 net loss of $3.7 billion compared with a net loss of $81 million in fourth quarter 2016. The fourth quarter 2017 net loss resulted from a $3.1 billion loss on discontinued operations related to the previously-announced agreement to sell Talcott Resolution, the company's life and annuity run-off business, and an $877 million charge due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate that was effective Jan. 1, 2018. Fourth quarter 2017 net loss per share was $10.37 compared with a net loss per share of $0.22 in fourth quarter 2016.

Fourth quarter 2017 core earnings were $293 million, essentially flat compared with $294 million in fourth quarter 2016, as favorable prior accident year development (PYD) compared with unfavorable PYD in fourth quarter 2016, improved current accident year Personal Lines results before catastrophes and higher Group Benefits and Mutual Funds core earnings offset significantly higher current accident year catastrophe losses and lower current accident year Commercial Lines results before catastrophes. Current accident year catastrophe losses rose from $61 million, before tax ($40 million, after tax), in fourth quarter 2016 to $179 million, before tax ($116 million, after tax) in fourth quarter 2017. Core earnings per diluted share were $0.81, a 5% increase from $0.77 per diluted share in fourth quarter 2016 due to the 5% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the period.

“In the face of record catastrophe losses for the industry, 2017 was an outstanding year at The Hartford, with several major accomplishments and very strong business results,” said The Hartford’s Chairman and CEO Christopher Swift. "These accomplishments included the announcement to sell Talcott Resolution and the acquisition of Aetna’s U.S. group life and disability business, along with improved profitability in personal auto, excellent results from Group Benefits and Mutual Funds and very good investment returns. Although we posted a net loss for the year due to our strategic actions and the impact of U.S. corporate tax reform, full year core earnings per diluted share were up 19 percent.” 

The Hartford’s President Doug Elliot said, “Our P&C results were very strong in 2017, and we are pleased with our performance in a year with record catastrophes affecting the industry, reflecting the benefit of underwriting and pricing actions we have taken over the last several years. Personal Lines' turnaround continued, with the auto line returning to underwriting profitability on an underlying basis and additional progress underway in 2018. In Commercial Lines, Small Commercial continued its track record of strong margins and top line growth. Group Benefits delivered premium growth and excellent earnings in 2017, and we are intently focused on the integration in order to utilize expanded capabilities across the platform.” 

Swift concluded, “I am proud of our employees and all that they achieved over the past year. Our goals and strategy remain unchanged going forward: generate sustainable long-term profitable growth by investing in our businesses to be a broader and deeper risk player and develop the talent, systems, data and analytical tools and capabilities that make us a more customer-centric company. In 2018, we expect stronger earnings growth and a much higher return on equity, and I am confident that we will build on our strengths and add to our successes to create long-term shareholder value.”

The full year 2017 net loss of $3.1 billion included a $2.9 billion loss on discontinued operations, an $877 million charge due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate, and a second quarter 2017 $488 million, after tax, pension settlement charge. Core earnings, which do not include these three items, were $1.0 billion, an 11% increase from 2016. 

Core earnings increased in 2017 despite a significant increase in catastrophe losses due to a change to favorable PYD in 2017 from unfavorable PYD in 2016. Current accident year catastrophe losses, before tax, increased from $416 million, before tax, in 2016 to $836 million, before tax, in 2017 while PYD changed from unfavorable PYD of $457 million, before tax, in 2016 to favorable PYD of $41 million, before tax, in 2017. The unfavorable PYD in 2016 included $268 million, before tax ($174 million, after tax), for asbestos and environmental (A&E) liabilities and $160 million, before tax ($104 million, after tax), for personal auto liability. In 2017, as a result of the company's aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement covering A&E exposures, there was no charge for unfavorable PYD on A&E. In addition, there was no net unfavorable PYD on personal auto liability in 2017. Excluding current accident year catastrophes and PYD, core earnings were up 3% in 2017 due to improved personal auto underwriting results and higher Mutual Funds and Group Benefits core earnings, largely offset by deterioration in Commercial Lines underwriting margins.

2018 KEY BUSINESS METRICS OUTLOOK 

The Hartford also announced its outlook for several 2018 key business metrics. The company does not provide an outlook for consolidated net income or core earnings. The key business metrics shown below are management estimates based on business, competitive, capital market, catastrophe and other assumptions. The metrics are subject to change for many reasons, including unusual or unpredictable items such as weather or catastrophe losses, change in loss frequency and severity, regulatory changes or assessments, PYD, capital markets or investment results and other factors that are not within management's control. The company has frequently experienced unusual or unpredictable changes in revenues, expenses or other items that were not anticipated in prior outlooks. The table below presents the 2018 key business metrics compared with 2017 actual results, including the impact of higher catastrophe losses in 2017.

2018 Key Business Metrics Outlook

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[1] 2018 combined ratio metrics include an estimated consolidated P&C current accident year catastrophe loss ratio of 3.6 points, comprised of 2.6 points in Commercial Lines and 5.6 points in Personal Lines; actual 2018 catastrophes are likely to be different and will fluctuate quarterly due to seasonal variations

[2] Commercial Lines combined ratio range includes an estimated 0.5 points for accretion of discount on workers' compensation reserves as PYD. For Commercial Lines, the estimated underlying combined ratio range is 90.0 to 92.5. For Personal Lines, which does not include any estimated PYD, the estimated underlying combined ratio range is 90.5 to 92.5 

[3] Includes an estimated 6% annualized yield on limited partnerships and other alternative investments (LPs) compared with 11% in 2017; actual results are likely to be different and will fluctuate quarterly

[4] 2018 outlook includes amortization of intangibles of $45 million to $50 million, after tax, and an estimated Group Benefits core earnings range of $310 million to $330 million

Subject to the cautionary language in the immediately preceding paragraph, The Hartford's business metrics for 2018 reflect improved Commercial Lines and Personal Lines combined ratios due to lower projected catastrophe losses and expected improvement in underlying combined ratios at both segments. The Commercial Lines underlying 2018 combined ratio is projected to be in a range of 90.0 to 92.5 compared with 92.0 in 2017 driven by higher expected pricing in certain product lines and continued disciplined underwriting and risk selection. The Personal Lines underlying 2018 combined ratio is anticipated to improve to a range of 90.5 to 92.5 from 93.0 in 2017 largely due to expected continued improvement in auto results, offset in part by higher marketing costs. 

3

Group Benefits 2018 net income is projected to be in a range of $275 million to $295 million, which includes integration and transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business. This compares with $294 million in 2017, which included a $52 million tax benefit from the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate and strong LP returns. Group Benefits core earnings, which do not include integration and transaction costs, are expected to increase to a range of $310 million to $330 million in 2018, including $45 million to $50 million, after tax, of amortization of intangibles due to the acquisition. This compares with 2017 core earnings of $234 million, with the increase largely due to the acquisition.

P&C net investment income is expected to decline modestly in 2018 compared with 2017 principally due to an estimated 6% annualized investment yield on LPs compared with a much higher yield of 11% in 2017.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[1]The Hartford defines increases or decreases greater than or equal to 200%, or changes from a net gain to a net loss position, or vice versa, as "NM" or not meaningful 

[2]Includes dilutive potential common shares

[3]For the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, weighted average shares outstanding used in calculating net loss per share excludes the effect of dilutive securities of 6.8 million shares. The calculation of core earnings per share includes the effect of dilutive securities in all periods presented. In periods where a net loss before discontinued operations or a core loss is recognized, inclusion of incremental dilution is antidilutive

[4] Return on equity (ROE) calculated based on last 12-months net income and core earnings, respectively; for ROE - Net Income, the denominator is stockholders’ equity including accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI); for ROE - Core Earnings, the denominator is stockholders’ equity excluding AOCI

Fourth quarter 2017 consolidated net investment income declined 4% to $394 million, before tax, from $412 million, before tax, in fourth quarter 2016 primarily as a result of lower, but still strong, investment income on LPs due to lower returns on real estate investments in 2017. Investment income from LPs was $29 million, before tax ($18 million, after tax), in fourth quarter 2017 for an annualized investment yield of 7.3%, compared with $46 million, before tax ($30 million, after tax), for an annualized investment yield of 12.2%, in fourth quarter 2016. The credit performance of the investment portfolio continues to be very strong, with net impairment losses, including mortgage loan valuation allowances, of $5 million, before tax, down slightly from $7 million, before tax, in fourth quarter 2016.

The annualized investment yield, excluding LPs, was 3.7% in fourth quarter 2017 down from 4.0% in fourth quarter 2016 due to a lower level of favorable non-routine investment items in 2017 and the impact on the yield due to the Aetna group benefits investment portfolio being recorded at market yields, as required by purchase accounting. 

During fourth quarter 2017, the company repurchased 0.9 million common shares for approximately $53 million. As a result of the decision to acquire Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business, the company suspended, effective Oct. 13, 2017, its share repurchase program, which subsequently expired on Dec. 31, 2017. During fourth quarter 2017, $83 million of common dividends were paid to shareholders for a total return of capital to shareholders of $136 million during the quarter. For full year 2017, share repurchases totaled $1.0 billion and common dividends paid were $341 million, for a total return to shareholders of $1.4 billion.

Dec. 31, 2017 book value per diluted share of $37.11 declined from $44.35 as of Dec. 31, 2016 due to the 20% decrease in stockholders' equity over the period, partially offset by a 5% decrease in common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares. The decrease in stockholders' equity was due to the 2017 net loss, share repurchases and common stockholder dividends paid in 2017, partially offset by an increase in AOCI. The reduction in shares outstanding was due to 2017 share repurchases. Excluding AOCI, book value per diluted share of $35.29 as of Dec. 31, 2017 declined from $45.24 at Dec. 31, 2016. 

Return on equity (ROE) - net loss was 20.6% for full year 2017 compared with ROE - net income of 5.2% for full year 2016. ROE - core earnings for 2017 rose to 6.7% from 5.2% in full year 2016 due to an 11% increase in core earnings and a 15% decrease in average stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI.

DISCUSSION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Hartford uses non-GAAP financial measures in this press release to assist investors in analyzing the company's operating performance for the periods presented herein. Because The Hartford's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing The Hartford's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies. Definitions and calculations of other financial measures used in this press release can be found below and in The Hartford's Investor Financial Supplement for fourth quarter 2017, which is available on The Hartford's website, https://ir.thehartford.com.

Annualized investment yield, excluding limited partnerships is the annualized net investment income excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments divided by the monthly average invested assets at amortized cost, excluding repurchase agreement and securities lending collateral, derivatives book value, and limited partnerships and other alternative investments. The company believes that annualized net investment income, excluding limited partnerships, provides investors with an important measure of the trend in investment earnings because it excludes the impact of the volatility in returns related to limited partnerships.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI: Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, is calculated based upon non-GAAP financial measures. It is calculated by dividing (a) total stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI, after tax, by (b) common shares outstanding or common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares. The Company provides this measure to enable investors to analyze the amount of the Company's net worth that is primarily attributable to the Company's business operations. The Company believes it is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates. Book value per diluted share is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. A reconciliation of book value per diluted share, including AOCI to book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI is set forth below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

16

Core Earnings: The Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings as an important measure of the company’s operating performance. The Hartford believes that the measure core earnings provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the company’s ongoing businesses because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services businesses that may be obscured by including the net effect of certain realized capital gains and losses, certain restructuring and other costs, integration and transaction costs in connection with an acquired business, pension settlements, loss on extinguishment of debt, gains and losses on reinsurance transactions, income tax benefit from reduction in deferred income tax valuation allowance, impact of tax reform on net deferred tax assets, and results of discontinued operations. Some realized capital gains and losses are primarily driven by investment decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance and underwriting aspects of our business.

Accordingly, core earnings excludes the effect of all realized gains and losses (net of tax and the effects of DAC) that tend to be highly variable from period to period based on capital market conditions. The Hartford believes, however, that some realized capital gains and losses are integrally related to our insurance operations, so core earnings includes net realized gains and losses such as net periodic settlements on credit derivatives. These net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting item included in the income statement such as net investment income. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Core earnings should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of the company’s business. Therefore, The Hartford believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate both net income (loss) and core earnings when reviewing the company’s performance.

A reconciliation of net income (loss) to core earnings for the quarterly periods ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, is included in this press release. A reconciliation of net income (loss) to core earnings for individual reporting segments can be found in this press release under the heading "The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. Consolidating Income Statements" and in The Hartford's Investor Financial Supplement for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017. 

17

Core earnings margin: The Hartford uses the non-GAAP measure core earnings margin to evaluate, and believes it is an important measure of, the Group Benefits segment's operating performance. Core earnings margin is calculated by dividing core earnings by revenues, excluding buyouts and realized gains (losses). Net income margin is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The company believes that core earnings margin provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of Group Benefits because it reveals trends in the business that may be obscured by the effect of buyouts and realized gains (losses). Core earnings margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income margin and does not reflect the overall profitability of Group Benefits. Therefore, the company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both core earnings margin and net income margin when reviewing performance. A reconciliation of net income margin to core earnings margin for the quarterly periods ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, is set forth below. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Core earnings per diluted share: Core earnings per diluted share is calculated based on the non-GAAP financial measure core earnings. It is calculated by dividing (a) core earnings, by (b) diluted common shares outstanding. The Hartford believes that the measure core earnings per diluted share provides investors with a valuable measure of the company's operating performance for the same reasons applicable to its underlying measure, core earnings. Net income (loss) per diluted common share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Core earnings per diluted share should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) per diluted share and does not reflect the overall profitability of the company's business.

Therefore, The Hartford believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate both net income (loss) per diluted share and core earnings per diluted share when reviewing the company's performance. A reconciliation of net income (loss) per diluted common share to core earnings per diluted share for the quarterly periods ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016 is provided in the table below. 

18

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[1] Includes dilutive potential common shares

[2] For the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, weighted average shares outstanding used in calculating net loss per share excludes the effect of dilutive securities of 6.8 million shares. The calculation of core earnings per share includes the effect of dilutive securities in all periods presented. In periods where a net loss before discontinued operations or a core loss is recognized, inclusion of incremental dilution is antidilutive.

Net investment income, excluding limited partnerships: is the amount of net investment income earned from invested assets excluding the net investment income related to limited partnerships and other alternative investments. The company believes that net investment income, excluding limited partnerships, provides investors with an important measure of the trend in investment earnings because it excludes the impact of the volatility in returns related to limited partnerships.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Return on Equity - Core Earnings: The company provides different measures of the return on stockholders' equity (“ROE”). ROE - Net income is calculated by dividing (a) net income for the prior four fiscal quarters by (b) average common stockholders' equity, including AOCI. ROE - Core earnings is calculated based on non-GAAP financial measures. ROE - Core earnings is calculated by dividing (a) core earnings for the prior four fiscal quarters by (b) average common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI. ROE - Net income is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. The company excludes AOCI in the calculation of ROE - Core earnings to provide investors with a measure of how effectively the company is investing the portion of the company's net worth that is primarily attributable to the company's business operations. The company provides to investors return-on-equity measures based on its non-GAAP core earnings financial measures for the reasons set forth in the related discussion above.

A reconciliation of Consolidated ROE - Net income to Consolidated ROE - Core earnings is set forth below. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Underlying combined ratio: Represents the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development (PYD) and is a non-GAAP financial measure. Combined ratio is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio (also known as a loss ratio), the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio. This ratio measures the cost of losses and expenses for every $100 of earned premiums. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates a positive underwriting result. A combined ratio above 100 indicates a negative underwriting result. The underlying combined ratio represents the combined ratio for the current accident year, excluding the impact of current accident year catastrophes. The company believes this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense reserve. A reconciliation of the combined ratio to the underlying combined ratio for individual reporting segments can be found in this press release under the heading "Fourth Quarter 2017 Segment Financial Results Summary."

Underwriting gain (loss): The Hartford's management evaluates profitability of the Commercial and Personal Lines segments primarily on the basis of underwriting gain or loss. Underwriting gain (loss) is a before tax measure that represents earned premiums less incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Underwriting gain (loss) is influenced significantly by earned premium growth and the adequacy of The Hartford's pricing. Underwriting profitability over time 

20

is also greatly influenced by The Hartford's underwriting discipline, as management strives to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, effective management of claims, use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expenses. The Hartford believes that the measure underwriting gain (loss) provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability, before tax, derived from underwriting activities, which are managed separately from the company's investing activities. A reconciliation of underwriting results to net income for the quarterly periods ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, is set forth in the Investor Financial Supplement for quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017, which is available on The Hartford's website, https://ir.thehartford.com.
