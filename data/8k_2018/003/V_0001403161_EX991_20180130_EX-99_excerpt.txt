2 Fiscal First Quarter 2018 — Financial Highlights GAAP net income in the fiscal first quarter was $2.52 billion or $1.07 per share, an increase of 22% and 25%, respectively, over prior year's results. Excluding two special items in this quarter's results related to U.S. tax reform, adjusted net income for the quarter was $2.54 billion or $1.08 per share, an increase of 23% and 26%, respectively, over prior year's results. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year positively impacted earnings per share growth by approximately 1 percentage point. All references to earnings per share assume fully-diluted class A share count, inclusive of series B and C convertible participating preferred stock, unless otherwise noted. The Company’s adjusted effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share of class A common stock are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying financial tables. GAAP effective income tax rate, which included two non-recurring special items related to U.S. tax reform, was 22.1% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The two special items are: • Estimated benefit of $1.13 billion related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities based on the new corporate tax rate; and • Estimated charge of $1.15 billion related to a transition tax on certain foreign earnings; in transitioning to the new territorial tax system, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act requires a transition tax on previously untaxed deferred foreign earnings, payable over eight years. Excluding these special items, the adjusted effective tax rate was 21.7%. Both GAAP and adjusted effective tax rates are 6 percentage points lower than they would have been, as a result of recurring tax reform benefits associated with the lower corporate tax rate. Net operating revenues in the fiscal first quarter were $4.9 billion, an increase of 9%, driven by continued growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year positively impacted reported net operating revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point. Payments volume for the three months ended September 30, 2017, on which fiscal first quarter service revenue is recognized, grew 10% over the prior year on a constant dollar basis. As a reminder, Europe co-badged volume is no longer included in reported volume. Payments volume for the three months ended December 31, 2017, grew 10% over the prior year on a constant dollar basis. Cross-border volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, was 9% for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by Visa, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, were 30.5 billion, a 12% increase over the prior year. Fiscal first quarter service revenues were $2.1 billion, an increase of 12% over the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 13% over the prior year to $2.1 billion. International transaction revenues grew 12% over the prior year to $1.7 billion. Other revenues of $229 million rose 13% over the prior year. Client incentives, which are a contra revenue item, were $1.3 billion and represent 21.4% of gross revenues. Operating expenses were $1.5 billion for the fiscal first quarter, a 13% increase over the prior year's results primarily from higher personnel costs. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investment securities were $14.1 billion at December 31, 2017. The weighted-average number of diluted shares of class A common stock outstanding was 2.35 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.  

3 Fiscal First Quarter 2018 — Other Notable Items During the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 15.5 million shares of class A common stock, at an average price of $110.67 per share, using $1.7 billion of cash on hand. The board of directors has authorized a new $7.5 billion class A common stock share repurchase program. Including this additional authorization, the Company now has $9.1 billion of funds available for share repurchase. In October 2017, the Company used the majority of the proceeds from its September 2017 debt offering to redeem the $1.75 billion of senior notes which was scheduled to mature in December 2017. On January 30, 2018, the board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.21 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as- converted basis) payable on March 6, 2018, to all holders of record as of February 16, 2018. Financial Outlook for Fiscal Full-Year 2018 Visa Inc. reaffirms its financial outlook for the following metrics for fiscal full-year 2018: • Annual net revenue growth of high single digits on a nominal dollar basis, with approximately 0.5 to 1 percentage point of positive foreign currency impact; • Client incentives as a percentage of gross revenues: 21.5% to 22.5% range; • Annual operating margin: High 60s; Visa Inc. updates its financial outlook for the following metrics for fiscal full-year 2018: • Annual operating expense growth: High end of mid-single digits adjusted for special items in fiscal 2017 (see note below); • GAAP and adjusted effective tax rate: Approximately 23%, which includes a 6 percentage point reduction resulting from U.S. tax reform; and • Annual diluted class A common stock earnings per share growth including the impact of U.S. tax reform: Mid-50's on a GAAP nominal dollar basis and high end of mid-20's on an adjusted, non-GAAP nominal dollar basis (see note below). Both include approximately 9 to 10 percentage points driven by U.S. tax reform and approximately 1 to 1.5 percentage points of positive foreign currency impact. Note: The financial outlook for fiscal full-year 2018 includes Visa Europe integration expenses of approximately $60 million for the full-year. Annual operating expense growth is derived from adjusted full-year 2017 operating expenses of $6.0 billion. Annual adjusted diluted class A common stock earnings per share growth is derived from adjusted full-year 2017 earnings per share results of $3.48.

9 VISA INC. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL RESULTS FISCAL FIRST QUARTER 2018 (UNAUDITED) Our financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2017 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we believe were not indicative of our operating performance in these or future periods, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. There were no comparable adjustments recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2016. • Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, in connection with the tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's reduction of the corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion. • Transition tax on foreign earnings. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's requirement that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income, we recorded a one-time transition tax estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion. Adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table reconciles our as-reported financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non- GAAP adjusted financial measures for the three months ended December 31, 2017. There were no comparable adjustments recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2016.

10 VISA INC. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL RESULTS FISCAL FULL-YEAR 2017 (UNAUDITED) Our fiscal full-year 2018 annual diluted class A common stock earnings per share growth outlook is based on adjusted non-GAAP fiscal full-year 2017 results, which are reconciled to their closest comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure below. Our financial results during the twelve months ended September 30, 2017 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in these or future periods, as they are either non-recurring or have no cash impact. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the period presented. • Elimination of deferred tax balances. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, in connection with our legal entity reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion. • Charitable contribution. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, associated with our legal entity reorganization, we recognized a non- recurring, non-cash general and administrative expense of $192 million, before tax, related to the charitable donation of Visa Inc. shares that were acquired as part of the Visa Europe acquisition and held as treasury stock. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $71 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income increased by $121 million.

Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported (“Nominal USD”). These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information (“Constant USD”). This presentation represents Visa’s historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement. Effective June 9, 2016, Article 8 of the EU Interchange Fee Regulation states that payment card networks cannot impose reporting requirements or the obligation to pay fees on payment transactions where their payment brand is present but their network is not used. Prior to this regulation, Visa collected a small service fee in a few countries, particularly France, on domestic payment transactions where Visa cards are co-badged with a domestic network. Clients in Europe continued to report co-badged volume through the quarter ended September 2016; however, Europe co-badged volume and transactions have been excluded from all periods.
