 Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure  

 On January 17, 2018, Frontier Communications Corporation (the “Company” or “Frontier”) launched amendments to its credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and CoBank ACB, respectively, to, among other things, replace the existing leverage ratio maintenance test in the credit agreements with a first lien net leverage ratio maintenance test. In connection therewith, Frontier made available to the lenders under the credit agreements a presentation discussing the Company and the proposed amendments. A copy of that presentation is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.   

 The information in the lender presentation should be read in conjunction with the Company’s other filings with the SEC, including its most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, filed on November 2, 2017, and the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 31, 2017. For a reconciliation of certain Non-GAAP measures included in the lender presentation to the most comparable GAAP measures, see the Company’s earnings release furnished with the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 31, 2017.
