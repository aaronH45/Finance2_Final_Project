Cimarex Energy Co. (NYSE: XEC) today reported fourth quarter 2017 net income of $174.7 million, or $1.83 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2016 net income of $47.8 million, or $0.50 per share.

Cash flow from operations was $340.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to $185.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted cash flow from operations (non-GAAP) totaled $357.1 million in the fourth quarter, a 63 percent increase from 2016 levels1. 

For the year, net income totaled $494.3 million, or $5.19 per share. The adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for the full year was $443.2 million, or $4.65 per share1. Cash flow from operations totaled $1,096.6 million in 2017 compared to $625.8 million in 2016. Adjusted cash flow from operations (non-GAAP) totaled $1,185.6 million in 2017, an 88 percent increase from 2016 levels1. Revenues in 2017 totaled $1.9 billion, a 53 percent increase from 2016. The increase in revenues and cash flow was the result of higher production and higher realized product prices. 

In the fourth quarter, total company production volumes averaged 1,204 million cubic feet equivalent (MMcfe) per day (201 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE) per day), up 25 percent from a year ago. Fourth quarter oil production averaged 61,771 barrels per day, an increase of 36 percent from 2016 levels. For the full year, Cimarex reported daily production volumes of 1,142 MMcfe per day (190 MBOE per day), up 19 percent from our 2016 average daily output of 963 MMcfe per day.

Cimarex invested $1.28 billion in exploration and development (E&D) in 2017, including $344 million in the fourth quarter. Investments made in 2017 were funded with cash flow and cash on hand. E&D capital exceeded the company's estimate for 2017 of $1.2 billion due to higher infrastructure spending, higher working interest and costs in outside operated wells, land acquisition and acceleration of activity. 

Proved reserves at December 31, 2017 were 3.4 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe) or 559 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE), up 16 percent year over year. Proved developed reserves increased 21 percent to 2.8 Tcfe. Cimarex added 941 Bcfe through extensions and discoveries and deducted 60 Bcfe through net revisions resulting in reserve replacement of 211 percent of 2017 production. Proved reserves are 83 percent proved developed.

Realized oil prices averaged $51.68 per barrel in the fourth quarter, 16 percent higher than the same period a year ago. Realized natural gas prices were lower in the fourth quarter and averaged $2.58 per Mcf versus $2.86 a year ago. Realized NGL prices averaged $25.88 per barrel up 43 percent compared to fourth quarter 2016. For the full year, realized oil prices averaged $47.06, up 23 percent from 2016. Realized natural gas prices averaged $2.76 per Mcf, a 19 percent increase from 2016. Realized NGL prices averaged $21.61 per barrel, up 54 percent from 2016 levels. 

Total debt at December 31, 2017 consisted of $1.5 billion of long-term notes, with $750 million maturing in 2024 and $750 million maturing in 2027. Cimarex had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility and had a cash balance of $401 million. Debt was 37 percent of total capitalization2.

Permian Basin 

Production from the Permian Basin averaged 673 MMcfe per day in the fourth quarter, a 32 percent increase over fourth quarter 2016, and a seven percent increase sequentially. Oil volumes averaged 47,642 barrels per day and represented 42 percent of the region's total equivalent production. For the full year, production averaged 631 MMcfe per day, up 25 percent year over year. 

Cimarex brought 32 gross (14 net) wells on production in the Permian region during the fourth quarter, bringing the total for the year to 97 gross (55 net) wells. Cimarex currently operates ten rigs in the Permian region. 

Activity in the Permian region in the fourth quarter included the completion of 14 wells in the Wolfcamp, Avalon and Bone Spring formations. Cimarex also began drilling operations on two multi-well Wolfcamp developments. The Animal Kingdom project, located in Culberson County, Texas, consists of eight wells targeting multiple landings in the Lower Wolfcamp and the Snowshoe project, located in Reeves County, Texas, is an eight-well project targeting multiple landings in the Upper Wolfcamp. Both are long lateral developments with first production expected during the third quarter of 2018. 

As of year-end, Cimarex has completed 70 10,000-foot lateral Wolfcamp wells including 23 in the Lower Wolfcamp and 47 in the Upper Wolfcamp. In addition to the multiple spacing pilots drilled in the Wolfcamp in 2017, another highlight of the year's program was the completion of four 10,000-foot lateral Upper Wolfcamp wells on the western half of our Culberson County acreage, an area that was previously untested. These wells had an average 30-day peak initial production of 2,587 BOE per day (56 percent oil, 26 percent gas, 18 percent NGL). A fifth well is currently flowing back. Cimarex has additional activity planned in this area in 2018 including a development project with drilling scheduled to begin in the third quarter.

Mid-Continent 

Production from the Mid-Continent region averaged 529 MMcfe per day in the fourth quarter, a 19 percent increase over fourth-quarter 2016, and a three percent increase sequentially. Oil volumes averaged 13,999 barrels per day and represented 16 percent of the region's total equivalent production. For the full year, production averaged 509 MMcfe per day, up 11 percent year over year. 

Wells brought on production during the fourth quarter totaled 85 gross (10 net) in the Mid-Continent region, bringing the total wells in 2017 to 222 gross (43 net). As planned, drilling to hold company's Meramec acreage was completed in 2017. 

Activity in the region continues to focus on the Woodford and Meramec shale plays in western Oklahoma. Recent highlights include the completion of a three-well, stacked Woodford/Meramec test in the 14N-10W township in Canadian County, Oklahoma. This test confirms results of our previous wells in the area. Cimarex operates nearly all of the 24,000 gross acres leased in the 14N-10W area with an average 62 percent working interest. Drilling activity continues in the high return Lone Rock area where Cimarex has six long lateral Woodford wells on production with average 30-day peak initial production of 1,806 BOE per day (35 percent oil, 36 percent gas, 29 percent NGL). The company is currently drilling the Shelly spacing pilot in Lone Rock with first production expected mid-summer.

Cimarex currently operates four rigs in the Mid-Continent.
