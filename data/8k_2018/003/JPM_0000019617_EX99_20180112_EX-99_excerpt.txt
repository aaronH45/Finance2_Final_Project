F I N A N C I A L R E S U L T S 2 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act – impact to JPM financials Key questions and current expectations Impact to 4Q17 results1 ($B)  Will JPM actually repatriate cash and if so how will it be used?  No significant remittance of cash expected – we have capital and liquidity requirements in foreign entities – it is a deemed repatriation  Why does a reduction of 14% in the federal tax rate translate into a lower reduction in the JPM effective tax rate?  Difference driven by the geographic mix of taxable income, non- deductibility of FDIC fees and the impact of a lower tax rate on other deductions  Do you anticipate JPM will be subject to the Base Erosion Anti- abuse Tax (“BEAT”)?  Uncertain – but we do not expect any material impact from BEAT  How and when do the tax benefits get competed away?  Uncertain – competitive dynamics will be different across businesses and products and will play out over time  Does the lower tax rate change JPM’s capital distribution plan?  Our capital hierarchy and strategy do not change – 1H18 distributions based on 2017 CCAR  What will be the impact on JPM’s businesses?  IB fees – positive for M&A and ECM, negative for DCM – overall net positive  Corporate Lending – supportive to corporate loan demand over time  Home Lending – small negative (home price appreciation slightly lower) but de minimis overall impact to demand  What is JPM doing to share the benefit with its employees, customers and communities?  In addition to programs already in place, we are planning a broad set of strategic and sustainable benefits for our employees, customers and communities Expect the effective tax rate to be ~19% in 2018 and ~20% in the near-term Expect tax reform to be a catalyst for economic activity and growth Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding 1 Represents the estimated impact of the TCJA; the estimate may be refined in future periods as further information becomes available.

Outlook F I N A N C I A L R E S U L T S Firmwide  As a result of the change in tax rate due to TCJA, expect a reduction in tax-equivalent adjustments, decreasing both managed revenue and managed tax expense by ~$1.2B on an annual run-rate basis  New revenue recognition accounting rule expected to increase both FY2018 revenue and expense by ~$1.2B, with the vast majority of the impact in AWM  Expect FY2018 effective tax rate to be ~19%  Expect 1Q18 net interest income to be modestly lower QoQ due to the impact of TCJA and day count 11  

Notes on non-GAAP financial measures 1. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. 2. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 9 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share was $67.04, $66.95 and $64.06 at December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. 3. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense excluded Firmwide legal expense/(benefit) of $(207) million, $(107) million and $230 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, and $(35) million and $(317) million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of adjusted managed net revenue, which excluded a legal benefit of $645 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance. 4. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was signed into law. The fourth quarter of 2017 and full-year 2017 results reflect the estimated impact of the enactment of the TCJA, which resulted in a $2.4 billion decrease to net income. The full year results also included a legal benefit of $406 million (after-tax) related to a settlement with the FDIC receivership for Washington Mutual and with Deutsche Bank as trustee to certain Washington Mutual trusts. Net income, EPS and ROE excluding the impact of these significant items are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures help investors understand the effect of these items on reported results. 5. Net charge-offs and net charge-off rates exclude the impact of PCI loans. 6. CIB calculates the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans excluding the impact of consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade finance loans, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio. Notes on key performance measures 7. Estimated as of December 31, 2017. The Basel III supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”), to which the Firm is subject to since January 1, 2018, and Basel III Fully Phased- In capital, risk-weighted assets and capital ratios, to which the Firm will be subject on January 1, 2019, are all considered key regulatory capital measures. The capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the Basel III approach (Standardized or Advanced) that results, for each quarter, in the lower ratio (the “Collins Floor”). These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, including the Collins Floor, see Capital Risk Management on pages 76-85 of the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and pages 42-48 of the Firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. 8. Core loans represent loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; core loans exclude loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit.

The prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation 6. During 3Q17, Card refined its inactive credit card account policy, resulting in more frequent reviews and closures of certain inactive accounts. The impact of this refinement was a cumulative decrease of 0.3mm CCB households in 2H17 (0.2mm in 4Q17 and 0.1mm in 3Q17) 7. Firmwide mortgage origination volume was $26.6B, $29.2B and $33.5B, for 4Q17, 3Q17 and 4Q16, respectively 8. Excludes purchased credit-impaired (PCI) write-offs of $20mm, $20mm and $32mm for 4Q17, 3Q17 and 4Q16, respectively. See note 5 on slide 12 9. Excludes the impact of PCI loans. See note 5 on slide 12 10. Excludes Commercial Card Additional Note on slide 7 – Corporate & Investment Bank 11. The Firm refined the historical proxy time series inputs to certain VaR models during the first quarter of 2017. This refinement was intended to more appropriately reflect the risk exposure from certain asset-backed products. In the absence of this refinement, the average CIB VaR would have been higher by $2 million and $5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
