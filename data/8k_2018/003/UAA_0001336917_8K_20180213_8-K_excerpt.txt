Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On February 13, 2018, Under Armour, Inc. (“Under Armour”, or the “Company”) issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. A copy of Under Armour’s press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. Under Armour has scheduled a conference call for 8:30 a.m. ET on February 13, 2018 to discuss its financial results.

Item 2.05. Costs Associated With Exit or Disposal Activities.

The Company previously announced a 2017 restructuring plan, which resulted in approximately $129 million of pre-tax restructuring and related charges during its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. After additional review, the Company has identified further opportunities to optimize its operations and on February 9, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an additional 2018 restructuring plan. 

In connection with the 2018 restructuring plan, the Company expects to incur approximately $110 million to $130 million of estimated pre-tax restructuring and related charges during 2018. The Company anticipates that these restructuring and related charges will consist primarily of:

•up to $105 million of cash restructuring charges, consisting of up to $55 million in facility and lease termination costs, and up to $50 million in contract termination and other restructuring costs; and

•up to $25 million of non-cash charges comprised of up to $10 million of inventory related charges, and up to $15 million of asset related impairments.

This disclosure contains forward-looking statements within the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than those that are purely historical are forward-looking statements, and include statements regarding anticipated charges and restructuring costs and the timing of these measures. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause the estimated future impact of these charges and restructuring costs to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These risks include the Company’s ability to successfully execute its restructuring plan, higher than anticipated costs in implementing the restructuring plan, management distraction from ongoing business activities and damage to the Company’s reputation and brand image. Additional information regarding other factors that could cause the Company’s results to differ can be found in the Company’s press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and the Company’s subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements contained in this disclosure reflects the Company’s views and assumptions only as of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which this disclosure is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
