J P M C I N T E R N A L U S E O N L Y Notes on non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures N O T E S Notes on non-GAAP financial measures 1. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management review s Firmw ide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmw ide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also review s the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, w ith the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassif ications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These f inancial measures allow management to ass ess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded w ithin income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a w hole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 52 of the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (“2017 Form 10-K”) 2. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identif iable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. For a reconciliation from common stockholders’ equity to TCE, see page 54 of the 2017 Form 10-K. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. Book value per share w as $67.04 at December 31, 2017. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as w ell as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity 3. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted expense excluded Firmw ide legal expense/(benefit) of $(35) million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The adjusted overhead ratio measures the Firm’s adjusted expense as a percentage of adjusted managed net revenue, w hich excluded a legal benefit of $645 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance 4. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (“TCJA”) w as signed into law . Full-year 2017 results reflect the estimated impact of the enactment of the TCJA, w hich resulted in a $145 million decrease to managed revenue and a $2.4 billion decrease to net income. The full year results also included a legal benefit of $406 million (after-tax) related to a settlement w ith the FDIC receivership for Washington Mutual and w ith Deutsche Bank as trustee to certain Washington Mutual trusts. Net income, EPS, ROTCE and TBVPS excluding the impact of these signif icant items are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these measures help investors understand the effect of these items on reported results as w ell as facilitate a comparison w ith the performance of peers 5. Net charge-off (“NCO”) rates exclude purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans; this is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of the NCO rates, including the impact of PCI loans, see pages 59-60 of the 2017 Form 10-K Notes on key performance measures 6. The Basel III supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”), to w hich the Firm w as subject to since January 1, 2018, and the Basel III Fully Phased-In common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, risk-w eighted assets (“RWA”) and the CET1 ratio to w hich the Firm w ill be subject on January 1, 2019, are all considered key regulatory capital measures. The capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the Basel III approach (Standardized or Advanced) that results in the low er ratio as required by the Collins Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Collins Floor”). These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, including the Collins Floor, see Capital Risk Management on pages 82-91 of the 2017 Form 10-K 7. Core loans represent loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses; core loans exclude loans classif ied as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit 76

J P M C I N T E R N A L U S E O N L Y Notes on slide 10 – The business case for digital is compelling 1. For digitally engaged households 2. Reflects Consumer Bank; Consumer Bank household channel segments are defined based on the tenure of the household as of the respective time period. For households with tenure of greater than 12 months, we use the following thresholds calculated over a year: Digitally-centric – <=4 branch visits and 12+ digital transactions or 100+ digital log-ins or 24+ external ACH transactions per year; Multi-channel – >4 branch visits and 12+ digital transactions or 100+ digital log-ins or 24+ external ACH transactions per year; Branch-centric – >4 branch visits and <12 digital transactions and <100 digital log-ins and <24 external ACH transactions per year; Other – <=4 branch visits and <12 digital transactions and <100 digital log-ins and <24 external ACH transactions per year. For households that are less than 12 months on book, we reduce the thresholds by 75% and track the household activity over a three-month time period. Digitally-engaged households includes Digitally-centric households and Multi-channel households. All other households includes Branch-centric households and Other households 3. Net Promoter Score = % promoters minus % detractors. Based on Net Promoter Score data collected from December 2016 through November 2017 4. Retention rates are based on Consumer Bank households with deposit products and exclude households that closed all of their deposit products with Chase. Retention rate for each Consumer Bank household channel segment is calculated by reclassifying households into segments each month based on their channel activity and by taking an average of the annualized monthly rates for the last 12 months as of November 2017 5.
