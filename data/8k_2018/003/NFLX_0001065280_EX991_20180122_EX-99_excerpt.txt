Fellow shareholders,

We had a beautiful Q4, completing a great year as internet TV expands globally. In 2017, we grew streaming revenue 36% to over $11 billion, added 24 million new memberships (compared to 19 million in 2016), achieved for the first time a full-year positive international contribution profit, and more than doubled global operating income.

Q4 Results

Average paid streaming memberships rose 25% year over year in Q4. Combined with a 9% increase in ASP, global streaming revenue growth amounted to 35%. Operating income of $245 million (7.5% margin) vs. $154 million prior year (6.2% margin) was slightly above our $238 million forecast. Operating margin for FY17 was 7.2%, on target with our goal at the beginning of this year. 

EPS was $0.41 vs. $0.15 last year and met our forecast of $0.41. There were several below the line items that affected net income, including a pre-tax $26 million non-cash unrealized loss from F/X remeasurement on our Eurobond. Our tax rate was helped by a $66 million foreign tax benefit, which partially offset a revaluation of our deferred tax assets and the impact from the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings related to the recent US tax reform. 

In Q4, we registered global net adds of 8.3 million, the highest quarter in our history and up 18% vs. last year’s record 7.05 million net adds. This exceeded our 6.3m forecast due primarily to stronger than expected acquisition fueled by our original content slate and the ongoing global adoption of internet entertainment. Geographically, the outperformance vs. guidance was broad-based.

In the US, memberships rose by 2.0 million (vs. forecast of 1.25m) bringing total FY17 net adds to 5.3 million. ASP rose 5% year-over-year. Domestic contribution profit increased 5% year-over-year although contribution margin of 34.4% declined both on a year-over-year and sequential basis due to the marketing spend we noted in last quarter’s investor letter. 

Internationally, we added 6.36 million memberships (compared with guidance of 5.05m), a new record for quarterly net adds for this segment. Excluding a F/X impact of +$43 million, international revenue and ASP grew 59% and 12% year over year, respectively. The increase in ASP reflects price adjustments in a wide variety of our markets over the course of 2017. With contribution profit of $227 million in 2017 (4.5% contribution margin), the international segment delivered its first full year of positive contribution profit in our history. 

We took a $39m non-cash charge in Q4 for unreleased content we’ve decided not to move forward with. This charge was recognized in content expense in cost of revenues. Despite this unexpected expense, we slightly exceeded our contribution profit and operating income forecast due to our stronger than expected member growth and the timing of international content spend.

Forecast

The guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report. For Q1, we project global net adds of 6.35 million (vs. 5.0m in the year ago quarter), with 1.45m in the US and 4.90m internationally. As we wrote last quarter, our primary profit metric is operating margin and we are targeting a full year 2018 target of 10%, up about 300 basis points year over year, as in the prior year. 

We believe our big investments in content are paying off. In 2017, average streaming hours per membership grew by 9% year-over-year. With greater than expected member growth (resulting in more revenue), we now plan to spend $7.5-$8.0 billion on content on a P&L basis in 2018.

Big hits like 13 Reasons Why, Stranger Things and Bright result from a combination of great content and great marketing. We’re taking marketing spend up a little faster than revenue for this year (from about $1.3B to approximately $2B) because our testing results indicate this is wise. We want great content, and we want the budget to make the hits we have really big, to drive our membership growth. We’ll grow our technology & development investment to roughly $1.3 billion in 2018. 

Content

Q4 capped an amazing year for Netflix original content with returning seasons of The Crown and Black Mirror as well as Stranger Things, which cemented its place as a global phenomenon. In the quarter, we also successfully launched new titles like the limited series Godless, Marvel’s The Punisher and Mindhunter (from director David Fincher), the latter two of which are renewed for a second season. It’s amazing to think that in only 5 years since launching our first original series, Netflix had three of the Top 51 most searched TV shows globally for the second year in a row. 

Our largest investment in original films to date, Bright, a fantasy action movie starring Will Smith, was a major success and drove a notable lift in acquisition. In its first month, Bright has become one of our most viewed original titles ever. We’re thrilled with this performance and are planning a sequel as well as additional investment in original films. 

We’re finding continued success with international originals and in Q4 we released: season 3 of Club de Cuervos as well as The Day I Met El Chapo, both of which are from Mexico; Suburra from Italy; and an unscripted series from the UK, Jack Whitehall: Travels with My Father. We also debuted Dark2, our first German original drama series. High-quality content can travel globally, irrespective of language; for instance, Dark, in addition to being well-received in its home country, has also been viewed by millions of members in the US and has outsized watching throughout Europe and Latin America. Combined with attractive economics and a positive impact on our business in local markets, we will expand this initiative with over 30 international original series this year, including projects from France, Poland, India, Korea and Japan. 

We are increasingly self-producing our original content. As part of this initiative, in Q4 we signed overall deals with Stranger Things producer Shawn Levy and Orange is the New Black and GLOW creator Jenji Kohan. Our goal is to work directly with the best talent to bring amazing stories to our members all over the world.

Product and Partnerships

We are partnering with a growing number of MVPDs and ISPs across the world to the benefit of our mutual customers. These partnerships make it easier for consumers to sign up, enjoy and pay for Netflix, while our service allows our partners to deepen their relationships with these subscribers. Examples of these types of partnerships that we struck in Q4 include an expanded global partnership with Deutsche Telekom and with Cox Communications and Verizon Communications in the US. As expected, the FCC removed the US net neutrality rules. We believe that a strong internet should have enforceable net

neutrality rules, so we and other internet firms are backing the Internet Association’s challenge to the FCC’s action. 

Competition

We have been talking about the transition from linear to streaming for the past 10 years. As this trend becomes increasingly evident, more companies are entering the market for premium video content. On the commercial-free tech side, Amazon Studios is likely to bring in a strong new leader given their large content budgets, and Apple is growing its programming, which we presume will either be bundled with Apple Music or with iOS. 

Facebook and YouTube are expanding and competing in free ad-supported video content. With their multi-billion global audiences, free ad-supported internet video is a big force in the market for entertainment time, as well as a great advertising vehicle for Netflix. 

Traditional media companies are also expanding into streaming. Disney is in the process of acquiring most of 21st Century Fox and plans to launch a direct-to-consumer service in 2019 with a beloved brand and great franchises. The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful services. In addition, entertainment services are often complementary given their unique content offerings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow. 

Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure

In Q4, free cash flow amounted to -$524 million, bringing full year 2017 FCF to -$2.0 billion, at the lower end of the -$2.0 to -$2.5 billion range we had previously indicated. This was largely due to the timing of content payments, which will now occur in 2018. 

Our operating margins and income are rising, and our only material cash-ahead-of-P&L-expense is content. When we develop a title like Bright, the cash spend is 1-3 years before the viewing, associated membership growth, and P&L expense. Thus, the faster we grow our originals budget (particularly for self-produced content), the more cash we consume. We are increasing operating margins and expect that in the future, a combination of rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spend will turn our business FCF positive. 

In the near term, however, membership, revenue and original content spend are booming. We’re growing faster than we expected, which allows us to invest more in original content than we had planned, so our FCF will be around negative $3B-$4B in 2018. Given our track record of content investments helping to increase growth, we are excited about the growth in future years from the increased investments we are making in original content this year. 

We anticipate continuing to raise capital in the high yield market. The new limitation on deductibility of interest costs is not expected to affect us. We are striving to make the right choices and investments to grow the value of the firm, and that is what also ultimately secures our debt. High yield has rarely seen an equity cushion so thick.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow and EBITDA. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content. However, these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of these non-GAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.
