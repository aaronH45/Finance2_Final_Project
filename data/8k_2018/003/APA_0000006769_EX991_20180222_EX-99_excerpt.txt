HOUSTON, Feb. 22, 2018 – Apache Corporation (NYSE: APA) (Nasdaq: APA) today announced its financial and operational results for fourth-quarter and full-year 2017.  

Apache reported net income attributable to common stock of $456 million or $1.19 per diluted common share during the fourth quarter 2017. When adjusted for certain items that impact the

FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RESULTS; PROVIDES 2018 TO 2020 OUTLOOK  

– PAGE 2 of 8  

comparability of results including the impact of U.S. tax reform, Apache’s fourth-quarter income totaled $126 million, or $0.33 per share. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities in the fourth quarter was $668 million, and adjusted EBITDAX was $1.1 billion.  

For the full year 2017, Apache reported income of $1.3 billion, or $3.41 per diluted common share. On an adjusted basis, Apache’s 2017 income totaled $92 million, or $0.24 per share. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $2.4 billion, and adjusted EBITDAX was $3.7 billion in 2017.  

John J. Christmann IV, Apache’s chief executive officer and president, said, “2017 was a year of significant progress at Apache marked by several important milestones. In the Permian, we returned to a growth trajectory with notable oil growth in the Midland Basin and commencement of production from Alpine High. We made great technical progress in the Midland Basin increasing lateral lengths and utilizing technology to improve our recoveries and reduce our costs. We consolidated our land position, confirmed additional landing zones, and progressed numerous strategic tests. At Alpine High, we initiated first production ahead of schedule, substantially increased our inventory count, and began to realize operational efficiencies with pad drilling.  

“Internationally, we signed our first concessions in Egypt in 10 years, and with the help of modern-vintage 3D seismic, we expect to unlock significant future drilling opportunities in the region. We also completed our exit from Canada, further streamlining our portfolio. It was a year of numerous accomplishments that has set us up for great success in 2018 and beyond.”  

Capital budget and production outlook  

In 2018, the company plans to invest $3 billion in oil and gas capital, with more than 70 percent allocated to the Permian. This amount includes approximately $500 million for Alpine High midstream. Internationally, Apache will continue to invest at a level to sustain long-term free cash flow in Egypt and the North Sea.

From 2018 to 2020, Apache expects to invest approximately $7.5 billion in the upstream worldwide and $1 billion in midstream at Alpine High. Any monetization of the Alpine High midstream assets could eliminate some or all of this expected spend.  

Apache anticipates its returns-focused investment approach will result in a compound annual production growth rate of 11 to 13 percent worldwide and generate Cash Returns on Capital Invested (CROIC) of 18, 20 and 22 percent, respectively, over the  

three-year period.  

“Our three-year plan will generate strong returns and growth and will create significant long-term value for our shareholders. Over the last three years, Apache has returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders through the dividend. In the coming three years, we plan to return at least this amount and possibly more,” said Christmann.  

Fourth-quarter operational highlights  

During the fourth quarter, Apache operated an average of 36 rigs and drilled and completed 87 gross-operated wells worldwide. Highlights from Apache’s principal areas include:  

 •   North America – Apache operated an average of 21 rigs and drilled and completed 58 gross-operated wells in North America and reported production of 222,000 BOE per day.  

In the Permian Basin, Apache operated an average of 16 rigs and drilled and completed 57 gross-operated wells. Production averaged 177,000 BOE per day.  

   •   In the Midland Basin, Apache placed three multiwell pads on production. Drilling, completion and equipment costs decreased 20 percent from the first quarter of 2017 on a treated-lateral-foot basis, while volumes improved by approximately 17 percent.

   •   In the Delaware Basin, Apache averaged nine rigs, with six at Alpine High. The company completed construction of its fifth central processing unit at Alpine High bringing processing capacity to 280 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day with an additional 50 MMcf per day commissioned in January 2018.  

 •   International – Apache operated an average of 15 rigs and drilled and completed 29 gross-operated wells internationally and reported production of 218,000 BOE per day.  

   •   Egypt – The company completed nine wells with 24-hour initial production rates exceeding 1,000 BOE per day. Following the award of additional Western Desert concessions, the company is progressing an 1,800 square-kilometer 3D seismic shoot.  

   •   North Sea – The company completed the sale of the SAGE gas pipeline and brought online a third development well at Callater. Quarterly production was impacted by an unplanned 17-day shutdown on the third-party operated Forties Pipeline System.  

Financial position and liquidity  

At year-end, the company had $1.7 billion cash on hand, up from $1.4 billion at year-end 2016. During the year, asset sales generated $1.4 billion of proceeds and eliminated approximately $800 million of future asset retirement obligations. The company’s net debt position at year-end was $6.8 billion, down from $7.2 billion at year-end 2016.  

Year-end 2017 proved reserves  

Worldwide estimated proved reserves totaled 1.2 billion BOE at year-end 2017, down from 1.3 billion BOE at year-end 2016, primarily as a result of the company’s sale of its Canadian assets during 2017. The company replaced 124 percent of 2017 production through extensions and discoveries net of engineering revisions. All sources finding and development costs were $11.89 per BOE. Proved undeveloped reserves represented 13 percent of total proved reserves at year-end.

Changes in Apache’s reserves during the year consisted of the following: divestitures of 212 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) and production of 167 MMBOE; These decreases were offset by 230 MMBOE of proved reserves added through net extensions and discoveries, 2 MMBOE of proved reserves through purchases of minerals in-place, and revisions of previous estimates of 10 MMBOE.

Additional information  

Additional information follows, including reconciliations of adjusted earnings, adjusted EBITDAX and net debt (non-GAAP financial measures) to GAAP measures and information regarding adjusted production. Apache’s quarterly supplement is available at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata.  

Non-GAAP financial measures  

Apache’s financial information includes information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of our consolidated financial information as prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted earnings, adjusted EBITDAX and net debt are non-GAAP measures. This non-GAAP information should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure.  

Forward-looking statements  

This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “guidance,” “outlook,” and similar references to future periods. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future plans, expectations and objectives for Apache’s operations, including statements about our capital plans, drilling plans, production expectations, asset sales, and monetizations. While forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and analyses made by us that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,

whether actual results and developments will meet our expectations and predictions depend on a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results, performance, and financial condition to differ materially from our expectations. See “Risk Factors” in our 2016 Form 10-K filed, and 2017 Form 10-K when filed, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for a discussion of risk factors that affect our business. Any forward-looking statement made by Apache in this news release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Apache undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future development or otherwise, except as may be required by law.  

Cautionary note to investors  

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable, and possible reserves that meet the SEC’s definitions for such terms. Apache may use certain terms in this earnings release, such as “resources,” “potential resources,” “resource potential,” “estimated net reserves,” “recoverable reserves,” and other similar terms that the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit Apache from including in filings with the SEC. Such terms do not take into account the certainty of resource recovery, which is contingent on exploration success, technical improvements in drilling access, commerciality and other factors, and are therefore not indicative of expected future resource recovery and should not be relied upon. Investors are urged to consider carefully the disclosure in Apache’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2016 (and Apache’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2017, when filed) available from Apache at www.apachecorp.com or by writing Apache at: 2000 Post Oak Blvd., Suite 100, Houston, TX 77056 (Attn: Corporate Secretary). You can also obtain this report from the SEC by calling 1-800-SEC-0330 or from the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(In millions, except per share data)  

Reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted EBITDAX  

Management believes EBITDAX, or earnings before income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation, amortization and exploration expense is a widely accepted financial indicator, and useful for investors, to assess a company’s ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures, and make distributions to shareholders. We define adjusted EBITDAX, a non-GAAP financial measure, as EBITDAX adjusted for certain items presented in the accompanying reconciliation. Management uses adjusted EBITDAX to evaluate our ability to fund our capital expenditures, debt services and other operational requirements and to compare our results from period to period by eliminating the impact of certain items that management does not consider to be representative of the Company’s on-going operations. Management also believes adjusted EBITDAX facilitates investors and analysts in evaluating and comparing EBITDAX from period to period by eliminating differences caused by the existence and timing of certain operating expenses that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. However, our presentation of adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies in our industry.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reconciliation of income (loss) attributable to common stock to adjusted earnings  

Our presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures because they exclude the effect of certain items included in Income Attributable to Common Stock. Management believes that adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share provides relevant and useful information, which is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry as well as by our management in assessing the Company’s operational trends and comparability of results to our peers.  

Management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share to evaluate our operating and financial performance because it eliminates the impact of certain items that management does not consider to be representative of the Company’s on-going business operations. As a performance measure, adjusted earnings may be useful to investors in facilitating comparisons to others in the Company’s industry because certain items can vary substantially in the oil and gas industry from company to company depending upon accounting methods, book value of assets, capital structure and asset sales and other divestitures, among other factors. Management believes excluding these items facilitates investors and analysts in evaluating and comparing the underlying operating and financial performance of our business from period to period by eliminating differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense and income items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. However, our presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies in our industry.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(In millions)  

Reconciliation of Debt to Net debt  

Net debt, or outstanding debt obligations less cash and cash equivalents, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses net debt as a measure of the Company’s outstanding debt obligations that would not be readily satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reconciliation of Costs incurred and GTP capital investments to Oil and gas capital investment  

Management believes the presentation of oil and gas capital investments is useful for investors to assess Apache’s expenditures related to our oil and gas capital activity. We define oil and gas capital investments as costs incurred for oil and gas activities and GTP activities, adjusted to exclude asset retirement obligations revisions and liabilities incurred, while including amounts paid during the period for abandonment and decommissioning expenditures. Capital expenditures attributable to a one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt are also excluded. Management believes this provides a more accurate reflection of Apache’s cash expenditures related to oil and gas capital activity and is consistent with how we plan our capital budget.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to cash flows from continuing operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities  

Cash flows from continuing operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities is a non-GAAP financial measure. Apache uses it internally and provides the information because management believes it is useful for investors and widely accepted by those following the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of a company’s ability to generate cash to internally fund exploration and development activities, fund dividend programs, and service debt. It is also used by research analysts to value and compare oil and gas exploration and production companies and is frequently included in published research when providing investment recommendations. Cash flows from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities, therefore, is an additional measure of liquidity but is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities.
