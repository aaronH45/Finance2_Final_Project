Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. 

In response to numerous investor questions regarding its press release issued January 16, 2018 providing an update on its Card Services segment that reported a December 2017 year over year increase in average receivables of 10% to $17.77 billion, Alliance Data Systems Corporation is providing the following additional information. Excluding the December 2017 sale of two non-core credit card portfolios totaling approximately $800 million in average receivables, the year over year increase in average receivables would have been 15%. These sales had a temporary negative impact to December 2017 and our guidance for receivables growth in 2018 remains 15%. 

The information contained in this report shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
