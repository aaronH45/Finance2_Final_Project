[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses exclude acquisition-related, up-front collaboration, stock-based compensation and other expenses. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided in the tables on pages 8, 9 and 10.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016:

•R&D expenses decreased primarily due to the 2016 impacts of ongoing milestone payments and an impairment charge related to in-process R&D (IPR&D), partially offset by Gilead’s purchase of Cell Design Labs, Inc. (Cell Design Labs) in 2017.

•Non-GAAP R&D expenses* decreased primarily due to the 2016 impact of ongoing milestone payments.

•SG&A expenses increased primarily due to acquisition-related costs associated with Gilead’s acquisition of Kite Pharma, Inc. (Kite).

February 6, 2018 3

For 2017 compared to 2016:

•R&D expenses decreased primarily due to the 2016 impacts of impairment charges related to IPR&D, ongoing milestone payments, up-front collaboration expenses related to Gilead’s license and collaboration agreement with Galapagos NV and Gilead’s purchase of Nimbus Apollo, Inc., partially offset by Gilead’s purchase of Cell Design Labs in 2017.

•Non-GAAP R&D expenses* decreased primarily due to the 2016 impact of ongoing milestone payments.

•SG&A expenses increased primarily due to acquisition-related costs associated with Gilead’s acquisition of Kite.

•Non-GAAP SG&A expenses* increased primarily due to higher branded prescription drug fee expense.

Provision for Income Taxes and Tax Reform

Provision for income taxes was $6.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $821 million for the same period in 2016 and $8.9 billion for the full year 2017 compared to $3.6 billion in 2016. The increases were primarily due to an estimated charge of $5.5 billion from Tax Reform, which was enacted on December 22, 2017 and lowers U.S. corporate income tax rates as of January 1, 2018, implements a territorial tax system and imposes a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. This estimate is provisional and based on our initial analysis and current interpretation. Given the complexity of the legislation, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury, and the potential for additional guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or the Financial Accounting Standards Board, this estimate may be adjusted during 2018. 

Non-GAAP provision for income taxes excludes the estimated charge of $5.5 billion from Tax Reform. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided in the tables on pages 8, 9 and 10.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

As of December 31, 2017, Gilead had $36.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to $32.4 billion as of December 31, 2016. During 2017, Gilead generated $11.9 billion in operating cash flow and in connection with the acquisition of Kite, Gilead issued $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of term loan facilities, of which $1.5 billion was repaid in December 2017.

Product & Pipeline Updates announced by Gilead during the Fourth Quarter of 2017 include:

HIV and Liver Diseases Programs

•Presented data at The Liver Meeting® 2017 which included the announcement of:

◦Results from a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating two doses of GS-0976, an oral, investigational inhibitor of Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The data demonstrate that the higher dose of GS-0976 (20 mg taken orally once daily) when administered for 12 weeks was associated with statistically significant reductions in hepatic steatosis (buildup of fat in the liver) and a noninvasive marker of fibrosis compared to placebo.

◦Results from an open-label Phase 2 study evaluating once-daily Harvoni for 12 weeks among HCV genotype 1 patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min). 100 percent of patients achieved a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after completing therapy (SVR12), including patients with compensated cirrhosis and those who had failed prior treatment.

◦Results from an open-label Phase 2 study evaluating once-daily Epclusa for 12 weeks among 79 liver transplant patients with genotype 1-4 chronic HCV infection. Treatment with Epclusa resulted in an overall SVR12 rate of 96 percent, including patients with cirrhosis and prior treatment failure, and was well tolerated.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Announced detailed 48-week results from a Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of switching virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected adult patients from a multi-tablet regimen containing a boosted protease inhibitor (bPI) to a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (50 mg) (BIC), a novel investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (200/25 mg) (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone. In the ongoing study, BIC/FTC/TAF was found to be statistically non-inferior to regimens containing bPIs and demonstrated no treatment-emergent resistance at 48 weeks. The data were presented at IDWeek 2017.

•Announced a new licensing agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), a United Nations-backed public health organization, to expand access to BIC upon regulatory approval in the United States. Through this agreement, MPP can sub-license rights to BIC to generic drug companies in India, China and South Africa to manufacture therapies containing BIC for distribution in 116 low- and middle-income countries.

Oncology and Cell Therapy Programs

•Announced updated results from the ongoing Phase 1/2 ZUMA-3 study of KTE-C19, a CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell therapy, which is investigational, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). With a minimum of eight weeks of follow-up, 71 percent of ALL patients (n=17/24) who received a single infusion of KTE-C19 achieved complete tumor remission (complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematological recovery). The ZUMA-3 study results were presented in an oral session at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology.

•Announced long-term follow-up data from the ZUMA-1 study of Yescarta™ (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. With a minimum follow-up of one year after a single infusion of Yescarta (median follow-up of 15.4 months), 42 percent of patients continued to respond to therapy, including 40 percent with a complete remission. Detailed results from this updated analysis were simultaneously presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology, and published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

•Announced that U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted regular approval to Yescarta, the first CAR T cell therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma (transformed follicular lymphoma).

These risks and uncertainties include: Gilead’s ability to achieve its anticipated full year 2018 financial results; Gilead’s ability to sustain growth in revenues for its antiviral and other programs; the risk that private and public payers may be reluctant to provide, or continue to provide, coverage or reimbursement for new products, including Vosevi, Yescarta, Epclusa, Harvoni, Genvoya, Odefsey, Descovy and Vemlidy; austerity measures in European countries that may increase the amount of discount required on Gilead’s products; an increase in discounts, chargebacks and rebates due to ongoing contracts and future negotiations with commercial and government payers; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments and geographic regions and decreases in treatment duration; availability of funding for state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs); continued fluctuations in ADAP purchases driven by federal and state grant cycles which may not mirror patient demand and may cause fluctuations in Gilead’s earnings; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic versions of Viread and Truvada outside the United States, an uncertain
