 Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

On January 5, 2018, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (the “Company”) issued a press release discussing the impact on the Company of the enactment on December 22, 2017 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Legislation”), the full text of which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The Company estimates, based on currently available information, that the Tax Legislation will benefit the Company by reducing its recurring effective tax rate beginning in 2018 by approximately 750-850 basis points. The Company also estimates that the enactment of the Tax Legislation will result in a one-time reduction of approximately $35 million - $45 million in the Company’s earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, due to the deemed repatriation of the Company’s foreign profits, net of the remeasurement of U.S. deferred taxes at the lower enacted corporate tax rate and other adjustments. 

The impact of the Tax Legislation may differ from the estimates above, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made, guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Legislation. The Company will continue to analyze the Tax Legislation to determine the full effects of the new law, including the new lower corporate tax rate, on its financial statements and operations. 

The Company will announce financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 on February 1, 2018. 

In accordance with general instructions to Form 8-K, the information in this Form 8-K and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
