2017 Financial Results[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Adjusted EPS of $1.08, compared to guidance of $1.00 to $1.10

ARLINGTON, Va., February 27, 2018 – The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

Full year 2017 Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations (Diluted EPS) was $0.77, a decrease of $0.73 compared to full year 2016, reflecting a one-time non-cash charge on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, resulting from the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the fourth quarter of 2017. This impact was partially offset by lower impairment expense. 

Full year 2017 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure) increased $0.14 to $1.08, primarily driven by higher margins, particularly at the Company's Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean (MCAC) Strategic Business Unit (SBU), and contributions from new businesses, including sPower in the United States. 

Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities for full year 2017 was $2,489 million, a decrease of $395 million compared to full year 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by the large receivables collection in 2016 at Maritza in Bulgaria, which was partially offset by higher margins. Full year 2017 Consolidated Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) decreased $323 million to $1,921 million compared to full year 2016, primarily due to the same drivers as Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities.

"In 2017 we achieved our financial guidance for all metrics and made further progress on our strategic objectives," said Andrés Gluski, AES President and Chief Executive Officer. "We accelerated the transformation of our portfolio by exiting 4.3 GW of merchant coal-fired capacity and acquiring 2.3 GW of long-term contracted renewables earning attractive returns. We also launched Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens, to market our proprietary Advancion energy storage solution in 160 countries. At AES, we are well positioned to deliver sustainable and attractive returns to our shareholders, while reducing our carbon intensity by 50% from 2016 to 2030."

"This year, we will prepay $1 billion in Parent debt, putting us on track to achieve investment grade credit metrics in 2019, one year ahead of our prior plan," said Tom O'Flynn, AES Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "As a result of our recently announced restructuring, we expect to achieve an additional $100 million in annual cost savings, strengthening our ability to deliver on our 8% to 10% average annual growth rate in Adjusted EPS and Parent Free Cash Flow through 2020."

Guidance and Expectations

The Company is issuing 2018 Adjusted EPS guidance of $1.15 to $1.25 and reaffirming its average annual growth rate target of 8% to 10% through 2020. Year-over-year growth in 2018 is primarily driven by contributions from new businesses, cost savings and lower Parent interest.

Adjusted EPS1 Guidance and Expectations

1  A non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for definitions and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.

2 From 2017 Adjusted EPS of $1.08, in line with prior expectation for 8% to 10% average annual growth through 2020 from the mid-point of 2016 Adjusted EPS guidance of $0.95 to $1.05.

The Company will no longer provide guidance for Consolidated Free Cash Flow, as this metric does not accurately reflect the Company's ownership interest in the underlying businesses given the high level of cash flow attributable to noncontrolling interest. The Company believes that Parent Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP financial metric) is the most appropriate metric to reflect its ability to achieve its financial goals, including strengthening its balance sheet and delivering value to shareholders. 

For 2018, the Company expects Parent Free Cash Flow of $600 million to $675 million. Relatively flat expectations for 2018 reflect lower expected distributions from AES Gener, to ensure the maintenance of its investment grade rating, as well as severance payments associated with incremental cost savings. However, the Company expects to achieve higher Parent Free Cash Flow in 2019 and 2020, to deliver 8% to 10% average annual growth in Parent Free Cash Flow through 2020 from the Company's 2017 Parent Free Cash Flow of $637 million. 

The Company's 2018 guidance and expectations through 2020 are based on foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of December 31, 2017.

Strategic Highlights

•In February 2018, the Company announced a reorganization as a part of its on-going strategy to simplify its portfolio and optimize its cost structure.

◦The reorganization will result in an additional $100 million in annual cost savings to be realized through 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded $31 million in restructuring costs associated with these savings. These restructuring costs were excluded from Adjusted EPS.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The Company is establishing a goal to reduce its carbon intensity (tons of carbon dioxide/MWh) by 50% from 2016 to 2030. The Company has already taken steps that are expected to reduce its carbon intensity by 25%, or 20 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions, from 2016 to 2020, including:

◦In 2017, the Company announced the sale or retirement of 4,322 MW of merchant coal-fired generation, representing 37% of the Company's coal-fired capacity.

▪This includes the sales of 1,743 MW in Kazakhstan, 739 MW at DPL in Ohio and 630 MW in the Philippines and the retirement of an additional 1,210 MW at DPL.

◦In 2017, the Company acquired 2,307 MW of renewable generation capacity with long-term contracts in the United States, Brazil and Mexico.

▪This includes 1,445 MW of solar generation, primarily from the 1,145 MW sPower portfolio (US), and 862 MW of wind capacity in Brazil and Mexico.

◦The Company currently has 4,401 MW of capacity under construction and expected to come on-line through 2021.

▪In 2017, completed construction of 279 MW of solar, natural gas and energy storage capacity in the Dominican Republic and the United States.

◦In January 2018, AES and Siemens completed the formation of the Fluence energy storage joint venture.

◦In 2018, sPower signed long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) for 582 MW of solar and wind to be completed in 2019 and 2020.

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTION (PTC) AND ADJUSTED EPS

Adjusted PTC is defined as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to AES excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses and associated benefits and costs due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; and (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations, and office consolidation. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains or losses and associated benefits and costs due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and the tax impact from the repatriation of sales proceeds; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations, and office consolidation; and (g) tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform.

The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to AES. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company and are considered in the Company’s internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests, retire debt or implement restructuring initiatives, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, for Adjusted PTC, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS should not be construed as alternatives to income from continuing operations attributable to AES and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which are determined in accordance with GAAP.

For the year ending December 31, 2017, the Company changed the definition of Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS to exclude (a) associated benefits and costs due to acquisitions, dispositions, and early plant closures; including the tax impact of decisions made at the time of sale to repatriate sales proceeds, and (b) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations, and office consolidation. We further changed the definition of Adjusted EPS to exclude tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform. We believe excluding these benefits and costs better reflect the business performance by removing the variability caused by strategic decisions to dispose or acquire business interests or close plants early, as well as the costs directly associated with a major restructuring program and the impact of the 2017 U.S. tax law reform. The Company has also reflected these changes in the comparative period.

THE AES CORPORATION

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

 (Unaudited)

AES is a holding company that derives its income and cash flows from the activities of its subsidiaries, some of which may not be wholly-owned by the Company. 

The Company's non-GAAP metrics are Consolidated Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Pre-tax Contribution (“Adjusted PTC”) and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (“Adjusted EPS”) used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as investors, industry analysts and lenders.

Consolidated Free Cash Flow (“Free Cash Flow”) is defined as net cash from operating activities (adjusted for service concession asset capital expenditures) less maintenance capital expenditures (including non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures), net of reinsurance proceeds from third parties. The company also excludes environmental capital expenditures that are expected to be recovered through regulatory, contractual or other mechanisms.

The GAAP measure most comparable to Free Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that Free Cash Flow is a useful measure for evaluating our financial condition because it represents the amount of cash generated by the business after the funding of maintenance capital expenditures that may be available for investing in growth opportunities or for repaying debt.

_____________________________

(1) Service concession asset expenditures are included in net cash provided by operating activities, but are excluded from the free cash flow non-GAAP metric.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_____________________________

(1) Subsidiary distributions should not be construed as an alternative to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities which is determined in accordance with GAAP. Subsidiary distributions are important to the Parent Company because the Parent Company is a holding company that does not derive any significant direct revenues from its own activities but instead relies on its subsidiaries’ business activities and the resultant distributions to fund the debt service, investment and other cash needs of the holding company. The reconciliation of the difference between the subsidiary distributions and the Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities consists of cash generated from operating activities that is retained at the subsidiaries for a variety of reasons which are both discretionary and non-discretionary in nature. These factors include, but are not limited to, retention of cash to fund capital expenditures at the subsidiary, cash retention associated with non-recourse debt covenant restrictions and related debt service requirements at the subsidiaries, retention of cash related to sufficiency of local GAAP statutory retained earnings at the subsidiaries, retention of cash for working capital needs at the subsidiaries, and other similar timing differences between when the cash is generated at the subsidiaries and when it reaches the Parent Company and related holding companies.

(2) Parent Company Liquidity is defined as cash at the Parent Company plus available borrowings under existing credit facility plus cash at qualified holding companies (QHCs). AES believes that unconsolidated Parent Company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent Company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES’ indebtedness.

(3) The cash held at QHCs represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US. Such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the Parent Company. Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US. These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the US. Since the cash held by these QHCs is available to the Parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to Parent and QHCs as a useful measure of cash available to the Parent to meet its international liquidity needs.

3 Free Cash Flow is reconciled above. Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash from operating activities (adjusted for service concession asset capital expenditures) less maintenance capital expenditures (including non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures), net of reinsurance proceeds from third parties. The GAAP measure most comparable to Free Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. AES believes that Free Cash Flow is a useful measure for evaluating our financial condition because it represents the amount of cash generated by the business after the funding of maintenance capital expenditures that may be available for investing in growth opportunities or for repaying debt. Free Cash Flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash from operating activities, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.

2018 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE ELEMENTS 1 

1 2018 Guidance is based on expectations for future foreign exchange rates and commodity prices as of December 31, 2017.

2 The Company is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for its Adjusted EPS guidance. In providing its full year 2018 Adjusted EPS guidance, the Company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to: (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains or losses and associated benefits and costs due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and the tax impact of the repatriation of sales proceeds; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; (f) costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations, and office consolidation; and (g) tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform.

3 From 2017 Adjusted EPS of $1.08, in line with prior expectation for 8% to 10% average annual growth through 2020 from the mid-point of 2016 Adjusted EPS guidance of $0.95 to $1.05.
