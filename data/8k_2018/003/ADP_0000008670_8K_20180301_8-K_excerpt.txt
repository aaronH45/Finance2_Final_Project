Item 8.01 Other Events.

On March 1, 2018, Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (the “Company” or “ADP”) announced that it is offering a voluntary early retirement program to certain eligible U.S.-based associates aged 55 or above with 10 years of service. This program excludes senior executive officers and certain other key leaders. This program supports ADP’s ongoing transformation strategy and offers eligible associates an opportunity for enhanced retirement benefits. 

The early retirement offer has been made to about 3,500 eligible associates, or approximately 6 percent of the Company’s workforce, who meet specific age and years-of-service criteria as of June 30, 2018. The effective retirement date for eligible associates who accept the offer will vary, and it is anticipated that all eligible associates who choose to participate in the program will retire by March 31, 2019. 

The total program costs, and the associated savings, will depend upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the number of associates who elect to participate, the mix and seniority of associates that elect to participate, as well as their choice of eligible benefits. Assuming that 35% of the eligible associates choose to participate, ADP expects to recognize certain special termination benefit pre-tax charges of approximately $250 million through the end of fiscal 2019, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, the Company anticipates recording a non-cash settlement charge, which is contingent on the number of participants electing the lump sum payment option and other actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and long-term rate of return on assets. ADP intends to fund a significant majority of the program costs from the existing surplus in ADP’s U.S. defined benefit plan, with the remaining portion of expenses expected to be funded from ADP’s U.S. corporate cash balances. 

The Company expects this initiative to help reduce its pre-tax operating expenses starting in early fiscal 2019, and anticipates, when the program has been fully executed, annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $125 million.
