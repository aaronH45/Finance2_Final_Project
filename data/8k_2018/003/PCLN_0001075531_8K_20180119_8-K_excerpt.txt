Item 5.02.Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangement of Certain Officers

On January 22, 2018, The Priceline Group Inc. (the "Company") announced that it has appointed David Goulden as its Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective as of March 1, 2018. Mr. Goulden, age 58, most recently served as President, Infrastructure Solutions Group at Dell Technologies, a position he held starting in 2016 when Dell acquired EMC Corporation. Mr. Goulden will, as previously announced, be leaving Dell on February 2, 2018. From January 2014 until EMC's acquisition by Dell, Mr. Goulden was Chief Executive Officer of the EMC Information Infrastructure business, EMC's largest business by revenue and employees. Prior to his service in that role, he was President and Chief Operating Officer of EMC, responsible for overseeing engineering and product development, sales and customer operations, services, marketing, and G&A functions, since 2012. Mr. Goulden served as Chief Financial Officer of EMC from 2006 to 2014, responsible for financial operations of EMC's consolidated businesses. Earlier in his career at EMC, Mr. Goulden led the company's Sales and Customer Operations worldwide, including global sales in all theaters as well as global channels, alliances, and partners, and prior to that service he oversaw Marketing and New Business Development at EMC. Prior to joining EMC in 2002, Mr. Goulden served in various capacities at Getronics N.V., an information technology services company, most recently as a member of the Board of Management and President and Chief Operating Officer for the Americas and Asia Pacific. Mr. Goulden served on the board of directors of VMWare, a cloud infrastructure and business mobility company, from 2007 to 2014.

In connection with Mr. Goulden's appointment as the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, he and the Company entered into an employment agreement (the "Employment Agreement") with, among others, the following terms:

•an initial annual base salary of $600,000;

•a target annual bonus of 210% of base salary;

•a grant of restricted stock units on March 4, 2018 for a number of shares with a grant date fair value (as determined under the Company's 1999 Omnibus Plan and its standard grant practices) of $6,300,000;

•a grant of performance share units on March 4, 2018 for a number of shares with a grant date fair value (as determined under the Company's 1999 Omnibus Plan and its standard grant practices) at target of $4,500,000; 

•a signing bonus of $500,000, intended to be used for reasonable and customary moving expenses including temporary rental expenses; and

•in the event of his termination without Cause or his resignation for Good Reason (each as defined in the Employment Agreement), severance benefits including payments equal to one times his base salary and target annual bonus (two times if the termination occurs within 12 months after a Change of Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or, under certain circumstances, within 6 months prior to a Change of Control), a pro rated portion of any earned bonus for the year of termination, health benefits for a period of 12 months, and any earned bonus for a prior completed year that has not yet been paid.

Mr. Goulden's RSU award will vest in three equal annual installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, subject to completion of continuous service from the date of grant until the applicable vesting date, subject to pro rata vesting upon a termination without Cause or upon death or disability or his resignation for Good Reason. Mr. Goulden's PSU award will vest upon completion of three years of continuous service from the date of grant and achievement of the applicable minimum performance metric, subject to pro rata vesting upon a termination without Cause or upon death or disability or his resignation for Good Reason. The awards will be subject to the other terms of the respective award agreements. The specific terms of the PSU award have not yet been determined, but are expected to be substantially similar to prior PSU awards granted by the Company to Company executive officers.

The foregoing summary of the Employment Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the agreement itself, which is attached to this Current Report as Exhibit 99.1 and which is incorporated by reference into this Item 5.02.

In connection with the Employment Agreement, the Company and Mr. Goulden have also entered into a Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement and an Employee Confidentiality and Assignment Agreement, copies of which are attached to this Current Report as Exhibits 99.2 and 99.3, respectively, and which are incorporated by reference into this Item 5.02.
