On January 31, 2018, the Board also approved, to be granted on the Effective Date, a prorated grant of the annual restricted stock unit award granted to non-employee Directors under the Chevron Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan (the “NED Plan.”) The number of restricted stock units to be received by Mr. Umpleby shall be determined by multiplying $225,000 by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the Annual Compensation Cycle (as defined in the NED Plan) beginning on the Effective Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Annual Compensation Cycle, and dividing that product by the closing Chevron common stock price on the Effective Date. Mr. Umpleby will also be entitled to receive the annual cash retainer for non-employee Directors of $150,000, which will be prorated and paid in monthly installments.

The press release announcing Mr. Umpleby’s election to the Board is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
