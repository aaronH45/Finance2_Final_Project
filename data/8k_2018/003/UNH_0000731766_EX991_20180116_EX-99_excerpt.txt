NEW YORK, NY (January 16, 2018) – UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 results reflecting continued broad-based growth and strengthened operating performance across the enterprise. “We enter 2018 with both growth momentum and opportunity, as a result of our focus on improving the experience of those we serve, combined with actions taken to deepen our capabilities and presence in strategic markets,” said David S. Wichmann, chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group.

As a result of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, UnitedHealth Group’s 2017 net earnings of $10.72 per share included a $1.22 per share non-cash benefit from the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax liability. This one-time item affects the comparability of results between periods, and accordingly has been excluded from adjusted net earnings per share.

The Company revised its 2018 financial outlook to reflect the effects of the U.S. corporate tax law changes, dedicating a significant portion of the benefits to accelerating investments in data analytics, technology and innovations to better serve consumers and care systems and to advancing new and existing business platforms. UnitedHealth Group now expects 2018 net earnings of $11.65 to $11.95 per share and adjusted net earnings of $12.30 to $12.60 per share. Cash flows from operations are expected to range from $15 billion to $15.5 billion.

•UnitedHealth Group’s full year 2017 revenues of $201.2 billion grew 8.8 percent or $16.3 billion year-over-year. Revenue growth was broad-based and balanced across the businesses, reflecting strong demand for the Company’s product and service offerings. 

•Full year 2017 earnings from operations grew $2.3 billion, up 17.6 percent year-over-year to $15.2 billion, and adjusted net earnings grew 25.1 percent to $10.07 per share, with fourth quarter adjusted net earnings growing 22.7 percent year-over-year to $2.59 per share.

•Full year 2017 cash flows from operations of $13.6 billion grew 38.8 percent year-over-year and were 1.3 times net earnings, with an increasing mix of cash generated by non-insurance businesses in 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted cash flows from operations were $2 billion.

•The full year 2017 consolidated medical care ratio of 82.1 percent increased 90 basis points year-over-year, as a 140 basis point increase from the health insurance tax deferral was partially offset by $690 million in favorable prior year reserve development in 2017, compared to $220 million in 2016. The fourth quarter 2017 consolidated medical care ratio of 82.2 percent reflected consistent medical cost trends.

•The full year 2017 operating cost ratio of 14.7 percent declined 70 basis points year-over-year from 15.4 percent in 2016, as a 90 basis point decrease from the health insurance tax deferral was partially offset by business mix.

•Year end 2017 days claims payable of 50 days decreased one day sequentially and year-over-year; 2017 days sales outstanding rose one day sequentially and year-over-year to 17 days due to the mix of health care services revenues.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•UnitedHealthcare’s full year 2017 revenues of $163.3 billion grew $14.7 billion or 9.9 percent year-over-year. In 2017, UnitedHealthcare grew to serve 2 million more people across domestic employer-sponsored, Medicare and Medicaid benefit offerings. UnitedHealthcare grew to serve 480,000 more consumers in the fourth quarter of 2017, helping lift revenues by 9.6 percent year-over-year to $41.6 billion. Full year 2017 earnings from operations of $8.5 billion grew 16.3 percent, driven by diversified revenue growth and improved operating performance. Fourth quarter 2017 earnings from operations of $1.8 billion were ahead of the Company’s outlook, due to strong business growth and increased reserve development. Comparisons of 2017 results with those of 2016 are affected by the health insurance tax deferral and a $350 million industry guarantee assessment in fourth quarter 2016.

–UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual served nearly 30 million people at December 31, 2017. Full year 2017 revenues of $52.1 billion decreased $1 billion year-over-year, including nearly $200 million in the fourth quarter, due to the effects of the ACA Individual market withdrawals and health insurance tax deferral. These factors offset revenue increases from strong year-over-year growth of 465,000 people in commercial risk-based group benefit offerings, including 130,000 people in the fourth quarter.

–UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement served nearly 9 million people with medical benefit products at year end 2017, reflecting growth of 12.4 percent or approximately 1 million people. Growth was diversified, reflecting a balanced mix in Medicare Advantage, including serving more people in both the individual market and the employer-sponsored group retiree market, and through Medicare Supplement. Revenues grew by $9.7 billion or 17.2 percent to $66 billion in 2017, including growth of 16.7 percent to $16.4 billion in the fourth quarter.

–In 2017, UnitedHealthcare Community & State grew to serve 6.7 million people across 28 state customers and the District of Columbia. Full year growth of 815,000 people, or 13.8 percent, included serving 330,000 more people in the fourth quarter. Revenues of $37.4 billion grew $4.5 billion or 13.7 percent year-over-year, with fourth quarter revenues increasing 15 percent, reflecting strong membership gains in 2017.

–UnitedHealthcare Global served 4.1 million people at December 31, 2017. Revenues of $7.8 billion grew 24.6 percent, with fourth quarter revenues of $2 billion increasing 11.7 percent year-over-year. Revenue growth was driven by disciplined pricing, the full year impact of 2016 acquisitions and an improved currency exchange rate. Performance strengthened in 2017 as a result of pricing actions and advancements in clinical integration, as well as improvements in operating costs.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted net earnings per share, adjusted cash flows from operations and net margin adjusted for tax reform are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

Adjusted net earnings per share excludes from the relevant GAAP metric, as applicable, intangible amortization and other items, if any, that do not relate to the Company's underlying business performance. Management believes that the use of adjusted net earnings per share provides investors and management useful information about the earnings impact of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. In addition, adjusted net earnings per share excludes the earnings impact of the deferred tax revaluation recognized after The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted in December 2017 and the recognition of the Company's estimated share of guaranty association assessments resulting from the liquidation of Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary (Penn Treaty). Management believes the exclusion of these items provides a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance from period to period.

Management believes that the use of net margin adjusted for tax reform provides investors and management useful information about the performance of the underlying business prior to the impact of the deferred tax revaluation recognized in 2017.

Management believes that the use of adjusted cash flows from operations provides investors and management with useful information to compare our cash flows from operations for the current period to that of other periods, when the Company does not receive its monthly payment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the applicable quarter. CMS generally remits their monthly payments on the first calendar day of the applicable month. However, if the first calendar day of the month falls on a weekend or a holiday, CMS has typically paid the Company on the last business day of the preceding calendar month. As such, quarterly operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP may occasionally include CMS premium payments for two months or four months. Adjusted cash flows from operating activities presents operating cash flows assuming all CMS payments were received on the first calendar day of the applicable month. 

Management believes that the use of EBITDA provides investors and management useful information about our operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
