        "revisions to existing regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts are issued frequently; in fact, both technical corrections legislation and administrative guidance may someday be enacted or promulgated in response to the substantial December 2017 amendments to the IRC. In general, changes in law or interpretation could have a more significant impact on us as compared to other REITs due to the nature of our business and our substantial use of TRSs, particularly foreign TRSs. Likewise, the rules regarding taxes other than United States federal income taxes may also be modified. No prediction can be made as to the likelihood of passage of new tax legislation or other provisions, or the direct or indirect effect on us and our stockholders. Revisions to tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect our ability to qualify and be taxed as a REIT, as well as the tax or other consequences of an investment in our stock. We and our stockholders may also be subject to taxation by state, local or other jurisdictions, including those in which we or our stockholders transact business or reside. These tax consequences may not be comparable to the United States federal income tax consequences described above."
