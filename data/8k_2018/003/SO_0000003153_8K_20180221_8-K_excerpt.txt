On February 21, 2018, The Southern Company (“Southern Company”) issued a press release regarding its earnings for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Exhibits 99.01, 99.02, 99.03 and 99.04 to this Current Report on Form 8-K include earnings and earnings per share in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. These exhibits also include earnings and earnings per share (1) excluding (a) charges for estimated losses relating to Mississippi Power Company’s integrated coal gasification combined cycle construction project in Kemper County, Mississippi (the “Kemper IGCC”), (b) costs related to the acquisition and integration of Southern Company Gas, and (c) earnings from the Wholesale Gas Services business of Southern Company Gas, for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016; (2) excluding charges for a write-down of Gulf Power Company’s ownership of Plant Scherer Unit 3 for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017; (3) excluding additional equity return as a result of the Kemper IGCC 

schedule extension from August 31, 2016 through the project’s suspension in June 2017 for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 and the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2016; (4) excluding costs relating to the pending dispositions of Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017; and (5) excluding the net tax benefit as a result of federal tax reform legislation for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017. The attached exhibits include additional information regarding these excluded items, as well as reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable financial measure under GAAP. Southern Company believes the presentation of earnings and earnings per share, excluding these items, is useful to investors because it provides investors with additional information to evaluate the performance of Southern Company’s ongoing business activities. Southern Company management also uses earnings and earnings per share, excluding the effect of these items, to evaluate the performance of Southern Company’s ongoing business activities. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
