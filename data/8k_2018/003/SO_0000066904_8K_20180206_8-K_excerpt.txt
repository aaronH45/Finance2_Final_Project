Item 8.01.Other Matters.

On February 6, 2018, the Mississippi Public Service Commission (“PSC”) voted to approve a settlement agreement relating to cost recovery for the Kemper County energy facility (the “Kemper Facility”) among Mississippi Power Company (“Mississippi Power”), the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff, and certain intervenors (as approved, the “Kemper Settlement Agreement”). The Kemper Settlement Agreement provides for an annual revenue requirement of approximately $99.3 million for costs related to the Kemper Facility, which reflects a reduction from the proposed $112.6 million, solely to account for the impact of federal tax reform legislation adopted in December 2017. The revenue requirement is based on (1) a fixed return on equity (“ROE”) for 2018 of 8.6% excluding any performance adjustment, (2) a ROE for 2019 calculated in accordance with Mississippi Power’s Performance Evaluation Plan (“PEP”), excluding the performance adjustment, (3) for future years, a performance-based ROE calculated pursuant to PEP, and (4) amortization periods for the related regulatory assets and liabilities of eight years and six years, respectively. As previously disclosed, the revenue requirement also reflects a disallowance related to a portion of Mississippi Power’s investment in the Kemper Facility requested for inclusion in rate base, which The Southern Company and Mississippi Power recorded in the fourth quarter 2017 as an additional charge to income of approximately $78 million ($85 million net of accumulated depreciation of $7 million) pre-tax ($48 million after tax).

Under the Kemper Settlement Agreement, retail customer rates will reflect a reduction of approximately $26.8 million annually, with no recovery for costs associated with the gasifier portion of the Kemper Facility in 2018 or at any future date. Mississippi Power will make a compliance rate filing with the Mississippi PSC within 30 days. In addition, (1) the certificate of public convenience and necessity for the Kemper Facility will be modified to limit the Kemper Facility to natural gas combined cycle operation and (2) 

Mississippi Power will be required to file a reserve margin plan with the Mississippi PSC by August 2018.
