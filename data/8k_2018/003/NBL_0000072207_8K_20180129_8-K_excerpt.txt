Item 5.02.Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. 

On January 29, 2018, the Compensation, Benefits and Stock Option Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Noble Energy, Inc. (the “Company”) approved additional forms of awards that will govern certain future grants under the Company’s 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”). These new forms reflect two additional vesting schedules for restricted stock awards. 

In prior years, the Company’s executive officers received time-based restricted stock awards that vested 40% on the first anniversary and 60% on the second anniversary. The Compensation Committee considered and approved a new structure for these awards for executive officers (and certain other Company officers) beginning in 2018, which will now include shares of restricted stock awards that vest one-third per year on the first, second and third anniversary of the Award date. 

The Compensation Committee also approved a three-year cliff vested restricted stock award to be used from time to time as determined by the Company.

The foregoing descriptions of the new forms of restricted stock awards are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of these agreements, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
