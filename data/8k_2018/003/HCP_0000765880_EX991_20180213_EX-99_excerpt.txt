SAME PROPERTY PORTFOLIO OPERATING SUMMARY 

The table below outlines the same property portfolio operating results for the quarter and full year: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]_______________________________________ 

(1)Total SPP Cash NOI represents SPP Cash NOI plus our pro rata share of Cash NOI from our unconsolidated joint ventures. See “December 31, 2017 Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for definition, discussion of its uses and inherent limitations, and reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP on the Investor Relations section of our website at http://ir.hcpi.com/financial-reconciliation. 

(2)The fourth quarter 2017 SHOP Total SPP Cash NOI growth rate was impacted by: (i) outsized volume purchase rebates recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 (3.0%); (ii) a portfolio of recently acquired and transitioned assets entering the SPP pool in fourth quarter 2017 prior to reaching stabilized occupancy (2.8%); (iii) an increase in sales and marketing expenses in fourth quarter 2017 to catch up from lower spend during the first half of 2017 and to better position the portfolio for 2018 (2.3%); and (iv) under-accrual by an operator of a utility bill which was provisioned for in fourth quarter 2017 (1.0%). Adjusting for these items, normalized fourth quarter 2017 SHOP Total SPP Cash NOI growth would be 0.8%. 

(3)Other primarily includes our hospitals and U.K. real estate investments.  

BROOKDALE TRANSACTIONS UPDATE 

In December 2017, we closed on the acquisition of Brookdale’s 10% interest in the RIDEA III joint venture for $32 million. We anticipate closing on both the purchase of Brookdale’s 10% interest in the RIDEA I joint venture for $63 million and the sale of six assets to Brookdale for $275 million near the end of the first quarter 2018. 

We continue to expect the sale of our remaining 40% interest in the RIDEA II joint venture to Columbia Pacific Advisors LLC ("CPA") for $332 million to close mid-2018. 

In addition, we are in the process of selling or transitioning 36 senior housing operating properties and 32 triple-net leased communities currently operated by Brookdale. 

Upon completion, these transactions will significantly reduce our Brookdale concentration, improve lease coverage of our remaining triple-net assets leased to Brookdale, increase tenant diversification in our portfolio, and enhance our balance sheet and credit profile.

DEVELOPMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS  

THE COVE AND SIERRA POINT LIFE SCIENCE DEVELOPMENT UPDATE

During 2017, we placed $200 million of development in service at The Cove, our premier $720 million, class-A life science development project in South San Francisco. With Phases I & II of The Cove fully-leased, and strong interest in Phase III of the project, we recently commenced Sierra Point, our next life science development in the South San Francisco market. 

Sierra Point is a 600,000 square foot multi-building campus designed to be developed in phases as demand dictates. Phase I will consist of approximately 215,000 square feet with an estimated cost of $220 million and an initial delivery expected in late 2019. 

We are the largest life science landlord in South San Francisco with over three million square feet. HCP and its predecessor company have successfully delivered numerous life science developments in South San Francisco since the mid-1990s.

620 TERRY PARTICIPATING DEVELOPMENT FINANCING

In December, we entered into a participating debt financing arrangement with CPA to fund the construction of 620 Terry, a $147 million, 243-unit urban senior living development located in the First Hill neighborhood of Downtown Seattle. We will provide a participating development loan of up to $115 million. Upon expected completion in 2019, 620 Terry will be operated by Leisure Care, LLC, a leading senior housing operator, and offer a mix of independent-living, assisted-living, and memory care units.

ACQUISITIONS   

For the fourth quarter, we announced $424 million of acquisitions, bringing our year-to-date total acquisitions to $562 million. Significant transactions during the quarter included: 

In November, we acquired The Residence at Watertown Square, a 90-unit senior housing community located in the Boston suburb of Watertown, Massachusetts for $45 million. We own the community in a consolidated joint venture with LCB Senior Living, LLC, a leading senior housing developer and operator focused on the New England region. 

In December, we closed on the previously announced $228 million acquisition of the Hayden Research Campus located in the Boston suburb of Lexington. The Hayden acquisition allowed us to enter the Boston life science market with immediate scale and align with a leading local developer, owner and operator, King Street Properties. The 400,000 square foot campus comprises two existing buildings leased to major life science anchor tenants, including subsidiaries of Shire plc and Merck & Co., Inc. Additionally, King Street is currently seeking approvals for the joint venture to develop 209,000 square feet of life science space on the campus. The acquisition complements our sizable San Francisco and San Diego life science portfolios and provides us with an additional market for investment opportunity over time. 

In December, we acquired 11 off-campus medical office buildings for $151 million. The 378,000 square foot portfolio is anchored by leading hospitals and was 97% occupied as of December 31, 2017. The portfolio has a weighted average remaining lease term of eight years and an average building age of eight years. 

TANDEM DEBT INVESTMENT UPDATE 

During our fourth quarter 2017 financial statement close process, we recorded an $84 million impairment on our Tandem debt investment and reduced the carrying value to $105 million. We are actively evaluating and pursuing a range of strategic alternatives from selling our loan position to foreclosing on the collateral. This investment represents our last meaningful exposure to both post-acute/skilled-nursing assets and highly-leveraged mezzanine investments.

BALANCE SHEET UPDATE

As previously announced, in October, we closed on a new $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The new facility reduced our funded interest cost by five basis points and has a maturity date of October 19, 2021, plus two six-month extension options at our discretion. Based on our current senior unsecured long-term debt ratings, the facility bears interest annually at LIBOR plus 100 basis points and has a facility fee of 20 basis points. The facility also includes the ability to increase the commitments by an aggregate amount up to $750 million, subject to securing additional commitments.

At December 31, 2017, we had $1.0 billion of liquidity from a combination of cash and availability under our $2.0 billion credit facility and no major senior notes or secured debt maturities until 2019.

EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP 

As previously announced, Mike McKee will step down from his role as Executive Chairman, effective March 1, 2018, and retire from the Board of Directors at HCP's Annual Meeting. To help facilitate a smooth transition, Mr. McKee will work with the Company in a consulting capacity until HCP's Annual Meeting. 

Dave Henry, previously the Lead Independent Director, has been appointed to serve as non-executive Chairman. 

DIVIDEND 

On February 1, 2018, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.37 per common share. The dividend will be paid on March 2, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 15, 2018. A copy of the press release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at http://ir.hcpi.com.
