Item 7.01   

Regulation FD Disclosure   

ExxonMobil wishes to notify investors that its upcoming earnings report will reflect a change in the form of presentation of certain line items. Specifically, effective December 31, 2017, the Corporation revised its accounting policy election related to the reporting of sales, excise and value-added taxes assessed on our customers related to sales transactions (“sales-based taxes”) from gross reporting (included in both “Sales and other operating revenue” and “Sales-based taxes”) to the preferable method of net reporting (excluded from both “Sales and other operating revenue” and “Sales-based taxes”) in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The revised election makes reported revenue more consistent with ExxonMobil’s role as an agent for the government collecting taxes assessed on customers and is more consistent with the reporting practices of other international major oil and gas companies as well as the largest U.S. companies. This change in accounting principle was applied retrospectively and does not affect net income attributable to ExxonMobil. 

Also effective December 31, 2017, the Corporation reclassified U.S. Federal excise tax from “Sales-based taxes” to “Other taxes and duties”. These taxes are not considered to be assessed on our customers and will continue to be reported gross. The amount reclassified was $3,110 million in 2016 and $3,044 million in 2015. This change in classification was applied retrospectively and does not affect net income attributable to ExxonMobil.
