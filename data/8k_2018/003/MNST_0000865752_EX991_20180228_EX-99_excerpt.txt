Fourth Quarter Results 

Net sales for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 7.5 percent to $810.4 million from $753.8 million in the same period last year. Gross sales for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 10.1 percent to $934.8 million from $848.8 million for the same period last year. Favorable currency exchange rates increased net sales by approximately $7.3 million and gross sales by approximately $9.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter. Net sales and gross sales in the 2017 fourth quarter were adversely affected by inventory reductions by certain of our international distributors. The Company estimates that net sales in the 2017 fourth quarter were adversely affected by approximately 2 percent due to such reductions. 

Net sales for the Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment, which is comprised of the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks, Monster Hydro® energy drinks and Mutant® Super Soda drinks, increased 7.6 percent to $736.1 million for the 2017 fourth quarter, from $684.4 million for the same period last year. Net sales for the Company’s Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company, increased 7.8 percent to $69.6 million for the 2017 fourth quarter, from $64.5 million in the comparable 2016 quarter.

Net sales to customers outside the United States increased 8.7 percent to $210.4 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, from $193.5 million in the corresponding quarter last year. 

Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, for the 2017 fourth quarter was 62.1 percent as compared to 66.1 percent in the 2016 fourth quarter, primarily attributable to sales mix, inventory reserves in China, lower allowances as a percentage of sales in the 2016 fourth quarter, as well as to increases in certain other costs. 

Operating expenses for the 2017 fourth quarter were $236.5 million, compared with $246.4 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. The comparable 2016 fourth quarter operating expenses included distributor termination expenses of $46.3 million. 

Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.6 percent for the 2017 fourth quarter, compared with 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter last year. 

Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2017 fourth quarter were 13.6 percent, compared with 12.0 percent in the fourth quarter last year. 

General and administrative expenses for the 2017 fourth quarter were $96.7 million, or 11.9 percent of net sales, compared with $132.2 million, or 17.5 percent of net sales, for the 2016 fourth quarter. General and administrative expenses for the comparable 2016 fourth quarter, excluding distributor terminations of $46.3 million, were $85.8 million, or 11.4 percent of net sales.

Operating income for the 2017 fourth quarter increased to $267.1 million from $251.7 million in the comparable quarter last year. 

The effective tax rate for the 2017 fourth quarter was 24.8 percent, compared with 29.9 percent in the same period last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase of $69.2 million in the stock compensation deduction related to excess tax benefits that are recorded in net income. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a provisional charge of $39.8 million related to the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 and a $2.1 million charge for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 earnings and profits, as a result of the Tax Reform Act signed into law on December 22, 2017. 

Net income for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 16.4 percent to $201.3 million from $172.9 million in the comparable quarter last year. Net income per diluted share for the 2017 fourth quarter increased 17.5 percent to $0.35 from $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Measures 

Gross sales is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the disclosure of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.
