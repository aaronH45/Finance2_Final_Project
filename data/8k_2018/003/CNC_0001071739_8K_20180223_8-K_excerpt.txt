Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

On February 23, 2018, Centene Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Centene”), MHM Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“MHM”), and certain other parties entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, MHM will be merged into a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Centene.

In the transaction, each outstanding share of common stock of MHM, par value $0.01 per share, subject to certain exceptions, will be converted into the right to receive the per-share portion of the merger consideration. The merger consideration includes $178,500,000 in shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Centene (“Centene Common Stock”). The number of shares of Centene Common Stock issued will be based on the volume weighted average of the sale prices per share of Centene Common Stock for the ten trading days before the closing of the transaction. Assuming a volume weighted average price of $100.45, the closing price of Centene Common Stock on February 23, 2018, Centene would issue approximately 1,777,003 shares of Centene Common Stock as partial merger consideration. The exact number of shares issued may be higher or lower. 

All shares of Centene Common Stock to be issued in the transaction will be issued to former stockholders of MHM pursuant to an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Each former stockholder of MHM receiving Centene Common Stock will make certain representations and warranties to Centene regarding, among other things, whether it is an accredited investor and its investment intent. 

Item 8.01 Other Events. 

On February 26, 2018, Centene issued a press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement. A copy of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
