ENVISION HEALTHCARE REPORTS 2017 FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS

INTRODUCES 2018 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE 

Review of Strategic Alternatives is Ongoing

NASHVILLE, Tenn. - (February 27, 2018) - Envision Healthcare Corporation (“Envision”) (NYSE: EVHC) today reported financial results for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, that exceeded its most recent Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted earnings per share guidance. 

Highlights for the fourth quarter of 2017 include: 

•Net revenue from continuing operations of $2.00 billion;

•Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders of $137.8 million or $1.13 per diluted share; 

•Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations of $71.9 million, or $0.59 per diluted share; 

•Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $211.4 million; and 

•Net cash flow from operations, less distributions to non-controlling interests and excluding transaction costs, of $210.9 million. 

Envision’s net earnings from continuing operations for the 2017 fourth quarter were impacted by several factors, including a net benefit of approximately $600 million from a reduction of deferred tax liabilities as a result of changes made by the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as a non-cash impairment charge of $500 million related to the fair value of goodwill in its Physician Services segment following its annual goodwill impairment test. 

A reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial results to the comparable GAAP measure is provided on page 6 of this press release. 

“We’re pleased to report results for the fourth quarter of 2017 that were above the high end of our most recent guided range,” said Christopher A. Holden, President and Chief Executive Officer of Envision Healthcare Corporation. “During the last several months, our management team launched a number of new initiatives driving performance through a combination of efficiencies and cost reductions. Our fourth quarter results include some initial benefit from those actions, and we expect continued operational improvements throughout 2018 and into 2019.” 

Reporting Segments 

Envision reports two operating segments as continuing operations: Physician Services, which includes facility-based and post-acute services, and Ambulatory Services. On August 7, 2017, Envision entered into a definitive agreement to divest American Medical Response (“AMR”), Envision’s Medical Transportation business, which was moved to discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2017. As required by accounting guidelines, Envision re-allocated certain corporate

expenses associated with its shared services model to continuing operations. This re-allocation reduced Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations by $7.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, consisting of a reduction of $5.7 million for Physician Services and $1.7 million for Ambulatory Services, with a corresponding Adjusted EBITDA increase of $7.4 million for discontinued operations. Upon completion of the pending divestiture of the Medical Transportation business, a substantial portion of these shared services expenses are likely to remain with that business. 

Physician Services 

In order to enhance the comparability of results following the merger of AMSURG Corp. (“AMSURG”) and Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (“EHH”), which was completed on December 1, 2016, the following discussion presents Envision Physician Services’ results for 2016 as if the two separate Physician Services’ segments of AMSURG and EHH, based on historically reported results, had been combined effective January 1, 2016. 

Net revenues for Physician Services were $1.67 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 8.3% from $1.54 billion during the prior-year period. Revenue growth was driven by contributions from acquisitions of 8.6% and from same contracts of 0.4%, which were partially offset by net contract terminations of 0.7%, due to the population health contract terminated effective December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of that contract, new Physician Services’ contracts contributed net revenue growth of 1.6%, which consisted of revenue growth from new contract additions of 7.6%, partially offset by contract terminations of 6.0%. 

Net revenue on a same-contract base, grew by 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017, or by 1.4% when excluding the impact of Evolution Health when compared to the prior-year period. Same-contract patient encounters grew by 2.7%, while same-contract revenue per patient encounter declined by 2.2% for the segment, or by 1.3% when excluding Evolution Health. Rate for anesthesia and surgical services lines declined slightly, though anesthesia rate performed better than expected. The change in anesthesia rate was impacted by an unfavorable prior-year comparison. 

For the fourth quarter of 2017, Physician Services Adjusted EBITDA was $133.1 million, or $138.8 million when excluding the corporate expense re-allocation of $5.7 million. Physician Services results were negatively impacted by higher-than-anticipated malpractice expense of $7.0 million related to prior-year claims development. 

Ambulatory Services 

Net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $333.1 million, which compares to $326.7 million for the prior-year period. 

Same-center revenue increased 2.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017 due to procedure volume growth of 2.8%, offset by a decline in net revenue per procedure of 0.1%. Surgery centers deconsolidated in the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, contributed incremental revenues of $6.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $78.3 million, or $80.0 million when excluding the corporate expense re-allocation of $1.7 million. This compares with $63.6 million for the prior-year period. Ambulatory Services’ Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by the recognition of a favorable $7.7 million legal settlement of a dispute that occurred prior to 2017. When excluding the benefit from the settlement and corporate expense re-allocation, which had a 230-basis point impact on margin, Adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.7%, an increase of approximately 220 basis points from the prior-year period. 

Liquidity 

Envision had cash and cash equivalents of $352.2 million at December 31, 2017, which includes $40.0 million of cash attributable to its Medical Transportation business. The Company has no amounts outstanding under its asset-based lending facility as of December 31, 2017. During 2017, Envision invested $757.8 million in acquisitions. 

Net cash flows from operations, less distributions to noncontrolling interests and excluding transaction costs, were $210.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company’s ratio of total net debt at December 31, 2017, to trailing 12 months

February 27, 2018  

EBITDA, as defined under the Company’s credit agreement, was 4.6 times. Interest expense reflects a re-allocation of $21.8 million to discontinued operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017. 

Discontinued Operations

Net revenues from discontinued operations were $648.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $98.0 million, or $90.6 million when excluding the favorable impact of $7.4 million from the re-allocation of corporate expenses. 

While Envision continues to expect that the divestiture of AMR will be completed during the first quarter of 2018, and that it will use net proceeds to reduce debt, the pending divestiture of AMR remains subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Envision has responded to a second request from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) asking for further information related to the transaction, and the buyer has agreed to divestiture remedies to address certain concerns raised by the FTC. 

Guidance 

Envision today introduced its financial and operating guidance for 2018 and the first quarter of the year, as follows: 

•Net revenues of $8.35 billion to $8.53 billion; 

•Combined total organic growth for Envision, including same-contract and net new Physician Services’ contract growth of 2% to 5%;

◦Same-contract revenue growth for Physician Services of 1% to 3%; 

◦Same-center revenue growth for Ambulatory Services of 1% to 2%; 

•Free-cash flow to fund accretive acquisitions;

•Adjusted EBITDA of $960 million to $1.00 billion; and

•Adjusted EPS for 2018 of $3.46 to $3.70. 

For the first quarter of 2018, Envision expects Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to be $195 million to $205 million, and Adjusted EPS of $0.61 to $0.67, which includes the expected impact of seasonally higher payroll tax expenses in Physician Services.

Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year and first quarter of 2018 excludes interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, impairment charges, debt extinguishment costs, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, changes in contingent purchase price consideration, purchase accounting adjustments related to mergers and acquisitions, gain or loss on deconsolidations and discontinued operations. Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS guidance for the full year and first quarter of 2018 excludes acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, acquisition-related amortization expense, gains and losses on deconsolidation transactions, share-based compensation, impairment charges, the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and debt extinguishment costs, net of tax impact. Envision is not providing a reconciliation of its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS guidance because the exact amount of such exclusions is not currently determinable, including variability and timing associated with acquisitions, disposals, deconsolidations and impairment charges. These amounts may be significant and may vary significantly from period to period (see page 6 for a reconciliation of all historical GAAP and non-GAAP financial results presented in this release). 

Ongoing Strategic Review 

Envision’s Board of Directors is continuing to conduct a full review of a broad range of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value.

“Our Board is considering a number of options to create shareholder value, including execution of our strategic plan, portfolio rationalization, and a potential sale of the Company,” said Denny Shelton, Lead Independent Director of Envision’s Board. “We remain fully engaged in a comprehensive review of our options.”

Footnotes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to GAAP Measures

(1) We believe the calculation of adjusted net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share attributable to common stockholders provides a better measure of our ongoing performance and provides better comparability to prior periods because it excludes discontinued operations, the gains or loss from deconsolidations, net of noncontrolling interests, which are non-cash in nature, impairment charges, transaction and integration costs, including associated debt extinguishment costs and deferred financing write-off, and acquisition-related amortization expense, changes in contingent purchase price consideration, purchase accounting adjustments related to mergers and acquisitions, the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and share-based compensation expense. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share attributable to common stockholders should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and the items excluded from it is a significant component in understanding and assessing financial performance. Because adjusted net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share attributable to common stockholders is not a measurement determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, it may not be comparable as presented to other similarly titled measures of other companies. For purposes of calculating adjusted earnings per share, we utilize the if-converted method to determine the number of diluted shares outstanding. In periods where utilizing the if-converted method is anti-dilutive, the mandatory convertible preferred stock will not be included in the calculation of diluted shares outstanding.

(2) We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, net, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, transaction and integration costs, share-based compensation, impairment charges, debt extinguishment costs, gain or loss on deconsolidations, net of noncontrolling interests, changes in contingent purchase price consideration, purchase accounting adjustments related to mergers and acquisitions, the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and acquisitions and discontinued operations. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is an analytical indicator used by management and the health care industry to evaluate company performance, allocate resources and measure leverage. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings, cash flows from operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is most comparable to Adjusted EBITDA, as defined.
