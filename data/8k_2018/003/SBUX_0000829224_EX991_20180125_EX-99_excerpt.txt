First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Summary

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Consolidated net revenues grew 6% over Q1 FY17 to $6.1 billion in Q1 FY18, primarily driven by incremental revenues from the opening of 2,305 net new stores over the past 12 months and a 2% growth in global comparable store sales.

Consolidated operating income declined 1% to $1,116.1 million in Q1 FY18, down from $1,132.6 million in Q1 FY17. Consolidated operating margin declined 140 basis points to 18.4%, primarily due to food-related mix shift in the Americas, as well as restructuring costs related to the company's ongoing efforts to streamline business operations.

Q1 Americas Segment Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net revenues for the Americas segment grew 7% over Q1 FY17 to $4.3 billion in Q1 FY18, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 979 net new store openings over the past 12 months and a 2% growth in comparable store sales.

Operating income of $979.4 million in Q1 FY18 grew 2% versus $958.5 million in Q1 FY17. Operating margin of 23.0% declined 100 basis points primarily due to food-related mix shift, partially offset by sales leverage.

Q1 China/Asia Pacific Segment Results

3

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net revenues for the China/Asia Pacific segment grew 9% over Q1 FY17 to $843.7 million in Q1 FY18, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 1,033 net new store openings over the past 12 months and a 1% increase in comparable store sales. The increase was partially offset by the absence of revenue related to the sale of our Singapore retail operations to a licensed partner in Q4 FY17 as part of the company's ongoing efforts to streamline business operations and retail geographies.

Q1 FY18 operating income of $196.8 million grew 20% over Q1 FY17 operating income of $163.4 million. Operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 23.3%, primarily due to sales leverage and favorable foreign currency translation.

Q1 EMEA Segment Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net revenues for the EMEA segment grew 8% over Q1 FY17 to $283.9 million in Q1 FY18, primarily driven by favorable foreign currency translation and incremental revenues from the opening of 365 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months.

Operating income of $39.1 million in Q1 FY18 declined 11% versus operating income of $44.1 million in Q1 FY17. Operating margin declined 300 basis points to 13.8% primarily driven by sales deleverage in company-operated stores.

Q1 Channel Development Segment Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net revenues for the Channel Development segment of $560.3 million in Q1 FY18 increased 1% versus the prior year quarter primarily driven by our foodservice, international and packaged coffee channels. This increase was partially offset by competitive pricing on single-serve items and the absence of revenue from the sale of our Tazo tea brand late in Q1 FY18.

Operating income of $243.3 million in Q1 FY18 was flat compared to Q1 FY17. Operating margin declined 50 basis points to 43.4% primarily driven by deleverage on cost of sales and lower income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, partially offset by lower marketing expense. 

Q1 All Other Segments Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

All Other Segments primarily includes Teavana-branded stores, Seattle’s Best Coffee®, and Starbucks ReserveTM and Roastery businesses. The operating loss in Q1 FY18 was primarily due to restructuring costs related to our strategy to close Teavana retail stores and focus on Teavana tea within Starbucks stores.

Fiscal 2018 Targets

The company reiterates the following full year FY18 targets, with the exception of earnings per share which has been modified for the expected net impact of changes in the U.S. tax law and related reinvestments. Year-over-year growth is based on prior year non-GAAP results. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures at the end of this release.

•Continue to expect approximately 2,300 net new stores globally

•Continue to expect 3-5% comparable store sales growth globally, expect to be near the low end of the range for the year

•Continue to expect consolidated revenue growth in the high single digits consistent with long term guidance; when including approximately 2% of net favorability related to the acquisition of East China and other streamlining activities, we expect consolidated revenue growth of approximately 9-11% in FY18

•Now expect GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32 to $3.36 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.48 to $2.53, consistent with guidance issued last quarter but updated to include the expected net impact of the new U.S. tax law's federal statutory tax rate and related reinvestments

The company will provide select quarterly and segment information regarding its business outlook during its regularly scheduled quarterly earnings conference calls; this information will also be available following the call on the company's website at http://investor.starbucks.com.

Company Updates

•On December 31, Starbucks completed the previously announced acquisition of the remaining 50% share of its East China business from long-term joint venture partners, Uni-President ("UPEC") and President Chain Store Corporation ("PCSC"). As a result of this acquisition, Starbucks has assumed 100% ownership of over 1,400 Starbucks stores in Shanghai and in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, bringing the total number of company-owned stores in China to over 3,100 at the time of closing. Also on December 31, UPEC and PCSC acquired Starbucks 50% interest in President Starbucks Coffee Taiwan Limited and assumed 100% ownership of Starbucks operations in Taiwan.

•The company completed its previously announced sale of the Tazo Tea brand to Unilever on December 11. Starbucks will instead drive a single tea brand strategy and focus with its super premium tea brand, Teavana, by continuing to invest in the growth, innovation and development of the Teavana brand of teas in its Starbucks stores and in channels outside its stores.

•In November 2017, the company opened its first store in Jamaica and entered its 76th market globally, marking a historic milestone for the global coffee company’s Caribbean operations and its storied history of sourcing high-quality coffee from the region going back more than four decades.

Non-GAAP Disclosure

In addition to the GAAP results provided in this release, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, or alternatives for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS exclude the below listed items, as they do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's future operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS are operating income, operating margin and diluted net earnings per share, respectively.

Non-GAAP ExclusionRationale

East China acquisition-related gainManagement excludes the gain on the purchase of our East China joint venture as this incremental gain is specific to the purchase activity and for reasons discussed above.

Sale of Taiwan joint venture operationsManagement excludes the gain related to the sale of our Taiwan joint venture operations as this incremental gain is specific to the sale activity and for reasons discussed above. 

Sale of Tazo brandManagement excludes the net gain on the sale of our assets associated with our Tazo brand and associated transaction costs as these items do not reflect future gains, losses, costs or tax benefits and for reasons discussed above. 

Restructuring expensesManagement excludes restructuring charges related to strategic shifts in its Teavana and e-commerce business units as well as related to divesting certain lower margin businesses and assets, such as closure of certain company-operated stores for reasons discussed above. Additionally, these expenses are anticipated to be completed within a finite period of time.

CAP transaction and integration-related costsManagement excludes transaction and integration costs and amortization of the acquired intangible assets for reasons discussed above. Additionally, the majority of these costs will be recognized over a finite period of time.

Sale of Singapore retail operationsManagement excludes the net gain related to the sale of our Singapore retail operations as these items do not reflect future gains, losses or tax impacts and for reasons discussed above. 

Sale of Germany retail operationsManagement excludes the net gain, associated costs and changes in estimated indemnifications related to the sale of our Germany retail operations as these items do not reflect future gains, losses or tax impacts and for reasons discussed above. 

The Starbucks Foundation donationManagement excludes the company's largest donation to a non-profit organization for reasons discussed above. 

2018 U.S. stock awardManagement excludes the announced incremental 2018 stock-based compensation award for reasons discussed above. 

Other tax mattersOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into U.S. law. Management excludes the estimated transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings and the re–measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate for reasons discussed above. 

Non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS may have limitations as analytical tools. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than the company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
