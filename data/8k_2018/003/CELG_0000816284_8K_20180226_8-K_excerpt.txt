 ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.   

On February 27, 2018, Celgene Corporation (the “Company”) issued a press release announcing that it received a Refusal to File letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regarding its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for ozanimod in development for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Upon its preliminary review, the FDA determined that the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the NDA were insufficient to permit a complete review. Celgene intends to seek immediate guidance, including requesting a Type A meeting with the FDA, to ascertain what additional information will be required to resubmit the NDA. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
