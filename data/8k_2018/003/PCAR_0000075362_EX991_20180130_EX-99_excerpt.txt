FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

PACCAR Achieves Record Annual Revenues and Strong Profits 

Increased Truck Market Share and Aftermarket Parts Drive Results 

January 30, 2018, Bellevue, Washington – “PACCAR reported excellent annual revenues and profitability in 2017. PACCAR achieved its 79th consecutive year of net income,” said Ron Armstrong, chief executive officer. “PACCAR’s financial results reflect the company’s premium-quality products and services, record heavy-duty truck market share in the U.S. and Canada, record aftermarket parts results and a strong European truck market. I am very proud of our 25,000 employees who have delivered outstanding products and services to our customers.” 

PACCAR’s profitability and strong cash flow have enabled the company to invest in its core markets and expand its presence in emerging markets. “PACCAR is well-positioned for long-term growth with ongoing investments in new truck models, integrated PACCAR powertrains, enhanced aerodynamic truck designs, advanced driver assistance and truck connectivity technologies, and expanded manufacturing and parts distribution facilities,” added Armstrong.  

Excellent Revenue and Net Income  

PACCAR achieved record quarterly net sales and financial service revenues of $5.45 billion in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $4.07 billion for the same period in 2016. PACCAR earned $589.2 million ($1.67 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2017, including $173.4 million of net tax benefits resulting from recent changes to U.S. tax law. The one-time net tax benefits include a reduction of net deferred tax liabilities of $304.0 million, partially offset by a tax on accumulated foreign earnings of $130.6 million. Excluding the one-time tax benefits, PACCAR reported adjusted net income (non-GAAP)1 of $415.8 million ($1.18 per diluted share). The company earned $288.8 million ($.82 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2016.  

PACCAR achieved record revenues of $19.46 billion in 2017, a 14 percent increase compared to revenues of $17.03 billion in 2016. PACCAR earned $1.68 billion ($4.75 per diluted share) in 2017, including the $173.4 million one-time tax benefit. Excluding the one-time tax benefit, PACCAR earned adjusted net income (non-GAAP)1 of $1.50 billion ($4.26 per diluted share). The company reported annual net income of $521.7 million ($1.48 per diluted share) in 2016, including an $833.0 million non-recurring charge for a European Commission (EC) settlement. Excluding the charge, PACCAR reported adjusted net income (non-GAAP)1 of $1.35 billion ($3.85 per diluted share) in 2016.  

United States Tax Reform Benefit 

“The enacted tax legislation will generate positive cash flow for PACCAR as well as benefit the transportation industry in the United States,” said Harrie Schippers, president and chief financial officer. “The revised corporate tax rate, comparable to other leading OECD countries’ tax rates, and accelerated machinery and equipment depreciation, will likely stimulate increased capital investment in the United States.” PACCAR estimates that its 2018 effective global tax rate will be 23 to 25 percent, compared to approximately 31 percent prior to the new tax law.  

Increased Dividends 

PACCAR declared cash dividends of $2.19 per share during 2017, including a special dividend of $1.20 per share paid in January 2018. This compares to cash dividends of $1.56 per share declared in 2016. PACCAR’s dividend yield was an excellent 3.1 percent as of December 31, 2017. The company has paid a dividend every year since 1941.

U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck industry retail sales are expected to increase to a range of 235,000-265,000 trucks in 2018,” said Gary Moore, PACCAR executive vice president. “Kenworth and Peterbilt achieved record Class 8 retail market share of 30.7 percent in the U.S. and Canada in 2017, compared to 28.5 percent in 2016.

The new DAF XF and CF trucks earned the “International Truck of the Year 2018” award, as judged by an independent jury of leading transportation journalists from 23 European countries.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

This earnings release includes “adjusted net income (non-GAAP)” and “adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP)”, which are financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), since they exclude the one-time tax benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("new U.S. tax law") in 2017 and the non-recurring European Commission charge in 2016. These measures differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 

Management utilizes these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s performance and believes these measures allow investors and management to evaluate operating trends by excluding significant non-recurring items that are not representative of underlying operating trends.  

Reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP measures of: adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) are as follows:
