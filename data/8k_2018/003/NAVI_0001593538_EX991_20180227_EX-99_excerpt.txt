 Forward-Looking Statements; Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following information is current as of December 31, 2017 (unless otherwise noted) and should be read in connection with Navient Corporation’s (Navient) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the “2017 Form 10-K”), filed by Navient with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 26, 2018 and subsequent reports filed by Navient with the SEC. Definitions for capitalized terms in this presentation not defined herein can be found in our 2017 Form 10-K. This presentation contains “forward-looking” statements and other information that is based on management’s current expectations as of the date of this presentation. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the company’s beliefs, opinions or expectations and statements that assume or are dependent upon future events, are forward-looking statements and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “would,” or “target.” Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from those reflected in such forward-looking statements. For Navient, these factors include, among others, the risks and uncertainties associated with : • increases in financing costs or the availability of financing; • limits on our liquidity resulting from disruptions in the capital markets or other factors; • unanticipated increases in costs associated with compliance with federal, state or local laws and regulations; • changes in the demand for asset management and business processing solutions or other changes in the marketplaces including increased competition in which we compete; • changes in accounting standards including but not limited to changes pertaining to loan loss reserves and estimates or other accounting standards that may impact our operations; • adverse outcomes in any significant litigation to which the company is a party; • credit risk associated with the company’s underwriting standards or exposure to third parties, including counterparties to the company’s hedging transactions; and • changes in the terms of education loans and the educational credit marketplace generally (including changes resulting from new laws and the implementation of existing laws). The company could also be affected by, among other things: • unanticipated repayment trends on loans including prepayments or deferrals on loans in our FFELP securitization trusts that could accelerate or delay repayment of the bonds beyond their legal final maturity date; • reductions in our credit ratings, the credit ratings of asset-backed securitizations we sponsor or the credit ratings of the United States of America; • failures of our operating systems or infrastructure or those of third-party vendors; • risks related to cybersecurity including the potential disruption of our systems or of our customers or our third-party vendors or customers or potential disclosure of confidential customer information; • damage to our reputation resulting from cyber-breaches, litigation, the politicization of student loan servicing or other actions or factors; • failure to successfully implement cost-cutting initiatives and adverse effects of such initiatives on our business; • failure to adequately integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions including delays or errors in converting portfolio acquisitions to our servicing platform; • changes in law and regulations whether new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to any of our businesses or activities or those of vendors, suppliers, or customers; • changes in the general interest rate environment, including the availability of any relevant money market index rate, including LIBOR, or the relationship between the relevant money-market index rate and the rate at which our assets are priced; • our ability to successfully effectuate any acquisitions and other strategic initiatives; • changes in general economic conditions; and • the other factors that are described in the “Risk Factors” section of Navient’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and in its future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements also requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions including estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates or assumptions may prove to be incorrect and actual results could differ materially. All forward-looking statements contained in this release are qualified by these cautionary statements and are made only as of the date of this release. The company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements except as required by law. Navient reports financial results on a GAAP basis and also provides certain non-GAAP “core earnings“ performance measures. When compared to GAAP results, “core earnings” exclude the impact of: (1) unrealized, mark-to-market gains/losses on derivatives; and (2) goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization and impairment. Navient provides core earnings measures because this is what management uses when making management decisions regarding Navient’s performance and the allocation of corporate resources. Navient core earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional information, see “Core Earnings — Definition and Limitations” in Navient’s fourth quarter earnings release for a further discussion and a complete reconciliation between GAAP net income and core earnings.

 Navient's default prevention expertise was a key factor in the decline of the national default rate 2014 three-year cohort default rate The cohort default rate (CDR) measures the percent of borrowers who defaulted on a student loan within three years of entering repayment. In 2017, the Department of Education announced the 2014 CDR was 11.5 percent, a small increase from 2016 (11.3 percent) and a significant decrease since 2013 (14.7 percent). The CDR for Navient-serviced customers was 7.8 percent, 37 percent lower than the national rate excluding Navient-serviced borrowers. Our outreach to borrowers is key. Nine times out of 10, if we can reach a struggling borrower, we can help him or her avoid default. Source: "Official Cohort Default Rates for Schools,” Federal Student Aid, 9/27/17; Navient data The 2014 Cohort Default Rate analyzes data from the group of borrowers who entered repayment between Oct. 1, 2013, and Sept. 30, 2014, and who defaulted in a three-year window by fall of 2016. To isolate the difference in defaults between Navient borrowers and others, the difference is calculated by removing Navient’s market share from the overall national cohort default rate; the resulting CDR for non-Navient serviced borrowers is 12.4 percent. 7.8% Navient's CDR is 37 percent lower than all others 11.5% All borrowers (%)

 The cohort default triangles featured on subsequent slides are segmented by loan program type, FICO score, cosigner status, and school type Terms and calculations used in the cohort default triangles are defined below: Repayment Year – The calendar year loans entered repayment Disbursed Principal Entering Repayment – The amount of principal entering repayment in a given year, based on disbursed principal prior to any interest capitalization Years in Repayment – Measured in years between repayment start date and default date. Zero represents defaults that occurred prior to the start of repayment. Periodic Defaults – Defaulted principal in each Year in Repayment as a percentage of the disbursed principal entering repayment in each Repayment Year Defaulted principal includes any interest capitalization that occurred prior to default Defaulted principal is not reduced by any amounts recovered after the loan defaulted Because the numerator includes capitalized interest while the denominator does not, default rates are higher than if the numerator and denominator both included capitalized interest Total – The sum of Periodic Defaults across Years in Repayment for each Repayment Year Cohort Default Triangles
