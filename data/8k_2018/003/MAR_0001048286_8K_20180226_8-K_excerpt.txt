The following summary of the Agreements is qualified in its entirety by the terms and provisions of the Agreements, which are attached as Exhibits to this filing. 

Under the License, Services and Development Agreements for Marriott Projects and for Ritz-Carlton Projects, the Company licenses certain of its Marriott and Ritz-Carlton trademarks and other intellectual property to MVWC for use in the timeshare and fractional business of MVWC. Under those agreements, MVWC also generally has the exclusive rights to use, for timeshare purposes, customer facing elements of the reservations system that the Company uses for its Marriott Hotels and Resorts branded and Ritz-Carlton branded hotels, as well as the loyalty programs used for Marriott Hotels and Resorts branded and Ritz-Carlton branded hotels (currently, the Marriott Rewards and Ritz-Carlton Rewards programs) and the right to market to the members thereof (such systems and programs collectively, the “Marriott Channels”), in connection with MVWC’s timeshare business conducted under such License, Services and Development Agreements. The License, Services and Development Agreements are described in more detail in the Information Statement that MVWC filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 25, 2011 as Exhibit 99.1 to MVWC’s Registration Statement on Form 10 (File No. 001-35219) (the “MVWC Form 10”), in the section entitled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions -License Agreements for Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Marks and Intellectual Property,” which is hereby incorporated by reference. 

Under a separate License, Services and Development Agreement between Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC (formerly known as Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. and now a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company)(“Starwood”), Vistana Signature Experiences, Inc. (“Vistana”) and ILG, Inc., Starwood licenses certain of its Sheraton and Westin trademarks and other intellectual property to Vistana for use in the timeshare business of Vistana (the “Licensed Vistana Business”). Under that agreement, Vistana generally has nonexclusive rights to use customer facing elements of the reservations system that Starwood uses for its hotels, as well as the Starwood Preferred Guest loyalty program and the right to market to the members thereof (together, the “Starwood Channels”), in connection with the Licensed Vistana Business. 

The License Agreement Amendments amend certain provisions of the License, Services and Development Agreements for Marriott Projects and for Ritz-Carlton Projects to permit the participation by Vistana, as part of the Licensed Vistana Business, in the Marriott Channels upon the harmonization and integration of the Marriott Channels and the Starwood Channels into single integrated platforms (the “Platform Combinations”). 

The License Agreement Amendments also provide for an annual $3 million reduction in the base royalty payment made by MVWC to the Company, which amount is currently $51,875,650 per year (and is adjusted by an inflation factor every 5 years), commencing in 2018 on a pro-rated basis and continuing for as long as Vistana is able to access the Marriott Channels. The License Agreement Amendments also expand MVWC’s rights to market its vacation ownership products at hotels operating under certain of the Company’s marks and as an option under MVWC’s exchange program.

MVWC issues Marriott Rewards points for certain approved purposes in connection with MVWC’s business and participates in the Marriott Rewards loyalty program under the Marriott Rewards Affiliation Agreement, as described in the MVWC Form 10 in the section entitled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions -Marriott Rewards Affiliation Agreement,” which is hereby incorporated by reference. The Rewards Agreement Amendment amends certain provisions of the Marriott Rewards Affiliation Agreement in connection with the planned Platform Combinations.
