On January 16, 2018, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the board of directors of Apache Corporation (the “Company”) approved both a new form of Performance Share Grant Agreement (the “Performance Share Grant Agreement”) and a new form of Stock Option Grant Agreement (the “Option Grant Agreement”, and, together with the Performance Share Grant Agreement, the “Grant Agreements”). Pursuant to the Grant Agreements, the Company will award performance shares in the Company (“Performance Shares”) and stock options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock (“Stock Options”), respectively, to the Company’s executive officers under the Company’s 2016 Omnibus Compensation Plan. The continued vesting conditions of the Company’s previous forms of Grant Agreements have been replaced with a matrix that specifies the continued vesting of the recipient’s Performance Shares or Stock Options, as applicable, based on the recipient’s age at retirement and years of service with the Company. The foregoing descriptions of the Grant Agreements do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by, the full text of the Performance Share Grant Agreement and the Option Grant Agreement that are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
