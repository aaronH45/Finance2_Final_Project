___________________________________________________________________________________________

MELBOURNE, Fla., Jan. 30, 2018 — Harris Corporation (NYSE:HRS) reported fiscal 2018 second quarter revenue of $1.54 billion, up 6% compared with the prior year. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $1.15 (GAAP) and $1.67 (non-GAAP1), compared with $1.30 (GAAP) and $1.38 (non-GAAP1) in the prior year. Operating cash flow was $278 million and free cash flow was $258 million compared with operating cash flow of $252 million and free cash flow of $224 million in the prior year. 

"We generated solid results in the second quarter driven by the strongest revenue growth we have achieved in more than seven years, including a 26% increase in tactical radio sales," said William M. Brown, chairman, president and chief executive officer. “In the first half, revenue and orders were up in all segments, and company book-to-bill was a robust 1.3. As a result of our strong performance and improved revenue outlook despite a lengthened continuing resolution, as well as benefits from tax reform, we have increased EPS guidance for the fiscal year."

______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

1Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 second quarter excludes non-cash charges from a one-time write-down of deferred tax assets and from an adjustment for deferred compensation and for fiscal 2017 second quarter excludes Exelis acquisition-related charges. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in the attached tables.

Summary Financial Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Second quarter revenue increased 6%, with growth in Communication Systems and Electronic Systems partially offset by a slight decline in Space and Intelligence Systems. The decrease in GAAP EPS was primarily due to non-cash charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from a $52 million one-time write-down of deferred tax assets and from an adjustment for deferred compensation, partially offset by the absence of Exelis acquisition-related charges incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP EPS increased by $.29, which includes $.21 of benefit from tax reform and $.08 from higher volume, operational excellence, higher pension income and a lower share count, partially offset by the absence of a $22 million favorable contract adjustment incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin remained strong at 18.5%. Orders increased 13% to $1.4 billion. 

First half revenue increased 3%, with growth across all three segments. GAAP EPS was up 3% due to the absence of Exelis acquisition-related charges incurred in the first half of fiscal 2017, partially offset by the non-cash charges incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Non-GAAP EPS was up 15% on increased volume, benefit from tax reform, higher pension income, strong program execution and year-over-year integration synergy savings, partially offset by a $36 million unfavorable impact from the ADS-B program. Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 18.9%. Orders grew 24%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.3.

Communication Systems

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The 18% increase in second quarter segment revenue was primarily due to a 56% increase in DoD Tactical revenue driven by readiness demand across all the Services and a 9% increase in International Tactical revenue from strong growth in the Middle East. Operating income grew 19% on increased volume and operational efficiencies.

DoD Tactical momentum continued in the second quarter, with both ground tactical and airborne awards:

•$765 million ceiling, 5-year, single-award IDIQ contract with the U.S. Navy to provide tactical radios and ancillary devices

•$71 million contract modification from the U.S. Army for single-channel ground and airborne radio systems (SINCGARS)

•$60 million order from the U.S. Air Force for Falcon III® tactical radios

•$42 million order from the U.S. Army for the Security Force Assistance Brigade for Falcon III® tactical radios and waveforms

International Tactical received several key orders for modernization programs and ongoing counter-terrorism support:

•$45 million from Iraq for security forces modernization

•$18 million from Afghanistan to provide sustainment services to its security forces 

•$10 million from the Royal Danish Army for tactical vehicular radio systems 

Electronic Systems

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The 2% increase in second quarter segment revenue reflected higher volume in Avionics, with growth on the F-35 and several other platforms, and in C4ISR from the ramp of the UAE battle management system and U.K. robotics programs, partially offset by contract adjustments in Mission Networks, including the absence of the favorable prior-year adjustment on the ADS-B program. Operating income declined 25% as strong performance on Electronic Warfare (EW) programs and the benefit of higher volume in Avionics were more than offset by the contract adjustments in Mission Networks, higher R&D expenses and unfavorable mix.

New awards continued to strengthen the company's strategic position in Avionics on both domestic and international large platforms. Domestic awards included a $93 million contract for F-35 LRIP 11 release systems and a $48 million, 5-year block buy contract for LRIP 12-14 in support of the F-35 antenna production program. International awards included a $25 million contract for release systems to support Qatar F-15s and a development contract for release systems on the Korean Next Generation Indigenous Fighter with significant follow-on potential.

Space and Intelligence Systems

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Second quarter segment revenue declined slightly as higher revenue from Classified programs was more than offset by lower revenue from environmental programs. Operating income increased 7% to $81 million on productivity and incremental pension income. 

Order momentum continued in Classified programs as further progress on investments in innovative ground processing capabilities and small satellite technology resulted in additional funding for an award announced in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and in a multi-million dollar, multi-year award in ground processing for next generation operational software. The segment also received additional funding from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency for an IDIQ contract received in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 to perform search and retrieval services for geospatial products.

Additionally, funding support continued for key environmental programs, including a $25 million award for GOES-R program sustainment and two new awards totaling up to $95 million to monitor weather satellite transmission interference for the U.S. Department of Commerce and to provide satellite ground capabilities for the U.S. Air Force weather satellite recapitalization effort.

Cash and Capital Deployment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the first half of fiscal 2018, Harris generated free cash flow of $330 million and returned $287 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the period with $422 million of cash.

Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in the attached tables.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including operating income, operating margin and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2018 and expected earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for fiscal 2018, in each case excluding non-cash charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 from a one-time write-down of deferred tax assets and from an adjustment for deferred compensation; operating income, operating margin and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2017, in each case excluding acquisition-related charges; and free cash flow for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2018 and the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2017 and expected free cash flow for fiscal 2018, in each case excluding cash flow for net capital expenditures. A “non-GAAP financial measure” is generally defined as a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future performance that excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments, so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Harris management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. Harris management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze Harris business trends and to understand Harris performance. In addition, Harris may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND REGULATION G DISCLOSURE

To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we provide additional measures of income from continuing operations per diluted common share, operating income, operating margin and net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted to exclude certain costs, charges, expenses and losses or other amounts. Harris management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. Harris management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze Harris’ business trends and to understand Harris’ performance. In addition, Harris may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as guides in its forecasting, budgeting, and long-term planning processes and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes. Any analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP follows:
