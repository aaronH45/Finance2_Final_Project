Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. 

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, specifically reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. 

As a result of the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21%, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require companies to re-value their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment, with the resulting tax effects accounted for in the reporting period of enactment. Based on currently available information, the Company estimates the value of its net deferred tax assets will be reduced by approximately $55 million, which will be recorded in its 2017 fourth quarter earnings. In addition, as a result of the Tax Act, the Company estimates its future effective tax rate will be in the mid-twenties beginning in the first quarter of 2018. However, the Company’s actual net deferred tax asset reduction, as well as the Company’s effective tax rate beginning in 2018, may vary materially from these estimates due to a number of uncertainties and factors, including the completion of Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ending December 31, 2017, as well as due to further analysis and clarification of the Tax Act that cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 

Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain statements made in this Current Report on Form 8-K may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws, as amended, regarding the expectations of management with respect to the impact on the Company of the Tax Act, including the expected revaluation of the net deferred tax assets in the Company’s quarter ending December 31, 2017, and the anticipated effective tax rate for 2018. The Company cautions that these statements are based on management’s current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of the control of the Company, that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from the statements made herein. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk that Company’s preliminary analysis of the impact of the Tax Act may be incorrect, additional changes in tax laws, and the factors discussed in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
