Significant NiSource achievements in 2017 included:

•A record level of safety performance for employees - achieving industry top decile in core safety metrics, and a continued decline in preventable vehicle accidents.

•Improved customer service scores across all NiSource utilities, including Columbia Gas of Virginia, which was recognized as one of the nation's top gas only brands, and NIPSCO, as one of the most improved electric brands.

•A record $1.7 billion invested in its gas and electric utilities. This includes replacing 377 miles of priority natural gas pipeline, further enhancing safety and driving reductions in leaks and methane emissions, as well as 68 miles of underground electric cable, and about 1,300 electric poles, to support increased service reliability.

•Constructive progress on significant regulatory initiatives supporting our business plan, including approvals of gas base rate case settlements in Maryland and Virginia; gas modernization tracker update filings in six states; and the approval of an environmental investment settlement in Indiana.

•Refinancing nearly $1 billion in long-term debt at more favorable rates, which is expected to result in significant interest expense savings over the next several years.

•Adding nearly 28,000 net new customers, driven by increased conversions to natural gas from other fuels and a healthy housing market.

•Establishing aggressive environmental targets supported by NiSource's business strategy, including a 50 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2025.

2018 Guidance, Growth, Capital Forecasts Reaffirmed Following Federal Tax Reform

As noted in its December 21, 2017 news release, NiSource believes the comprehensive federal tax reform signed into law will lower costs for customers and supports continued investment in critical utility infrastructure that benefits our customers and communities.

Based upon the expected regulatory implementation of the law's provisions, NiSource continues to expect to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings of $1.26 to $1.32 per share in 2018, and make capital investments of $1.7 to $1.8 billion.

The company also expects to grow its net operating earnings per share (non-GAAP) and dividend by 5 to 7 percent each year through 2020. On January 26, 2018 the company increased its dividend to an annualized 78 cents per share, up from 70 cents per share in 2017. NiSource continues to expect to invest $1.6 to $1.8 billion annually in its utility infrastructure programs through 2020, and remains committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2017, NiSource had approximately $1 billion in net available liquidity, consisting of cash and available capacity under its credit facility and accounts receivable securitizations.

NiSource reminds investors that it does not provide a GAAP equivalent of its earnings guidance due to the impact of unpredictable factors such as fluctuations in weather, asset sales and impairments, and other items included in GAAP results.

"We're confident in our ability to meet our commitments to our customers and the financial community while also managing through changes which will result from tax reform," Hamrock said.

This press release includes financial results and guidance for NiSource with respect to net operating earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC’s Regulation G.
