People’s United Financial Reports Fourth Quarter Net Income of $106.2 Million, or $0.30 Per Common Share; Operating Earnings of $0.31 Per Common Share  

BRIDGEPORT, CT – People’s United Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBCT) today reported net income of $106.2 million, or $0.30 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $75.9 million, or $0.24 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $90.8 million, or $0.26 per common share, for the third quarter of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income totaled $337.2 million, or $0.97 per common share, compared to $281.0 million, or $0.92 per common share, for 2016.  

Included in both the fourth quarter and full year 2017 results were the following items, which are deemed non-operating, given their non-recurring nature: merger-related expenses; security losses incurred as a tax planning strategy in response to tax reform; and a tax benefit realized in connection with tax reform. The comparable periods in the prior year included merger-related expenses and acquisition integration costs.  

Operating earnings were $104.5 million, or $0.31 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $75.1 million, or $0.24 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $89.3 million, or $0.26 per common share, for the third quarter of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, operating earnings totaled $345.8 million, or $1.04 per common share, compared to $282.3 million, or $0.93 per common share, for 2016.  

The Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.1725 per common share quarterly dividend payable February 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on February 1, 2018. Based on the closing stock price on January 17, 2018, the dividend yield on People’s United Financial common stock is 3.5 percent.  

“The Company’s performance in 2017 demonstrated our commitment to enhancing profitability and building the business for the long-term,” commented Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Full year operating earnings of $345.8 million is the highest in the bank’s 175 year history, while operating earnings per common share of $1.04 increased for the eighth consecutive year. Period-end loan and deposit balances were $32.6 billion and $33.1 billion, respectively, up 10 percent and 11 percent from a year ago. These results reflect the hard work of our employees who successfully closed and integrated two acquisitions during the year and delivered continued organic growth across the franchise.”

Barnes concluded, “We are excited by the opportunities in front of us to further strengthen and grow the Company. In the year ahead, we will continue to enhance technology and marketing capabilities to better serve existing relationships and develop new ones. We will also provide new and refreshed products as well as align technology-based offerings with our expert bankers to drive a unique client experience. We are confident revenue producing investments along with synergies created by recent acquisitions will result in continued improvement in operating leverage and further create value for shareholders in 2018 and beyond.”  

“We closed out 2017 with another quarter of strong financial performance,” stated David Rosato, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “Record quarterly operating earnings of $104.5 million increased 17 percent on a linked-quarter basis and generated an operating return on average tangible common equity of 14.1 percent. These results benefited from further improvement in net interest margin, higher fee income and well-controlled expenses. The quarter was also favorably impacted by a lower effective tax rate primarily due to continued investment in tax preferenced items as well as a tax benefit realized as a result of recently enacted tax reform.”  

Rosato concluded, “Linked-quarter loan growth continued to highlight the importance of our diversified business mix. Period-end loan growth was driven by strong results across each of our equipment financing units and solid production in middle market commercial and industrial lending. These increases were partially offset by lower commercial real estate balances primarily due to market conditions and continued runoff of the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio. Period-end deposits were up from the end of the third quarter reflecting higher demand deposits as well as a successful CD offering celebrating the Company’s 175th anniversary. On an average balance basis, loans and deposits increased four percent and ten percent annualized, respectively.”  

Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average total loans on an annualized basis were 0.08 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase from 0.06 percent in both the third quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2016. For the originated loan portfolio, non-performing loans equaled 0.49 percent of loans at December 31, 2017, an improvement from both 0.59 percent at September 30, 2017 and 0.51 percent at December 31, 2016.  

Return on average assets of 0.96 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 was an increase from both 0.84 percent in the third quarter of 2017 and 0.75 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. Return on average tangible common equity of 13.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 was an increase from both 11.8 percent in the third quarter of 2017 and 10.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.  

At December 31, 2017, People’s United Financial’s common equity tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital ratios were 9.7 percent and 12.2 percent, respectively, and the tangible common equity ratio stood at 7.2 percent. For People’s United Bank, N.A., the common equity tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital ratios were 10.7 percent and 12.6 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2017.  

People’s United Financial, Inc., a diversified financial services company with $44 billion in total assets, provides commercial and retail banking, as well as wealth management services through a network of approximately 400 branches in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP  

In addition to evaluating People’s United Financial Inc. (“People’s United”) results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible common equity ratios, tangible book value per common share and operating earnings metrics. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People’s United’s underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. Further, the efficiency ratio and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control, while the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are used to analyze the relative strength of People’s United’s capital position.  

The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People’s United to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding operating lease expense, goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangible assets, losses on real estate assets and non-recurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis plus total non-interest income (including the FTE adjustment on bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) income, the netting of operating lease expense and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans and acquired loans, and non-recurring income) (the denominator). People’s United generally considers an item of income or expense to be non-recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.  

Operating earnings exclude from net income available to common shareholders those items that management considers to be of such a non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), People’s United’s results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to: (i) non-recurring gains/losses; (ii) merger-related expenses, including acquisition integration and other costs; (iii) writedowns of banking house assets and related lease termination costs; (iv) severance-related costs; and (v) charges related to executive-level management separation costs, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Effective in 2016, recurring writedowns of banking house assets and certain severance-related costs are no longer considered to be non-operating expenses. Operating earnings per common share (“EPS”) is derived by determining the per common share impact of the respective adjustments to arrive at operating earnings and adding (subtracting) such amounts to (from) EPS, as reported. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average total assets. Operating return on average tangible common equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average tangible common equity. The operating common dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing common dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.  

The tangible common equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible common equity (total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock, goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the denominator). Tangible book value per common share is calculated by dividing tangible common equity by common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) common shares).  

In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by People’s United for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions.
