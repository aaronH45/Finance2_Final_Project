 Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.  

On February 26, 2018, the Company filed an amendment (the “Amendment”) to its Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles”) with the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions to change each share of common stock, $.01 par value, of the Company (the “Common Stock”) outstanding or held in treasury into two shares of Common Stock to effect a two-for-one split of the Common Stock. The Amendment increased the Company’s authorized shares of Common Stock from 900,000,000 to 1,800,000,000, effective at the close of business on March 5, 2018 (the “Record Date”).  

In connection with the two-for-one stock split, at the Record Date, each share of Common Stock outstanding or held in treasury immediately prior to the Record Date will be changed into two shares of Common Stock. Stock certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock outstanding or held in treasury on the Record Date will continue to evidence the same number of shares that such certificates evidenced prior to the Record Date, and the additional shares will be evidenced in book-entry form only, without stock certificates, on March 19, 2018 to persons who were at the Record Date the holders of Common Stock.  

The Amendment and the Company’s Restated Articles of Incorporation, reflecting the Amendment, are filed as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by reference herein.
