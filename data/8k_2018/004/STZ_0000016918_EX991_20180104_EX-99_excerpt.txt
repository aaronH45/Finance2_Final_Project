“It’s been a dynamic time for our business. In 2017, Constellation was one of the best performers among S&P 500 Consumer Staples stocks driven by the overall strength of our results and the ongoing growth prospects for our business. We recently established a first mover advantage in an emerging consumer category with our investment in Canopy Growth. We continue to make smart investments with the planned addition of a fifth furnace at our glass production plant in Nava. And, we are pleased with the outcome of tax reform legislation that allows U.S. companies to remain competitive globally and we believe it will be positive for Constellation going forward.”

Reported basis (“reported”) are amounts as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Comparable basis (“comparable”) are amounts which exclude items that affect comparability (“comparable adjustments”), as they are not reflective of core operations of the segments. The company’s measure of segment profitability excludes comparable adjustments, which is consistent with the measure used by management to evaluate results. The company discusses various non-GAAP measures in this news release. Financial statements, as well as supplemental schedules and tables reconciling non-GAAP measures, together with definitions of these measures and the reasons management uses these measures, are included in this news release.

Free Cash Flow Guidance

Free cash flow, as defined in the reconciliation below, is considered a liquidity measure and is considered to provide useful information to investors about the amount of cash generated, which can then be used, after required debt service and dividend payments, for other general corporate purposes. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, cash flow from operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.
