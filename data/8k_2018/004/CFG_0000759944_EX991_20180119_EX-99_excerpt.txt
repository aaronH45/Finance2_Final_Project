Discussion of Results:  

Fourth quarter 2017 results include a net $317 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, after-tax benefit from notable items, including a $331 million after-tax benefit for the adjustment of the company’s net deferred tax liability tied to the December 2017 Tax Legislation, partially offset by other notable items which reflect a $22.5 million investment in our colleagues and the communities we serve. Results also reflect a $17 million gain on the sale of a Troubled Debt Restructuring Portfolio (“TDR Transaction II”) that was offset by $18 million of other notable items largely associated with our efficiency and strategic growth initiatives. Fourth quarter 2017 EPS reflects an 8.4 million reduction in fully diluted average common shares outstanding from third quarter 2017 and a 20.1 million reduction from fourth quarter 2016.  

Full year 2017 net income available to common stockholders includes a $340 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, after-tax benefit related to notable items compared with an after-tax benefit of $19 million in 2016. For 2017 results, second quarter 2017 impairments on aircraft lease assets of $26 million have been reclassified from income and expense line items to credit-related costs. Adding these costs to provision expense resulted in total 2017 underlying credit-related costs of $347 million. These lease impairments, which largely related to a non-core runoff portfolio, reduced noninterest income by $11 million and increased noninterest expense by $15 million.  

All references to Adjusted/Underlying results* exclude the notable items as outlined in the table below.

Underlying fourth quarter 2017 net income available to common stockholders* of $349 million increased $8 million, or 2%, with Underlying diluted EPS* of $0.71 up $0.03, or 4%, from third quarter 2017, reflecting continued revenue growth and expense discipline, which drove 1.6% positive operating leverage, a 1% improvement in the efficiency ratio and ROTCE* improvement to 10.4%.  

Compared with fourth quarter 2016, fourth quarter 2017 Underlying net income to common stockholders* increased $67 million, or 24%, with diluted EPS up $0.16, or 29%, reflecting 8% revenue growth led by a 10% increase in net interest income and a 3% increase in noninterest income, which coupled with prudent expense management drove 6.4% operating leverage, a 3.7% improvement in the efficiency ratio and 2.0% improvement in ROTCE.*  

Full year 2017 net income available to common stockholders of $1.6 billion increased $607 million, or 59%, from 2016, reflecting 9% revenue growth, partially offset by 4% growth in noninterest expense. Full year 2017 diluted EPS of $3.25 increased $1.28, or 65%, and reflects a 20.2 million reduction in average fully diluted shares outstanding.  

On an Adjusted/Underlying basis,* full year 2017 net income available to common stockholders of $1.3 billion increased $286 million, or 28%, compared with full year 2016, as 11% growth in net interest income and 7% growth in noninterest income drove a 10% increase in revenue. Our disciplined expense management allowed us to generate operating leverage of 6.8% and led to a 4% reduction in the efficiency ratio. On an Adjusted/Underlying basis, full year 2017 diluted EPS of $2.58 increased $0.65, or 34%, while ROTCE improved by 2.2% to 9.8%.*  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net interest income of $1.1 billion increased $18 million, or 2%, from third quarter 2017, reflecting loan growth and a three basis point improvement in net interest margin to 3.08% from third quarter levels that included a two basis point benefit from higher commercial loan interest recoveries. The improvement in net interest margin reflects higher interest-earning asset yields tied to higher short-term interest rates and improving loan mix toward higher-return categories, partially offset by higher deposit and funding costs.  

Compared to fourth quarter 2016, net interest income increased $94 million, or 10%, reflecting 4% growth in average loans and an 18 basis point improvement in net interest margin. The improvement in net interest margin reflects higher interest-earning

 1) Other income includes bank-owned life insurance and other income.  

Noninterest income of $404 million increased $23 million from third quarter 2017, which includes a $17 million benefit from notable items. Underlying noninterest income* of $387 million increased $6 million from third quarter as growth in foreign exchange and interest rate products, trust and investment services fees and other income was partially offset by lower capital markets and seasonally lower card fees. Capital Markets fees decreased $11 million from record third quarter levels, as a decrease in loan syndication and bond underwriting fees was partially offset by an increase in advisory fees. Trust and investment services fees increased $4 million, reflecting an increase in sales volume and productivity, and growth in managed money assets. Foreign exchange and interest rate products increased $8 million, reflecting an increase in demand for variable rate loan hedges relative to third quarter levels that were impacted by the timing of interest-rate moves and seasonality. Other income increased $5 million, reflecting an increase in hedging income and in leasing income, despite the impact of a $3 million impairment write-down on aircraft lease assets. Securities gains were modest and relatively stable with third quarter levels and partially offset the aircraft lease impairment recorded in other income.  

Compared to fourth quarter 2016, noninterest income increased $27 million, which includes a $17 million benefit tied to notable items. On an Underlying basis,* noninterest income increased $10 million, or 3%, largely reflecting strength in trust and investment services fees, card fees, capital markets fees and letter of credit and loan fees, partially offset by lower mortgage banking fees. Card fees increased $6 million, reflecting the benefit of revised contract terms for processing fees and an increase in purchase volume. Capital markets fees increased $5 million, driven by the investments made to broaden our capabilities. Trust and investment services fees increased $8 million, reflecting improved sales volume and productivity, an increase in managed money assets and an increase in the number of financial consultants. Letter of credit and loan fees increased $2 million. Mortgage banking fees decreased $8 million from fourth quarter 2016 levels that included improved mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) valuations and higher origination volumes.

Noninterest expense of $898 million increased $40 million from third quarter 2017, reflecting $40 million of notable items. Underlying noninterest expense* remained stable compared to third quarter as increases in outside services, occupancy and equipment expense were offset by decreases in salaries and benefits and other expense. Salaries and benefits expense decreased $4 million, reflecting lower incentives and seasonally lower payroll taxes. Outside services expense increased $7 million, driven by consumer strategic growth initiatives and technology initiatives. Occupancy expense increased $2 million, reflecting seasonality, and equipment expense increased $2 million driven by higher service contract costs. Other operating expense decreased $8 million, driven by lower legal and regulatory costs and lower advertising expense.  

Compared with fourth quarter 2016, noninterest expense increased $51 million, driven by a $40 million increase related to notable items. Underlying noninterest expense* increased $11 million from fourth quarter 2016 levels as improvement in other operating expense was more than offset by increases in salaries and benefits, outside services and occupancy expense. Salaries and benefits increased $12 million driven by merit increases and the impact of hiring associated with strategic growth initiatives. Outside services increased $8 million tied to consumer strategic growth initiatives and technology initiatives. Occupancy expense increased $3 million reflecting costs associated with our branch strategy and maintenance. Other operating expense decreased $12 million driven by a reduction in fraud, legal and regulatory costs.  

The effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2017 was (32.4)%, which includes a $331 million after-tax benefit for the adjustment of the company’s net deferred tax liability tied to the December 2017 Tax Legislation. Excluding this one-time benefit, the effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2017 was 33.7%, up from the third quarter 2017 effective tax rate of 32.2%, given the impact from our historic tax-credit investment program. The fourth quarter 2016 effective tax rate was 31.9%.

Total assets of $152.3 billion at December 31, 2017 increased $980 million, or 1%, compared with September 30, 2017. Compared with December 31, 2016, total assets increased $2.8 billion, or 2%, driven by a $3.0 billion increase in loans and leases and loans held for sale.  

Average interest-earning assets of $138.4 billion in fourth quarter 2017 were up $950 million compared with third quarter 2017 driven by an increase in loans and leases. Compared with fourth quarter 2016, average interest-earning assets increased $3.7 billion, or 3%, given growth in loans and leases, partially offset by a decrease in investments and interest bearing deposits.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Period-end investments and interest-bearing deposits of $28.0 billion as of December 31, 2017 increased $602 million, or 2%, from September 30, 2017. Compared with December 31, 2016, investments and interest-bearing deposits decreased $828 million, or 3%, largely reflecting a $951 million decrease in interest bearing deposits. At the end of fourth quarter 2017, the average effective duration of the securities portfolio increased to 3.9 years compared with 3.8 years at September 30, 2017, given higher long-term rates that drove a decrease in securities prepayment speeds. At December 31, 2016, the securities

 portfolio duration was 4.3 years, reflecting the impact of somewhat higher long-term rates and a steeper yield curve, which resulted in a decrease in prepayment speeds.  

Period-end loans and leases of $110.6 billion at December 31, 2017 were relatively stable compared to September 30, 2017. Compared to December 31, 2016, period-end loans and leases increased $2.9 billion, or 3%, from $107.7 billion, reflecting a $2.6 billion increase in retail loans and a $380 million increase in commercial loans and leases.  

Average loans and leases were up $966 million compared with third quarter 2017 as retail loans increased $807 million and commercial loans and leases increased $159 million. Retail loan growth reflects strength in mortgage, education and other unsecured retail loans, partially offset by lower home equity and auto balances. Commercial loan results largely reflect growth in Mid-corporate and Private Equity, as well as the impact of our geographic expansion strategies, partially offset by a planned reduction in Asset Finance and non-core.  

Compared with fourth quarter 2016, average loans and leases increased $3.9 billion, or 4%, reflecting a $2.6 billion increase in retail loans and a $1.3 billion increase in commercial loans and leases. Retail loan growth was driven by education, mortgage and other unsecured retail, partially offset by lower home equity and auto balances. Commercial loan and lease growth was driven by strength in Mid-corporate and Private Equity, Commercial Real Estate and Franchise Finance, as well as the impact of our geographic expansion strategies, partially offset by a planned reduction in Asset Finance, lower line of credit utilization and lower non-core balances.

 1) Current reporting-period regulatory capital ratios are preliminary.  

 2) Basel III ratio definitions impacting risk-weighted assets and qualifying Basel III capital fully phase in as of January 1, 2018.  

At December 31, 2017, our Basel III capital ratios on a transitional basis remained well in excess of applicable regulatory requirements. Our CET1 capital ratio of 11.1% at December 31, 2017 compares with 11.1% at September 30, 2017 and 11.2% at December 31, 2016.  

Additionally, we expect to record a benefit for an anticipated FASB accounting change related to Tax Legislation that will be applicable to calendar 2017. The pro forma impact of this change would increase the CET1 ratio to 11.2% from 11.1%.

Overall credit quality remains strong, reflecting growth in high quality retail loans and broadly stable risk profile in commercial portfolios. Nonperforming loans and leases of $871 million decreased $61 million, or 7%, from September 30, 2017, primarily reflecting a decrease in commercial, driven by payoffs. Compared to December 31, 2016, nonperforming loans and leases decreased $174 million, or 17%, reflecting a $122 million decrease in commercial, driven by a reduction in nonperforming commodities-related credits, and a $52 million decrease in retail, largely in real-estate secured categories. The nonperforming loans and leases to total loans and leases ratio of 0.79% at December 31, 2017 improved six basis points from 0.85% at September 30, 2017 and improved 18 basis points from 0.97% at December 31, 2016.  

Net charge-offs of $78 million increased $13 million from third quarter 2017, reflecting an $2 million increase in commercial and an $11 million increase in retail largely driven by seasonality in auto and education, as well as growth in the retail unsecured portfolio. Compared with fourth quarter 2016, net charge-offs decreased $26 million, reflecting a $14 million decrease in commercial net charge-offs and a $12 million decrease in retail net charge-offs. Fourth quarter 2017 net charge-offs of 28 basis points of average loans and leases compares with 24 basis points in third quarter 2017 and 39 basis points in fourth quarter 2016.  

Allowance for loan and lease losses of $1.2 billion increased slightly compared to third quarter 2017, primarily reflecting growth and seasoning in the consumer unsecured portfolio. Allowance for loan and lease losses is stable compared with fourth quarter 2016 levels, reflecting strong overall credit quality that helped offset reserves to fund year-over-year loan growth.  

The ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases was 1.12% as of December 31, 2017, which was stable compared with 1.11% as of September 30, 2017 and down modestly from 1.15% as of December 31, 2016.

Noninterest income increased $2 million, or 1%, as higher trust and investment services fees were partially offset by seasonally lower card fees. Noninterest expense increased $6 million from third quarter 2017, given the impact of $9 million of notable items tied to growth initiatives largely in outside services, which includes costs tied to strategic growth initiatives.* Results also include an increase in occupancy and other operating expense, offset by seasonally lower marketing spend and salary and benefits expense. Excluding notable items, noninterest expense decreased $3 million from third quarter 2017.* Provision for credit losses increased $11 million from third quarter 2017, reflecting higher net charge-offs largely driven by seasonality in auto and education, as well as an increase for unsecured primarily tied to portfolio seasoning.

Compared to fourth quarter 2016, noninterest expense increased $5 million reflecting an increase in outside services and in salaries and benefits associated with growth initiatives, along with higher FDIC expense. These increases were partially offset by lower fraud and other losses. Excluding the notable items, noninterest expense decreased $4 million compared with fourth quarter 2016.* Provision for credit losses was stable compared with fourth quarter 2016, as higher consumer unsecured and education net charge-offs were partially offset by lower home equity and mortgage net charge-offs.

Net interest income increased $13 million, or 4%, versus third quarter 2017, reflecting strong deposit balance growth. Modest loan growth reflects growth in Mid-corporate, Private Equity and the impact of geographic expansion strategies, partially offset by planned runoff in the Asset Finance portfolio.

Noninterest expense was stable. Fourth quarter 2017 provision for credit losses remained stable versus third quarter 2017.  

Compared with fourth quarter 2016, net income increased $34 million, or 20%, driven by a $36 million increase in total revenue and a $21 million reduction in provision expense, partially offset by an $8 million increase in noninterest expense. Compared to fourth quarter 2016, net interest income increased $20 million, or 6%, as the benefit of 4% average loan and lease growth and improved loan yields was partially offset by higher deposit costs.

Noninterest expense increased $8 million, or 4%, reflecting higher salaries and benefits expense and outside services, partially offset by lower legal and regulatory expense.

Key Performance Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations  

(in millions, except share, per-share and ratio data)  

Key Performance Metrics:  

Our management team uses key performance metrics (KPMs) to gauge our performance and progress over time in achieving our strategic and operational goals and also in comparing our performance against our peers. We have established the following financial targets, in addition to others, as KPMs, which are utilized by our management in measuring our progress against financial goals and as a tool in helping assess performance for compensation purposes. These KPMs can largely be found in our periodic reports which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and are supplemented from time to time with additional information in connection with our quarterly earnings releases.  

Our key performance metrics include:  

Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE);  

Return on average total tangible assets (ROTA);  

Efficiency ratio;  

Operating leverage; and  

Common equity tier 1 capital ratio (U.S. Basel III Standardized fully phased-in basis).  

In establishing goals for these KPMs, we determined that they would be measured on a management-reporting basis, or an operating basis, which we refer to externally as “Adjusted” or “Underlying” results. We believe that these “Adjusted” or “Underlying” results provide the best representation of our financial progress toward these goals as they exclude items that our management does not consider indicative of our ongoing financial performance. KPMs that contain “Adjusted” or “Underlying” results are considered non-GAAP financial measures.  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:  

This document contains non-GAAP financial measures. The following tables present reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures. These reconciliations exclude “Adjusted” or “Underlying” items, which are included, where applicable, in the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. “Adjusted” or “Underlying” results, which are non-GAAP measures, exclude certain items, as applicable, that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of on-going financial performance.  

The non-GAAP measures presented in the following tables include reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and are: “noninterest income”, “total revenue”, “ noninterest expense”, “pre-provision profit”, “total credit-related costs”, “income before income tax expense”, “income tax expense”, “effective income tax rate”, “net income”, “net income available to common stockholders”, “other income”, “salaries and employee benefits”, “outside services”, “amortization of software expense”, “other operating expense”, “net income per average common share”, “return on average common equity” and “return on average total assets”.  

We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because these are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our “Adjusted” or “Underlying” results in any period do not reflect our operational performance in that period and, accordingly, it is useful to consider our GAAP results and our “Adjusted” or “Underlying” results together. We believe this presentation also increases comparability of period-to-period results.  

Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for our results as reported under GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements  

This document contains forward-looking statements within the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,” “targets,” “initiatives,” “potentially,” “probably,” “projects,” “outlook” or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” and “could.”  

Forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management, and on information currently available to management. Our statements speak as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ, materially, from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation:  

   •   negative economic conditions that adversely affect the general economy, housing prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits which may affect, among other things, the level of nonperforming assets, charge-offs and provision expense;  

   •   the rate of growth in the economy and employment levels, as well as general business and economic conditions;  

   •   our ability to implement our strategic plan, including the cost savings and efficiency components, and achieve our indicative performance targets;  

   •   our ability to remedy regulatory deficiencies and meet supervisory requirements and expectations;  

   •   liabilities and business restrictions resulting from litigation and regulatory investigations;  

   •   our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;  

   •   the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale;  

   •   changes in interest rates and market liquidity, as well as the magnitude of such changes, which may reduce interest margins, impact funding sources and affect the ability to originate and distribute financial products in the primary and secondary markets;  

   •   the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin;  

   •   financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation and regulation relating to bank products and services;  

   •   a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks; and  

   •   management’s ability to identify and manage these and other risks.  

25  

Citizens Financial Group, Inc.  

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or share repurchases will depend on our financial condition, earnings, cash needs, regulatory constraints, capital requirements (including requirements of our subsidiaries), and any other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock, or as to the amount of any such dividends.  

More information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on February 24, 2017.
