        "(b) Aetna estimates that as of December 31, 2017, it is entitled to receive a total of $314 million from HHS under the three-year ACA risk corridor program for the 2014 through 2016 program years. At December 31, 2017, Aetna did not record any ACA risk corridor receivables related to the 2016 or 2015 program years or any amount in excess of HHS's announced prorated funding amount for the 2014 program year, because payments from HHS are uncertain."
