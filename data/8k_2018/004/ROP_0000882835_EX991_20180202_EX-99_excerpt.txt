Roper Technologies Announces Record 2017 Financial Results

Fourth Quarter Revenue Increased 21% and Operating Cash Flow Increased 36%

Full Year Operating Cash Flow Increased to $1.23 Billion

Sarasota, Florida, February 2, 2018 ... Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: ROP), a diversified technology company, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.

Roper reports results - including revenue, gross margin, operating margin, net income, and diluted earnings per share (“DEPS”) - on a GAAP basis and an adjusted basis.

Fourth Quarter 2017

Fourth quarter GAAP and adjusted revenue increased 21% to $1.23 billion, and organic revenue grew 5%. GAAP gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 62.4% and adjusted gross margin expanded 30 basis points to 62.6%. 

GAAP DEPS was $4.27, and adjusted DEPS was $2.70, a 23% increase. Adjusted results exclude a one-time net gain of $215 million resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in addition to customary adjustments.

Adjusted EBITDA grew 21% to $441 million. Operating cash flow and free cash flow both increased 36% to $369 million and $353 million, respectively.

Full Year 2017

Full year GAAP revenue increased 22% to $4.61 billion and adjusted revenue grew 23% to $4.67 billion. GAAP gross margin expanded 70 basis points to 62.2% and adjusted gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 62.6%. 

Adjusted EBITDA grew 22% to $1.60 billion. Operating cash flow grew to $1.23 billion, a 28% increase and a 23% increase on an adjusted basis. 

“2017 was a remarkable year for Roper as our strategic focus on asset-light diversified technology businesses continued to drive shareholder value,’’ said Brian Jellison, Roper’s Chairman, President and CEO. “Cash flow performance across our operations was outstanding, helping us reduce debt by $1.06 billion and operate with negative working capital for the first time. Our strong organic revenue growth was enhanced by contributions from our large 2016 software acquisitions, Deltek and ConstructConnect, which exceeded our initial revenue and cash flow expectations for the year.”

2018 Outlook and Guidance

“The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will provide significant benefits for Roper,” said Mr. Jellison. “The expected decrease in our effective tax rate will lead to increases in both earnings and cash flow in 2018 and beyond. Furthermore, our ability to better access our cash worldwide will enable us to accelerate investment and continue pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities from a robust pipeline.”

Roper expects full year adjusted DEPS between $10.88 and $11.20 with first quarter adjusted DEPS between $2.44 and $2.50.

The Company’s guidance excludes the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures.
