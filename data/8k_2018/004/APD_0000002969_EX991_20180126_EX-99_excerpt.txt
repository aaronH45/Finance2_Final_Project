Exhibit 99.1

IMPACTS OF ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-07

Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (the “Company”) is filing this exhibit ("the Exhibit") to update certain financial information to reflect the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-07, "Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost." The Company elected to early adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and has applied the income statement presentation requirements retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company applied the practical expedient to use the amounts disclosed in its retirement benefits note for the prior comparative periods as the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements. 

Under the amended guidance, the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost continues to be presented in the same line items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. The other components of net periodic benefit cost (e.g., interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of actuarial gains or losses) have been removed from operating income and are now presented in the consolidated income statements in "Other non-operating income (expense), net."

This Exhibit includes the presentation of financial measures on a non-GAAP (“adjusted”) basis as well as a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to provide useful information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures, when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. In evaluating these financial measures, the reader should be aware that we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation in the future. Investors should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.

We define adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests) excluding certain disclosed items, which the Company does not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful metric for management to assess operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by sales.
