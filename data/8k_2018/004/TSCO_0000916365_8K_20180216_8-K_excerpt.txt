The facility had an original scheduled maturity of February 19, 2021 but, subject to the provisions of the Credit Agreement, including a requirement that no more than two such extensions be exercised, each lender thereunder may elect to extend the maturity date of its commitments and loans by one year following a request for such extension by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Company has exercised its first extension option, and on February 16, 2018, the maturity date on all of the existing loans under the Credit Agreement was extended by an additional year to February 19, 2022, except for the maturity date of the term loan under the Incremental Term Loan Agreement dated June 15, 2017 which remains June 15, 2022.

The foregoing summary is qualified by reference to the copy of the Credit Agreement attached as Exhibit 10.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on February 23, 2016, the full text of which is incorporated herein by reference.
