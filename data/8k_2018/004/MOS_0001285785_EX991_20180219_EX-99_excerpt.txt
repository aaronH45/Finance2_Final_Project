THE MOSAIC COMPANY REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND 

FULL-YEAR 2017 RESULTS 

Records a $458 million non-cash charge

related to changes in U.S. tax legislation

PLYMOUTH, MN, February 19, 2017 - The Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS) today reported a fourth quarter 2017 net loss of $431 million, compared to net income of $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter loss per share was $1.23, which included a negative impact of $1.57 per share from notable items, primarily related to non-cash charges as a result of changes in U.S. tax legislation. Adjusted earnings per share during the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.341. 

“After a strong fourth quarter, we entered 2018 with positive market momentum and expect this year will be a transformational year for Mosaic,” said Joc O’Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The addition of Vale Fertilizantes, the construction completion of the Ma’aden phosphate project and progress on the Esterhazy K3 complex further enhance our position as a world class, global fertilizer company.” 

Mosaic’s net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.1 billion, compared to $1.9 billion last year, primarily driven by higher realized prices throughout the business. Operating earnings during the quarter were $127 million, up from $74 million a year ago, driven by higher gross margins in both Potash and Phosphates. 

Cash flow provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $411 million compared to $323 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures totaled $230 million in the quarter. Mosaic’s total cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, were $2.2 billion and long-term debt was $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2017. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company used $1.08 billion in cash to close the acquisition of Vale Fertilizantes and pre-paid $200 million on an outstanding term loan.

“We delivered solid operational performance across our three businesses during the fourth quarter,” said Joc O’Rourke. “Now that the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition is closed, our focus shifts to delivering the targeted $275 million of synergies and operational improvements from the combined Brazil businesses. We are confident in our ability to execute and get back to our through-cycle balance sheet targets by the end of 2020.” 

Phosphates

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net sales in the Phosphates segment were $1.0 billion for the fourth quarter, up from $896 million last year, driven by higher average realized sales prices. Gross margin was $133 million, or 13 percent of net sales, compared to $84 million, or nine percent of net sales, for the same period a year ago. The increase in the fourth quarter gross margin per tonne to $53 from $34 in the prior year period was primarily driven by higher realized sales prices and lower phosphate rock costs, partially offset by higher ammonia and sulfur costs. 

The fourth quarter average DAP selling price, FOB plant, was $348 per tonne, compared to $317 per tonne a year ago. Phosphates segment total sales volumes were 2.5 million tonnes, flat with last year. 

Mosaic’s North American finished phosphate production was 2.3 million tonnes, or 79 percent of operational capacity, compared to 2.5 million tonnes, or 84 percent of operating capacity, during the fourth quarter of 2016. Mosaic’s Plant City, Florida chemical plant was temporarily idled on December 10, 2017.

Potash

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net sales in the Potash segment totaled $496 million for the fourth quarter, up from $407 million last year, driven by higher average realized sales prices and higher sales volumes. Gross margin was $114 million, or 23 percent of net sales, compared to $66 million, or 16 percent of net sales a year ago. The improvement in gross margin per tonne to $51 from $33 in the prior year period is primarily driven by higher average realized sales prices, partially offset by higher production costs as a result of an increase in production at the higher cost Colonsay mine and planned maintenance at the lower cost Esterhazy mine. 

The fourth quarter average MOP selling price, FOB plant, was $188 per tonne, up from $169 per tonne a year ago. The Potash segment’s total sales volumes for the fourth quarter were 2.2 million tonnes, up from 2.0 million tonnes last year. 

Potash production for the fourth quarter was 2.1 million tonnes, or 87 percent of operational capacity, up from 82 percent last year when the Company’s Colonsay mine was temporarily idled. 

International Distribution (ID)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net sales in the International Distribution segment were $713 million for the fourth quarter, up from $684 million last year, driven by higher average realized selling prices. Gross margin was $45 million, or $24 per tonne, compared to $59 million, or $31 per tonne for the same period a year ago. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin per tonne is driven by a decline in blending margins in Brazil as a result of competitive pressures. 

The fourth quarter average selling price was $370 per tonne, compared to $354 per tonne a year ago. International Distribution segment total sales volumes were 1.9 million tonnes, flat with last year’s levels. 

Other 

Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses were $83 million for the fourth quarter, up from $75 million last year, in part as a result of bad debt expense of $4 million in the International Distribution business. 

Impact of changes in U.S. tax legislation

The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in a non-cash $458 million charge during the fourth quarter of 2017. Additionally, while the Company’s long term, through-cycle tax rate is expected to decline marginally from the low 20 percent range, Mosaic anticipates an approximate $200 million reduction in cash taxes paid over the next five year period. The estimated effective tax rate for 2018 is in the 20 percent range.

Full-year 2017 results (unaudited)

For the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, net loss was $107 million, or $0.31 per share, compared to net earnings of $298 million, or $0.85 per share in 2016. Full-year adjusted earnings per share of $1.09 exclude the negative impact of a $1.40 of notable items, primarily related to non-cash charges as a result of the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. The $458 million non-cash charge is driven by the revaluation of our tax assets as of December 31, 2017. Net sales were $7.4 billion, up from $7.2 billion a year ago. Full-year operating earnings were $466 million, up from $319 million last year, primarily driven by higher average realized sales prices and higher sales volumes in potash. 

Full-year selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $301 million, the lowest in eight years reflecting on-going progress on cost savings initiatives. Net cash provided by operating activities was $936 million and capital expenditures including investments in MWSPC were $883 million.

Financial Guidance

“We are optimistic about 2018,” O’Rourke said. “We are seeing improving market conditions in both potash and phosphates, which, combined with benefits from our actions across our three business units, puts Mosaic in an excellent position to create value for all of our stakeholders.”

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release includes the presentation and discussion of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance, or adjusted EPS. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a supplemental numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because non-GAAP measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, they are thus susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted net earnings per share, excluding the impact of notable items. Notable items impact on diluted net earnings per share is calculated as notable item amount plus income tax effect, based on expected annual effective tax rate, divided by diluted weighted average shares. Management believes that adjusted EPS provides securities analysts, investors and others, in addition to management, with useful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results. Management utilizes adjusted EPS in analyzing and assessing Mosaic’s overall performance, for financial and operating decision-making, and to forecast and plan for the future periods. Adjusted EPS also assists our management in comparing our and our competitors' operating results. 

We are not providing forward looking guidance for U.S. GAAP reported diluted net earnings per share or a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking adjusted EPS because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty our notable items without unreasonable effort. Historically, our notable items have included, but are not limited to, foreign currency transaction gain or loss, unrealized gain or loss on derivatives, acquisition-related fees, discrete tax items, contingencies and certain other gains or losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the guidance period. Reconciliations of adjusted EPS to diluted net earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 and full-year 2017 are provided below. Reconciliations for historical periods beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2016 are provided under “Consolidated Data” in the Selected Calendar Quarter Financial Information performance data for the related periods. This information is available on our website at www.mosaicco.com in the “Financial Information - Quarterly Earnings” section under the “Investors” tab.
