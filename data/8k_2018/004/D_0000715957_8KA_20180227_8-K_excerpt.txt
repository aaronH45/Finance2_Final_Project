EXPLANATORY NOTE  

This report amends the Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 29, 2018 (the Original Filing) filed by Dominion Energy, Inc. announcing preliminary unaudited earnings for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The sole purpose of this amendment is to disclose the changes to the information included in the Original Filing as described in

 Item 2.02 below.  

 Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition  

On January 29, 2018, Dominion Energy, Inc. issued a press release announcing preliminary unaudited earnings for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The press release and related preliminary earnings tables were furnished with the Original Filing as Exhibit 99. Subsequently, in connection with the preparation of the audited financial statements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, Dominion Energy concluded that revisions to its accounting for the remeasurement of deferred taxes resulting from the 2017 U.S. tax reform act were appropriate, resulting in a reduction of Dominion Energy’s preliminarily announced net income attributable to Dominion Energy for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 from $1,449 million to $1,312 million and from $3,136 million to $2,999 million, respectively. Corresponding adjustments were made in net income per share for these periods. The adjustments did not affect Dominion Energy’s previously announced non-GAAP operating earnings for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 or Dominion Energy’s operating earnings guidance for 2018 as disclosed in the January 29, 2018 press release.  

On February 27, 2018, Dominion Energy will publish on its investor information page at www.dominionenergy.com/investors, a Revised 4Q 17 Earnings Release Kit, a Revised 2018 Earnings Guidance Kit and certain supplemental schedules and GAAP reconciliations incorporating the adjustment to the charges associated with the 2017 tax reform act. Information contained on Dominion Energy’s website is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute part of, this Current Report on Form 8-K/A.  

Updates to the related earnings tables that were included in the January 29, 2017 press release are furnished with this Current Report as Exhibit 99.
