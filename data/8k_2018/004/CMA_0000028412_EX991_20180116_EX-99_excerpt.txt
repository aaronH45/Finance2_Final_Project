"Comerica made significant forward progress in 2017," said Ralph W. Babb, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. “Revenue grew 11 percent, including a 15 percent increase in net interest income, which benefited from higher interest rates as we prudently managed loan and deposit pricing. In addition, successful execution of our GEAR Up initiative helped increase fee income 5 percent and lowered expenses 4 percent. We continued to adeptly navigate the energy cycle, and credit quality remained strong. Altogether, this drove an 84 percent increase in pre-tax income.

"Our fourth quarter pre-tax income was stable compared to the previous quarter," said Babb. "Relative to the third quarter, the benefit from higher interest rates and loan growth was offset by a decline in interest recoveries, which were significantly elevated in the third quarter. Credit metrics were strong, with 13 basis points of net charge-offs. Fee income grew 4 percent with increases in almost every category. In conjunction with revenue growth, expenses were up, yet remained well controlled. Finally, we are distributing some of the benefits from the tax reform act to our hardworking team. We granted approximately 4,500 colleagues a one-time bonus of $1,000 and raised our minimum wage to $15 per hour, which impacts over 700 employees. 

"As we look forward to the year ahead, we remain focused on further enhancing shareholder value by growing relationships, continued implementation of our GEAR Up initiatives and returning excess capital to our investors. The full-year impact of the 2017 rate increases should help drive further revenue growth. Also, we expect to benefit from the lower tax rate, and we are well positioned to take advantage of additional interest rate increases, favorable changes in regulation and economic growth."

Full-Year 2018 Outlook

For full-year 2018 compared to full-year 2017, management expects the following, assuming a continuation of the current economic and low rate environment as well as approximately $270 million of benefits from the GEAR Up initiative:

•Average loans higher in line with Gross Domestic Product, reflecting increases in most lines of business while remaining stable in Energy and Corporate Banking.

•Net interest income higher, reflecting full-year benefits from the 2017 rate increases and loan growth.

◦Full-year benefit from 2017 rate increases expected to be $110 million to $125 million, assuming a 20 percent to 40 percent deposit beta for the December rate increase.

◦Elevated interest recoveries of $28 million in 2017 not expected to repeat in 2018.

•Provision for credit losses of 15 basis points to 25 basis points and net charge-offs to remain low, with continued solid performance of the overall portfolio.

•Excluding deferred compensation of $8 million in 2017, noninterest income higher by 4 percent1, benefiting from the continued execution of GEAR Up opportunities helping to drive growth in treasury management income, card fees, brokerage fees and fiduciary income. 

•Noninterest expenses higher by 1 percent1, reflecting $47 million to $57 million in restructuring charges and an additional $50 million benefit from the GEAR Up initiatives. Additionally, headwinds include higher technology expenditures and typical inflationary pressures, as well as outside processing expenses to increase in line with growing revenue.

•Income tax expense to approximate 23 percent of pre-tax income with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts, assuming no tax impact from employee stock transactions.

1 Beginning January 1, 2018, as a result of adopting a new accounting standard, card fee revenue from certain card products will be presented net of network costs in noninterest income, as opposed to the current presentation of associated network costs in noninterest expenses. Other smaller revenue streams will be similarly impacted. These changes in presentation will not impact net income and are not reflected in this outlook. Management expects the efficiency ratio to improve 150 basis points to 200 basis points as a result of these changes. Costs impacted by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 were approximately $120 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (unaudited)

Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries     

Comerica believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and performance trends. Comerica believes adjusted net income, earnings per share, ROA and ROE provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhances comparability of results with prior periods. Tangible common equity is used by Comerica to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Adjusted net income, earnings per share, ROA and ROE remove the after tax effect of restructuring charges and one-time employee bonuses, the charge to adjust deferred taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and tax benefits from employee stock transactions from net income and net income available to common shareholders.

21

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders equity per share of common stock.
