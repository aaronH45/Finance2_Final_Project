Consolidated net sales of $3.5 billion and $12.4 billion increased 10.0% and 9.9% as reported in the quarter and full year and 8.7% and 9.8% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by 1.2% and 0.1%. Excluding the 0.7% and 2.7% impact of acquisitions, net sales increased 8.1% and 7.1% in constant currency, including 9.1% and 8.2% from increased unit volumes partially offset by 1.0% and 1.1% in lower prices.

Orthopaedics net sales of $1.3 billion and $4.7 billion increased 8.1% and 6.6% as reported in the quarter and full year and 6.8% and 6.5% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by 1.3% and 0.1%. There was no impact of acquisitions in the quarter and 0.3% impact of acquisitions in the full year. Net sales increased 6.8% and 6.2% excluding acquisitions and in constant currency, including 9.3% and 8.6% from increased unit volumes partially offset by 2.5% and 2.4% in lower prices.

MedSurg net sales of $1.6 billion and $5.6 billion increased 10.9% and 13.6% as reported in the quarter and full year and 9.8% and 13.4% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by 1.1% and 0.2%. Excluding the 1.3% and 5.6% impact of acquisitions, net sales increased 8.5% and 7.8% in constant currency, including 8.0% and 7.5% from increased unit volumes and 0.5% and 0.2% from higher prices.

Excluding the 0.4% and 0.7% impact of acquisitions, net sales increased 10.0% and 7.6% in constant currency, including 11.7% and 9.1% from increased unit volumes partially offset by 1.7% and 1.5% in lower prices.

Earnings Analysis

Reported net earnings decreased 148.9% in the quarter to a net loss of $249 million and reported net earnings decreased 38.1% to $1,020 million in the full year. Reported net earnings per diluted share decreased 149.3% in the quarter to a net loss per diluted share of $0.66 and reported net earnings per diluted share decreased 38.4% to $2.68 in the full year. Reported net earnings includes charges for the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring-related activities, Rejuvenate and ABG II recall, and acquisition and integration related activities. The effect of each of these matters on reported net earnings and net earnings per diluted share appears in the reconciliation of actual results to adjusted results. Excluding the impact of these charges increases gross profit margin in the quarter from 64.5% to 66.4% and for the full year from 65.7% to 66.3% and increases operating income margin in the quarter from 20.5% to 27.0% and for the full year from 18.4% to 25.2%.

Excluding the impact of the items described above, adjusted net earnings(2) of $746 million and $2,465 million increased 10.5% and 12.3%, in the quarter and full year. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share(1) of $1.96 and $6.49 increased 10.1% and 11.9% in the quarter and full year.

2018 Outlook 

We expect 2018 organic sales growth to be in the range of 6.0% to 6.5%. For 2018, we will adopt ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which impacts the timing of revenue recognition and requires the presentation of certain costs previously reported as selling expenses as a reduction of revenue, both of which are not anticipated to be material. The reclassification of selling costs will result in a reduction of net sales, but has no impact on operating income or net earnings. We expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share(3) to be in the range of $1.57 to $1.62 in the first quarter and $7.07 to $7.17 in the full year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales to be favorably impacted by approximately 1.0% for the full year. When considered along with our hedging program, we expect modest favorability in net earnings per diluted share in the first quarter and full year.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; cost of sales excluding specified items; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted operating income; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; and adjusted net earnings per diluted share. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. 

To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. 

Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, operating income, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures:
