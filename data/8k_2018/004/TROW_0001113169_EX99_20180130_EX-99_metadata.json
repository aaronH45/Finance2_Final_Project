        " 13 Three months ended Year ended 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 Net investment income $ (2.9 ) $ 68.1 $ 121.1 $ 193.9 Operating expenses (3.1 ) (3.8 ) (13.0 ) (12.3 ) Net income (6.0 ) 64.3 108.1 181.6 Less: net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests (13.0 ) 39.5 39.0 83.4 T. Rowe Price Group's portion of net income $ 7.0 $ 24.8 $ 69.1 $ 98.2 (2) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the impact of market movements on the supplemental savings plan liability and related investments designated as economic hedges of the liability beginning July 1, 2017. Amounts deferred under the supplemental savings plan are adjusted for appreciation (depreciation) of hypothetical investments chosen by the employees. Since the firm economically hedges the exposure to these market movements, management believes it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income earned on the hedges against the related compensation expense to increase comparability period to period. The following table details the supplemental savings plan related items: Three months ended Year ended 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 Non-operating income of investments designated as an economic hedge of supplemental savings plan liability $ — $ 6.2 $ — $ 12.3 Compensation expense from market valuation changes in supplemental savings plan liability — (6.0 ) — (11.7 ) Non-operating income of investments designated as an economic hedge of supplemental savings plan liability less compensation expense $ — $ .2 $ — $ .6 (3) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the non-operating income that remains after eliminating the portion related to the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products and investments designated as an economic hedge of the firm's supplemental savings plan liability. Management believes excluding non-operating income helps the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results and increases comparability to prior years. Additionally, management does not emphasize the impact of non-operating income when managing the firm and evaluating its performance. The following table details the calculation of other non-operating income: Three months ended Year ended 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 12/31/2017 Total non-operating income $ 12.2 $ 102.0 $ 227.1 $ 396.3 Less: net investment income of consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products (2.9 ) 68.1 121.1 193.9 Less: non-operating income from investments designated as an economic hedge of supplemental savings plan liability — 6.2 — 12.3 Total other non-operating income $ 15.1 $ 27.7 $ 106.0 $ 190.1 (4) In the second quarter of 2016, the firm recognized a nonrecurring charge of $166.2 million related to the firm's decision to compensate certain clients in regard to the Dell appraisal rights matter. The firm also recognized an offset to this charge during the fourth quarter of 2016 for related insurance recoveries totaling $100 million. In the first quarter of 2017, the firm recognized additional insurance recoveries of $50 million as a reduction in operating expenses from claims that were filed in relation to the matter. Management believes it is useful to readers of the firm's consolidated statements of income to adjust for these charges and non-recurring insurance recoveries in arriving at adjusted operating expenses and net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group and diluted earnings per share. (5) These were calculated using the effective tax rate applicable to each non-GAAP adjustment before tax reform. (6) In the fourth quarter of 2017, the firm recognized a nonrecurring charge of $71.1 million to reflect the effect of the U.S. tax law changes enacted on December 22, 2017. Management believes it is useful to readers of the firm's consolidated statements of income to adjust for this nonrecurring charge in arriving at net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group and diluted earnings per share. (7) This non-GAAP measure was calculated by applying the two-class method to adjusted net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution."
