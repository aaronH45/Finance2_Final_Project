FALLS CHURCH, Va. – Jan. 25, 2018 – Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) reported fourth quarter 2017 sales increased 4 percent to $6.6 billion from $6.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. For 2017, sales increased 5 percent to $25.8 billion from $24.5 billion in 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 net earnings totaled $178 million, or $1.01 per share, compared with $525 million, or $2.96 per share, in the prior year period. For 2017, net earnings totaled $2.0 billion compared with $2.2 billion in 2016. Fourth quarter and full-year 2017 net earnings were reduced by higher tax expense resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Tax Act") and the company's related $500 million discretionary pre-tax pension contribution, which together reduced net earnings by $317 million, or $1.81 per share, in both periods, primarily related to the write-down of deferred tax assets. 

“Our strong financial results reflect our continued focus on delivering top performance for our shareholders, customers and employees. All three of our businesses generated excellent results that contributed to this year's strong sales, operating profit and cash flow. Looking ahead, we continue to invest in our businesses and our employees, as we strengthen the foundation for long-term profitable growth," said Wes Bush, chairman and chief executive officer.

Table 1 — Consolidated Operating Results Highlights

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-GAAP measure — see definitions at the end of this earnings release.

Fourth quarter 2017 sales increased 4 percent, due to higher sales in Mission Systems and Aerospace Systems. Fourth quarter operating income and margin rate totaled $767 million and 11.6 percent, compared with $831 million and 13.0 percent in the prior year period. The decline in operating income is primarily due to higher unallocated corporate expenses and lower segment operating income, partially offset by higher net FAS/CAS pension adjustment. The $80 million increase in unallocated corporate expenses includes $20 million of transaction costs related to the pending acquisition of Orbital ATK, as well as $23 million of deferred state tax expense principally related to the company's discretionary pension contribution. Lower segment operating income and operating margin rate are primarily due to changes in contract mix at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems.

For 2017, sales increased 5 percent due to higher sales in Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems, and operating income increased 3 percent. 2017 operating income reflects increases in sales, net FAS/CAS pension adjustment and segment operating income, partially offset by higher unallocated corporate expenses. Unallocated corporate expenses increased $197 million and include $47 million for transaction costs related to the pending Orbital ATK acquisition and $41 million of deferred state tax expense and state tax adjustments associated with the filing of the company's prior year federal tax return. In addition, the prior year included benefits totaling $60 million for state tax refunds and prior year overhead claim recoveries.

Fourth quarter and full year 2017 interest expense each increased by $59 million. In October 2017, the company issued $8.25 billion of debt to finance its pending acquisition of Orbital ATK. Fourth quarter Other, net increased $59 million due to a $24 million increase in interest income on short-term investments and a gain on the sale of an investment. For 2017, Other, net increased $79 million, due to gains on the sale of two investments and a $29 million increase in interest income on short-term investments.

The company's fourth quarter effective tax rate increased to 74.0 percent from 29.8 percent in the prior year period. For 2017, the company's effective tax rate increased to 33.9 percent from 24.7 percent in 2016. The higher effective tax rates for both periods reflect an additional $300 million of tax expense principally due to a write-down of net deferred tax assets related to the 2017 Tax Act, which, among other things, reduced the federal statutory tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent beginning in 2018.

The Autonomous Systems sales increase includes higher volume for several programs, including Fire Scout and Triton, partially offset by lower volume on the Global Hawk program. Lower Space sales are primarily due to lower volume for the James Webb Space Telescope. 

For 2017, sales increased 10 percent due to growth in Manned Aircraft, Autonomous Systems and Space. Higher Manned Aircraft sales were primarily due to an increase in restricted activities. Higher Autonomous Systems sales reflect higher volume for several programs, including Triton, partially offset by lower volume on NATO AGS. Higher Space sales were primarily due to increases in restricted activities, partially offset by declines in the James Webb Space Telescope and Advanced EHF programs.

2018 Guidance

2018 financial guidance reflects the company's judgment based on the information available to the company at the time of this release. The government budget and appropriations processes can impact our customers, programs and financial results. Extended continuing resolutions, a prolonged government shutdown and/or breach of the debt ceiling, as well as government budgets and appropriations, can impact the company's ability to achieve 2018 guidance. 

While the company currently expects its previously announced acquisition of Orbital ATK will close in the first half of this year, 2018 guidance does not reflect the pending acquisition. Additionally, 2018 guidance reflects only six months of interest on the $8.25 billion of debt issued in October 2017 to finance the acquisition. After the close of the acquisition, the company will update its financial guidance to reflect the acquisition.

Effective January 1, 2018, the company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-07, Compensation Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, using the full retrospective method for each. The 2018 guidance in the table below reflects the adoption of both standards. Schedules 6 and 7 at the end of this release present comparable prior period consolidated and segment financial information recast to reflect the adoption of these standards.
