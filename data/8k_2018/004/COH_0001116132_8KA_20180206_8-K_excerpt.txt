Explanatory Note 

On February 6, 2018, Tapestry, Inc. (“Tapestry” or the “Company”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Current Report on Form 8-K, dated February 6, 2018 (the “Form 8-K”). The Form 8-K inadvertently omitted a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures for Tapestry for the quarters ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and included a duplicative reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures for Tapestry for the six months ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. This was due to a technical error made by a filing service when converting the document for filing. The purpose of this Current Report on Form 8-K/A is to correct this error.
