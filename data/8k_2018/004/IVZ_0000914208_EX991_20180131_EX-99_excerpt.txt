(2)As of December 31, 2017, the company changed the presentation of long-term inflows, outflows and AUM to exclude Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) and product leverage. All periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. Non-management fee earning AUM includes Invesco PowerShares QQQ, UITs and product leverage.

Operating Results - year ended December 31, 2017

This section discusses the company's full year 2017 results, as compared to 2016, and comments on significant items that have impacted the company's results as presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The results of the acquired European ETF business are included from the acquisition date of August 18, 2017.

Operating revenues increased $425.9 million (9.0%) to $5,160.3 million in 2017, from $4,734.4 million in 2016, primarily due to increased investment management fees. Investment management fees increased by $353.5 million (9.4%) to $4,126.6 million in 2017, from $3,773.1 million in 2016 due to 10.9% higher average AUM. Foreign exchange rate changes decreased operating revenues by $35.3 million compared to 2016. Performance fees increased $69.0 million (155.8%) to $113.3 million in 2017 from $44.3 million in 2016, primarily related to the performance fee generated in the third quarter by Invesco's Mortgage Recovery Fund.

Operating expenses increased $325.2 million (9.1%) to $3,883.2 million in 2017, from $3,558.0 million in 2016, primarily due to increased employee compensation and third-party distribution, service and advisory costs. Foreign exchange rate changes decreased 2017 operating expenses by $21.2 million when compared to 2016. Business optimization charges increased to $58.0 million in 2017, compared to $49.9 million in 2016. As of the end of 2017, this initiative has produced annualized run-rate expense savings of $43.8 million. These savings have helped offset acquisition and regulatory-related increases in operating expenses.

Non-operating income and expense includes equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $44.7 million in 2017 primarily from our private equity and real estate investments as well as our Chinese joint ventures. Also included in non-operating income is other income of consolidated investment products (CIP), net of $137.3 million in 2017 as compared to $79.2 million in 2016.

Operating revenues increased 2.8% to $1,375.6 million in the fourth quarter, from $1,337.7 million in the third quarter 2017. The change was primarily due to increased investment management fees. Foreign exchange rate changes increased operating revenues by $2.7 million compared to the third quarter 2017. 

Investment management fees increased by $36.4 million (3.4%) to $1,098.7 million in the fourth quarter, from $1,062.3 million in the third quarter 2017, due to an increase of 4.4% in average AUM between the periods.

Service and distribution fees decreased $0.1 million (0.0%) to $217.5 million in the fourth quarter, from $217.6 million in the third quarter 2017. 

Performance fees were $43.0 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $42.3 million in the third quarter 2017. Performance fees recorded in the fourth quarter arose primarily from real estate and bank loan products. 

Other revenues increased by $0.9 million (5.8%) to $16.4 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $15.5 million in the third quarter 2017, primarily resulting from increased real estate transaction fees.

Operating expenses increased $48.9 million (5.0%) to $1,031.3 million in the fourth quarter, from $982.4 million in the third quarter 2017. Business optimization charges were $9.0 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $12.3 million in the third quarter.

Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $10.5 million (2.8%) to $390.9 million in the fourth quarter, from $380.4 million in the third quarter 2017, consistent with the increase in revenues resulting from the increase in retail AUM. 

Employee compensation expenses decreased by $11.2 million (2.8%) to $381.9 million in the fourth quarter, from $393.1 million in the third quarter 2017. Staff severance costs related to business optimization were $2.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to $7.6 million in the third quarter. Third quarter compensation costs also included a $5.5 million non-cash charge related to the company's U.K. defined benefit plan. The fourth quarter also includes a decrease in variable compensation costs. 

Marketing expenses increased by $11.2 million (38.0%) to $40.7 million in the fourth quarter from $29.5 million in the third quarter 2017 reflecting marketing campaigns related to the acquired European ETF business, cross-border funds and normal seasonal increases in advertising, client events and other marketing costs. 

Property, office and technology expenses increased $10.0 million (10.8%) to $102.8 million in the fourth quarter, from $92.8 million in the third quarter 2017 primarily related to increased outsourced administration and software costs. 

4

General and administrative expenses increased $28.4 million (32.8%) to $115.0 million in the fourth quarter, from $86.6 million in the third quarter 2017. General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter included $15.6 million of legal, other professional services fees and amortization related to acquisitions compared to $6.9 million in the third quarter 2017. The fourth quarter also includes increases of $9.3 million primarily related to regulatory changes and business growth initiatives, including product costs and other legal and consulting costs. Increased costs in the fourth quarter also led to an increase of $1.7 million in irrecoverable taxes as compared to the third quarter.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $9.3 million (72.1%) to $3.6 million in the fourth quarter from $12.9 million in the third quarter 2017 primarily due to a decrease in earnings from partnership investments. Non-operating other income and expenses in the fourth quarter also included a $44.8 million consolidated investment product (CIP) net gain comprised of market-driven gains and losses on investments held by the consolidated funds and net interest income of CIP (third quarter 2017: $31.7 million gain).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Taxation

Our effective tax rate decreased to 18.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and to (5.8%) for the fourth quarter (year ended December 31, 2016: 28.0%; third quarter 2017: 31.0%). The decreases reflect a 9.3% rate decrease for the year and a 33.9% rate decrease for the fourth quarter as a result of a $130.7 million tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) enacted in the United States. 

The inclusion of income from non-controlling interests decreased our effective tax rate 0.5% in 2017 and increased our effective tax rate by 0.2% in the fourth quarter (year ended December 31, 2016: decrease of 0.3%; third quarter 2017: decrease of 0.5%). Third quarter 2017 included a 3.5% rate increase as a result of Illinois tax regulation changes adopted in the quarter. 

The impact of the 2017 Tax Act may differ from the estimate recorded this quarter due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions that company has made as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued. 

Capital Management

Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliations

We utilize the following non-GAAP performance measures: net revenues (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM), adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd., and adjusted diluted EPS. We believe the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into our ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to our competitors. These measures also assist management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts and assist the Board of Directors and management in determining incentive compensation decisions. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on AUM), operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Invesco Ltd., and diluted EPS. 

The following are reconciliations of operating revenues, operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. (and by calculation, diluted EPS) on a U.S. GAAP basis to a non-GAAP basis of net revenues, adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS). In addition, a reconciliation of adjusted operating expenses is provided below, together with reconciliations of the U.S. GAAP operating expense lines to provide further analysis of the non-GAAP adjustments. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any U.S. GAAP measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The tax effect of the reconciling items is based on the tax jurisdiction attributable to the transactions. These measures are described more fully in the company's Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Refer to these public filings for additional information about the company's non-GAAP performance measures.

Footnotes to the Assets Under Management Tables

(a) Reinvested dividends and capital gains of $5.9 billion and $1.1 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 respectively, are included in long-term inflows. For previous periods, reinvested dividends and capital gains are included in market gains and losses.

(b) As of December 31, 2017, the company changed the presentation of long-term inflows, outflows and AUM to exclude Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) and product leverage. All periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. Non-management fee earning AUM includes Invesco PowerShares QQQ, UITs and product leverage. 

(c) Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding China joint venture (JV) AUM. For quarterly AUM, our share of the average AUM in the fourth quarter for our JVs in China was $9.1 billion (third quarter 2017: $8.6 billion; fourth quarter 2016: $10.1 billion). For year-to-date AUM, our share of the average AUM in the twelve months of 2017 for our JVs in China was $8.5 billion (twelve months of 2016: $9.2 billion). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our China JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the net income of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, is not considered a meaningful effective fee rate measure. The numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from CIP; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM. 

(d) Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM. See the reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Information on pages 9 through 12 of this release for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.

(e) The alternatives asset class includes absolute return, commodities, currencies, financial structures, global macro, long/short equity, managed futures, multi-alternatives, private capital - direct, private capital - fund of funds, private direct real estate, public real estate securities, senior secured loans and custom solutions. 

(f) Long-term AUM excludes institutional money market and non-management fee earning AUM. Ending AUM as of December 31, 2017 includes $74.0 billion in institutional money market AUM and $87.8 billion in non-management fee earning AUM (September 30, 2017: $77.1 billion and $82.7 billion, respectively; December 31, 2016: $70.9 billion and $71.3 billion, respectively). 

(g) Passive AUM includes ETFs, UITs, certain non-fee earning leverage and other passive mandates. Active AUM are total AUM less Passive AUM.

(h) In January 2017 the company reclassified $3.0 billion of certain AUM previously classified in fixed income to money market.
