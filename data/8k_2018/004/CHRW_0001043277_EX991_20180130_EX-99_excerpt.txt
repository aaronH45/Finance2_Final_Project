FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

C.H. ROBINSON REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS

MINNEAPOLIS, January 30, 2018 - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (“C.H. Robinson”) (NASDAQ: CHRW), today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. This table of summary results presents our service line net revenues consistent with our historical presentation and is on an enterprise basis. The service line net revenues in the table differ from the segment service line net revenues discussed below as our segments have revenues from multiple service lines. Summarized financial results are set forth in the following table (dollars in thousands, except per share data).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our total revenues increased 16.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in total revenues was driven by increased customer pricing, volume, and fuel costs in most of our transportation services. Our total net revenues increased 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. 

For the fourth quarter of 2017, our total operating expenses increased 14.4 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Personnel expenses increased 19.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in personnel expenses was the result of an increase in average headcount of 6.8 percent and an increase in variable compensation in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 1.6 percent. 

Interest and other expenses increased approximately $14.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest expense increased due to a higher average debt balance and higher interest rates during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The higher average debt balance is a result of borrowings for the acquisition of Milgram and increased working capital needs. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we had approximately $4 million in currency gains, primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar.

The provision for income taxes decreased 40.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the provision for income taxes decreased by $19.7 million due to the benefit of deductions under Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code and $12.1 million due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The $12.1 million benefit resulting from Tax Reform was primarily the result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the decrease in the corporate Federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and was partially offset by the impact of certain transition taxes and other impacts of Tax Reform. 

Results by Segment

Our three reportable segments are: North American Surface Transportation (“NAST”), Global Forwarding, and Robinson Fresh. The balance of our business is reported as “All Other and Corporate.” All Other and Corporate includes our non-reportable segments, including Managed Services and Other Surface Transportation. 

NAST provides freight transportation services across North America through a network of offices in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The primary services provided by NAST include truckload, less than truckload (“LTL”), and intermodal. Summarized financial results of our NAST segment are as follows (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NAST total revenues increased 14.8 percent to $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was driven by pricing increases in all services. NAST net revenues increased 14.3 percent to $415.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $363.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily from an increase in truckload net revenues. 

NAST truckload net revenues increased 16.6 percent to $304.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $261.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, while truckload volumes declined 3 percent. NAST truckload net revenue margin was flat in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.

NAST accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total North America truckload net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 93 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. The majority of the remaining North American truckload net revenues is included in Robinson Fresh. Excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel prices, our average North America truckload rate per mile charged to our customers increased approximately 15 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Our truckload transportation costs increased approximately 14.5 percent, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel prices. 

NAST LTL net revenues increased 10.9 percent to $100.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $90.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. NAST LTL volumes increased approximately 10 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and net revenue margin decreased.

NAST intermodal net revenues decreased 34.4 percent to $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. NAST intermodal net revenues and net revenue margin decreased while volume increased in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to higher costs on owned and leased containers.

NAST operating expenses increased 14.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $234.8 million compared to $205.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was due to increases in personnel expenses. The increase in personnel expenses is related to an increase in variable compensation in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase in average headcount of 1.0 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The operating expenses of NAST and all other segments include allocated corporate expenses.

Global Forwarding operating expenses increased 24.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $111.0 million from $89.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was due to increases in both personnel and selling, general, and administrative expenses. The personnel expense increase was driven by an average headcount increase of 19.0 percent. The acquisition of Milgram added approximately 7.5 percent to Global Forwarding average headcount. The selling, general, and administrative expense increase was primarily driven by the addition of Milgram.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Robinson Fresh sourcing net revenues increased 4.6 percent to $27.1 million from $25.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.

Robinson Fresh transportation net revenues increased 4.5 percent to $27.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $25.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to an increase in other transportation revenue, partially offset by a decrease in truckload net revenues. Robinson Fresh transportation net revenue margin decreased in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.

Robinson Fresh operating expenses increased 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $41.2 million from $38.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This was primarily due to an increase in salaries and variable compensation, partially offset by a decline in selling, general, and administrative expenses. 

All Other and Corporate includes our Managed Services segment, as well as Other Surface Transportation outside of North America and other miscellaneous revenues. It also includes any unallocated corporate expenses. Managed Services provides Transportation Management Service, or Managed TMS. Europe Surface Transportation provides services similar to NAST across the European continent. Net revenues for Managed Services and Other Surface Transportation are summarized as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Managed Services net revenues increased 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $18.3 million compared to $17.7 million the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was a result of new business. Other surface transportation net revenues increased 10.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $16.2 million compared to $14.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase is primarily the result of increased volumes, partially offset by margin compression in the surface transportation business in Europe.
