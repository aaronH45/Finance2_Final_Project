Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

Whirlpool Corporation (the “Company”) is making changes to its segment structure to align with the Company’s new leadership reporting structure announced internally in early December 2017. These changes include a realignment of its external segment reporting and a change to guided financial metrics. All of these changes are effective January 1, 2018.

Beginning with fiscal year 2018, the Company will report its Mexico business as a part of its Latin America segment, and will shift certain adjacent business from the North America segment to the Asia segment. Collectively, these businesses represented approximately $600 million of net sales and $50 million of operating profit in fiscal year 2016 and are currently reported as part of the North America segment.

In addition to the realignment of its external segment reporting, the Company will no longer report and guide segment operating profit. In alignment with the Company’s long-term metric, the Company will report and guide segment results as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), also effective January 1, 2018.

Relevant historical segment results will be provided under the new reporting structure and will include the EBIT metric. This information will be made available concurrent with the 2017 year-end earnings release in January 2018 on the Whirlpool Corporation investor website and as an exhibit to a current report on Form 8-K. Consolidated company historical results will remain unchanged.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
