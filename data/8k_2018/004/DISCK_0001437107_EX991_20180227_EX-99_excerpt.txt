DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS REPORTS FULL YEAR AND 

FOURTH QUARTER 2017 RESULTS

Silver Spring, Maryland – February 27, 2018: Discovery Communications, Inc. (“Discovery” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DISCA, DISCB, DISCK) today reported financial results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.

“2017 was an historic year for Discovery. We took significant steps to position ourselves for success in a changing industry, while driving growth from our traditional linear business and accelerating our investments in new growth areas like digital and mobile in an effort to reach superfans on every screen,” said David Zaslav, President and CEO, Discovery Communications. “Solid global advertising and distribution revenue growth helped us achieve our 2017 strategic and financial objectives. Additionally, we remain excited by the prospects for a combined Discovery and Scripps Networks.”

Full Year Results

Full year revenues of $6,873 million increased 6% compared to the prior year primarily due to 8% growth at International Networks and 5% growth at U.S. Networks, partially offset by a slight decline at Education and Other. Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization (“OIBDA”)(1) increased 5% to $2,531 million primarily due to 5% growth at U.S. Networks, 3% growth at International Networks, and a profit at Education and Other compared to a loss in the prior year, partially offset by higher corporate costs. Excluding currency effects and the impact of the The Enthusiast Network, Inc. ("TEN")(2) and Oprah Winfrey Network ("OWN")(3) transactions, total Company revenues and Adjusted OIBDA both grew 4%(4).

Full year net income/(loss) available to Discovery Communications, Inc. ("DCI Net Income") decreased to $(337) million as higher operating results and a positive after-tax impact from our solar investments were more than offset by a non-cash $1,321 million (or $2.29 per share) after-tax goodwill impairment charge(5), $201 million (or $0.35 per share) of after-tax Scripps Networks transaction-related costs(6) and currency-related transactional losses compared to gains in the prior year. DCI Net Income excluding the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, the goodwill impairment charge and Scripps Networks transaction-related costs ("Adjusted Net Income")(1)(7) was relatively consistent with the prior year, while Adjusted Net Income excluding currency effects increased 10%. Diluted earnings per share(8) decreased to $(0.59) due to lower DCI Net Income. Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share ("Adjusted EPS")(1)(7), which excludes the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, the goodwill impairment charge and Scripps Networks transaction-related costs, increased 5% and Adjusted EPS excluding currency effects increased 16%.

Free cash flow(1) increased 16% to $1,494 million for the full year 2017 from $1,292 million in the prior year as cash flow from operations increased 18% to $1,629 million from $1,380 million while capital expenditures increased to $135 million from $88 million. Cash flow from operations increased primarily due to improved operating results and lower cash taxes. Capital expenditures increased primarily due to higher technology and infrastructure investment. Free cash flow excluding the impact of currency effects and Scripps Networks transaction-related costs increased 25%. The goodwill impairment charge did not impact free cash flow. 

Fourth Quarter Results

Fourth quarter revenues of $1,864 million increased 11% compared to the prior year due to 13% growth at International Networks, 10% growth at U.S. Networks and slight growth at Education and Other. Adjusted OIBDA increased 10% to $636 million due to 9% growth at International Networks, 7% growth at U.S. Networks, and a profit at Education and Other compared to a loss in the prior year, partially offset by higher corporate costs. Excluding currency effects and the consolidation of TEN and OWN, fourth quarter total Company revenues and Adjusted OIBDA grew 5% and 9%, respectively.

Fourth quarter DCI Net Income decreased to $(1,144) million as improved operating results were more than offset by a non-cash $1,321 million after-tax goodwill impairment charge, $59 million (or $0.10 per share) of after-tax Scripps Networks transaction-related costs and currency-related transactional losses compared to gains in the prior year. Adjusted Net Income excluding currency effects decreased 4%. Diluted earnings per share decreased to $(1.99) due to lower DCI Net Income. Adjusted EPS decreased 16%, while Adjusted EPS excluding currency effects increased 1%.

Free cash flow decreased to $430 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as cash flow from operations decreased to $462 million while capital expenditures increased to $32 million. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations decreased primarily due to higher operating results and lower cash taxes more than offset by the timing of content spend and working capital. Free cash flow excluding the impact of currency effects and Scripps Networks transaction-related costs decreased 4%. The goodwill impairment charge did not impact free cash flow.

U.S. Networks

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Full Year Results

U.S. Networks’ revenues increased 5% to $3,434 million, primarily driven by 5% distribution growth and 3% advertising growth. Excluding the impact of the OWN and TEN transactions, distribution revenues would have increased 4%, primarily driven by higher affiliate rates partially offset by a decline in affiliate subscribers and, to a lesser extent, growth was driven by contributions from content deliveries under licensing agreements. Advertising revenues increased 2% excluding the impact of the Group Nine(1), OWN and TEN transactions, primarily due to higher pricing and the continued monetization of our GO platform, partially offset by lower linear delivery. 

Operating expenses increased 3% compared to the prior year, or 1% excluding the impact of the Group Nine, OWN and TEN transactions, primarily due to higher content amortization and research costs, partially offset by lower personnel and marketing costs. Adjusted OIBDA increased 5% to $2,026 million both on a reported basis and excluding the Group Nine, OWN and TEN transactions.

Fourth Quarter Results

U.S. Networks’ revenues for the fourth quarter increased 10% to $892 million, driven by 7% distribution growth,8% advertising growth and a significant increase in other revenues, primarily due to contributions from TEN. Excluding the impact of the OWN and TEN transactions, distribution revenue would have increased 3%, primarily driven by increases in affiliate fee rates, partially offset by a decline in affiliate subscribers. Consistent with third quarter trends, total portfolio subscribers declined 5% in the quarter, while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 3%. Advertising revenue increased 3% excluding the impact of the Group Nine, OWN and TEN transactions, primarily due to strength at TLC and ID linear networks and the continued monetization of our GO platform, partially offset by overall lower linear delivery.

Operating expenses increased 13%, or 1% excluding the impact of the Group Nine, OWN and TEN transactions, mainly due to increased content spend, partially offset by lower personnel and marketing costs. Adjusted OIBDA increased 7% to $478 million, or 4% excluding the impact of the Group Nine, OWN and TEN transactions.

Education and Other 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Full Year Results

Education and Other revenues decreased $16 million compared to the the prior year primarily due to the impact of the sale of the Raw and Betty production studios, partially offset by growth in Education revenues. Adjusted OIBDA increased $16 million primarily due to the reduction in expenses from the sale of the Raw and Betty production studios, partially offset by the lower revenues.

Fourth Quarter Results

Education and Other revenues for the fourth quarter increased by $4 million primarily due to increased International and digital textbook revenues at Education. Adjusted OIBDA increased $12 million primarily due to the reduction in expenses from the sale of the Raw and Betty production studios and higher revenues.

Corporate and Inter-Segment Eliminations

Adjusted OIBDA decreased $26 million and $6 million compared to the prior year for the full year 2017 and fourth quarter 2017, respectively, due to legal costs related to the Scripps Networks transaction, higher personnel costs and technology investments.

STOCK REPURCHASE 

Following the announcement of the pending acquisition of Scripps Networks (the "Scripps Networks Acquisition"), the Company suspended its share repurchase program and did not make any purchases of its shares during the fourth quarter. In 2017, the Company spent $603 million on share repurchases.

OTHER ITEMS

European Goodwill Impairment

In 2016, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test (comparison of fair value to carrying value), which it does every three years or whenever there is a trigger event or indicator of potential impairment, for each of its reporting units, which indicated limited headroom (the excess of fair value over carrying value) in the European reporting unit of 12%, but significant headroom in all other reporting units. 

Given the limited headroom in the European reporting unit, the Company closely monitored this unit's results during 2017 and again performed a quantitative impairment test of the European reporting unit as of November 30, 2017. When step 1 resulted in negative headroom, the Company went on to perform step 2 to quantify the amount of the impairment charge. Based on this analysis, in the fourth quarter of 2017, Discovery recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge totaling $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2017 for our European reporting unit. As of December 31, 2017, the carrying value of remaining goodwill assigned to the European reporting unit was $1.1 billion and the net assets of the reporting unit were approximately $2.7 billion. For additional details please refer to page 19 of this earnings press release and Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Discovery's Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2017.

Scripps Networks Acquisition Update

As of February 26, 2018, the Department of Justice has closed its investigation into Discovery’s proposed acquisition of Scripps Networks. We are awaiting completion of the review in Ireland, and we still expect the deal to close by the end of the first quarter of 2018.

OWN

On November 30, 2017, the Company acquired a controlling interest in OWN from Harpo. Discovery paid $70 million in cash to acquire the additional 24.5% stake in OWN, after taking into account net debt at the network. Harpo has the right to require the Company to purchase the entirety of its remaining non-controlling interest during 90-day windows beginning on July 1, 2018 and every two and half years thereafter through January 1, 2026. OWN is a pay-TV network and website that provides adult lifestyle content, which is focused on self-discovery, self-improvement and entertainment. 

Discovery Education

On February 26, 2018, the Company announced the planned sale of a controlling equity stake in its Education business in the first half of 2018 to Francisco Partners for cash of $120 million. The Company will retain an equity interest and license the Discovery Education brand to the business.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

In addition to the results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) provided in this release, the Company has presented Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted EPS and free cash flow. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, earnings per diluted share and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Please review the supplemental financial schedules beginning on page 15 for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures.

Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Excluding the Impact of Currency Effects

The Company evaluates the operating performance of its segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted OIBDA. Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income excluding: (i) mark-to-market share-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) restructuring and other charges, (iv) certain impairment charges, (v) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and (vi) certain inter-segment eliminations related to production studios. As of January 1, 2017, the Company no longer excludes amortization of deferred launch incentives in calculating total Adjusted OIBDA as this expense is not material. In addition, beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2017, Adjusted OIBDA also excludes material incremental third party transaction costs directly related to the Scripps Networks Acquisition and its planned integration. 

The Company uses Adjusted OIBDA to assess the operating results and performance of its segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to each segment. The Company believes Adjusted OIBDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. The Company excludes mark-to-market share-based compensation due to volatility, and excludes restructuring and other charges, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and Scripps Networks Acquisition and integration costs from the calculation of Adjusted OIBDA due to their impact on comparability between periods. The Company also excludes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. Refer to page 8 for our methodology for calculating growth rates excluding the impact of currency effects.

Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Net Income Excluding the Impact of Currency Effects and Adjusted EPS Excluding the Impact of Currency Effects

Adjusted Net Income is typically defined as earnings excluding the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Periodically, we exclude items impacting comparability as specified on page 13. Adjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income per diluted share. The Company believes Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are relevant to investors because this metric allows them to evaluate the performance of the Company's operations exclusive of the non-cash amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and meaningful one-time items that impact the comparability of results from period to period. Refer to page 8 for our methodology for calculating growth rates excluding the impact of currency effects.

Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Excluding the Impact of Currency Effects

The Company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less acquisitions of property and equipment. The Company uses free cash flow as it believes it is an important indicator for management and investors of the Company’s liquidity, including its ability to reduce debt, make strategic investments and return capital to stockholders. Refer to page 8 for our methodology for calculating growth rates excluding the impact of currency effects.

Methodology for Calculating Growth Rates Excluding the Impact of Currency Effects

The impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons of our results. For example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis ("ex-FX"), in addition to results reported in accordance with GAAP, provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-FX excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. The presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. 

The ex-FX change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. The ex-FX change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate (which is based on a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process) (the “2017 Baseline Rate”) and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2017 Baseline Rate. In addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-FX results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT DETAILS

The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on a qualitative basis annually as of November 30 and earlier if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not recover the carrying value of the asset. If the Company believes that as a result of its qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is not required. The Company performs a quantitative impairment test every three years, irrespective of the outcome of the Company's qualitative assessment. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed using a two-step process. The first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount (i.e., headroom), goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is required to be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.

The second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. In other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit’s identifiable net assets excluding goodwill is compared to the fair value of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Consistent with the Company's accounting policy, the Company performed a quantitative step 1 impairment test (comparison of fair value to carrying value) for each of its reporting units in 2016 which indicated limited headroom (the excess of fair value over carrying value) in the European reporting unit of 12%, all other reporting units had headroom in excess of 40%. Given the limited headroom in the European reporting unit, the Company closely monitored its results during 2017 and again performed a quantitative impairment test of the European reporting unit as of November 30, 2017, which indicated potential impairment (approximately $100 million or 3% deficit). The key factors resulting in the impairment include: 1) lower stock price multiples for peer media companies, 2) moderated revenue expectations based on continued declines in viewership and 3) expected increases in content investment to service existing customers and grow the Company's direct-to-consumer business. Given the results of the step 1 impairment test, the Company applied the hypothetical purchase price analysis required by the step 2 test and recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $1.3 billion as of November 30, 2017, for the European reporting unit. The impairment charge of $1.3 billion significantly exceeds the deficit of fair value to carrying value of approximately $100 million because of significant intangible assets that are not recognized on the Company's consolidated balance sheet (i.e., excluded from book carrying value) but are considered in the step 2 calculation on a fair value basis. The step 1 and step 2 tests and relevant assumptions are further discussed below. For the US Networks, Latin, Asia and Education reporting units, the Company performed a qualitative goodwill impairment review in 2017. No factors were identified indicating a need for a quantitative assessment. 

For the 2017 step 1 test, the carrying value of the European reporting unit of $4.0 billion, which includes $2.4 billion of goodwill, exceeded its fair value of $3.9 billion by 3%. In performing the step 1 test, the Company determined the fair value of its European reporting unit by using a combination of discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analyses and market-based valuation methodologies. The results of these valuation methodologies were weighted 75% towards the DCF and 25% towards the market-based approach, which is consistent with prior quantitative analyses. Significant judgments and assumptions used in the DCF and market-based model to assess the reporting unit's fair value include the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates of 2.5% (compared with 3% in 2016), a discount rate of 9.75% (compared with 10.5% in 2016), and our selection of guideline company earnings multiples of 7.5x (compared with 9.5x in 2016). The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis for the European reporting unit are based on the reporting unit's budget and long-term business plan, which reflect our expectations based upon recent operating performance. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions. Given the inherent uncertainty in determining the assumptions underlying a DCF analysis, actual results may differ from those used in the valuations.

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT DETAILS (continued)

The net assets assigned to the European reporting unit included corporate allocations. These assets and liabilities include corporate enterprise goodwill and intangible assets, allocated in prior periods based on the relative fair value of the European reporting unit at the time, and deferred taxes and content, allocated based on whether or not the jurisdiction gave rise to the deferred tax balance or is using the content asset.

In the second step of the impairment test, the Company theoretically assigned the European reporting unit's fair value to its individual assets and liabilities, including significant unrecognized intangible assets such as customer relationships and trade names, or liabilities, in a hypothetical purchase price allocation that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. Since the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill was less than the carrying value, the difference was recorded as an impairment charge. The fair value estimates incorporated in step 2 for the hypothetical intangible assets were based on the excess earnings income approach for customer relationships, the relief-from-royalty method for trademarks, and the greenfield approach for broadcast licenses. Key judgments made by management in step 2 of the impairment test included revenue growth rates, length of contract term, number of renewals, customer attrition rates, market-based royalty rates, and market based tax rates. The valuation of advertising relationships assumed an attrition rate of 10%, affiliate relationships assumed three contract renewals, each with a four year term, per customer and trade names assumed royalty rates ranging from 2% to 5%. Other assumptions used in these hypothetical calculations had a less significant impact on the concluded fair value or were subject to less significant estimation or judgment. None of these hypothetical calculations for unrecorded intangibles were recorded in the consolidated financial statements.

As of December 31, 2017, the carrying value of remaining goodwill assigned to the European reporting unit was $1.1 billion and the net assets of the reporting unit were approximately $2.7 billion, which results in significant headroom based on the estimated fair value of $3.9 billion.

The determination of fair value of the Company's DNI-Europe reporting unit represents a Level 3 fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. Changes in significant judgments and estimates could significantly impact the concluded fair value of the reporting unit or the valuation of intangible assets. Changes to assumptions that would decrease the fair value of the reporting unit would result in corresponding increases to the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. 

The goodwill impairment charge does not have an impact on the calculation of the Company's financial covenants under the Company's debt arrangements. 

As of November 30, 2016, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units. Due to the period elapsed since the last quantitative impairment test in 2013, the Company elected to proceed to the first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and, therefore, no impairment was recorded. The fair values of the reporting units were determined using DCF and market-based valuation models. Cash flows were determined based on Company estimates of future operating results and discounted using an internal rate of return based on an assessment of the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The market-based valuation models utilized multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Both the DCF and market-based models resulted in substantially similar fair values. 

As of November 30, 2015, the Company performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units, and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of those reporting units exceeded their carrying values.

20
