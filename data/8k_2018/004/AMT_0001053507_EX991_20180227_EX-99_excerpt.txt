AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Boston, Massachusetts – February 27, 2018: American Tower Corporation (NYSE: AMT) today reported financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. 

Jim Taiclet, American Tower’s Chief Executive Officer stated, “In 2007, American Tower initiated a long-term aspirational strategy which included a target of quadrupling both the size of our communications site portfolio and our financial performance over a ten-year time horizon. Based on our 2017 results, we have far exceeded both objectives, with over 150,000 sites versus a goal of 100,000 sites, and $6.72 per share of Consolidated AFFO versus a goal of $6.00 per share. Moreover, in 2017, we delivered growth of nearly 16% in Consolidated AFFO per Share, expanded our return on invested capital, increased our common stock dividend by more than 20%, and repurchased approximately $770 million in stock.

As we look forward to 2018, we expect strong organic tenant billings growth of over 6% in the U.S., driven by unlimited data plans, increasing mobile video consumption, announced spectrum build-outs in the 2.5 GHz and 600 MHz bands and the planned FirstNet deployment. We also expect consistent demand for tower space in Latin America, notably in Mexico and Brazil, as well as robust activity in our key markets in the EMEA region. Finally, we have incorporated into our 2018 outlook the expected impacts of the ongoing carrier consolidation process in India. We continue to have a high level of confidence that once the consolidation activity concludes, the Indian mobile industry will be positioned for major network investments to bring 4G service to the country’s 1.3 billion people, providing strong growth opportunities for our extensive portfolio in India.”

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS OVERVIEW

American Tower generated the following operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 (all comparative information is presented against the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively). The Company has converted its disclosure from thousands to millions and, as a result, certain necessary rounding adjustments have been made to prior year disclosed amounts in its financial statements.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Inclusive of impacts from Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn. For reconciliations of these impacts on key metrics, please see tables below.

(2)Reflects an impairment charge of approximately $209 million, primarily related to assets in India, partially offset by an income tax benefit associated with the impairment charge, both recorded in Q4 2017. The portion of this charge attributable to AMT common stockholders is approximately $127 million.

(3)Q4 2017 and FY 2017 cash capital expenditures include $8.8 million and $31.8 million, respectively, of payments on capital leases of property and equipment, which are presented in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows included herein under Repayments of notes payable, credit facilities, senior notes, term loan and capital leases.

Certain wireless carriers in India are in the process of merging their operations or exiting the marketplace. As anticipated, the Company’s operational and financial results during the fourth quarter of 2017 were impacted by churn driven by this carrier consolidation process. We are disclosing the additional financial metrics below to quantify the impacts of this churn, which we expect to occur at varying rates over the next several years, and to provide additional insight into the underlying long-term trends across the Company’s business excluding these impacts. The impact of Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn on net income is not provided, as the impact on all components of the net income measure cannot be reasonably calculated.

The net proceeds from these issuances were used to repay existing indebtedness under the Company’s senior unsecured revolving credit facilities.

FULL YEAR 2018 OUTLOOK

The following full year 2018 financial and operational estimates are based on a number of assumptions that management believes to be reasonable and reflect the Company’s expectations as of February 27, 2018. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates as a result of various factors, and the Company refers you to the cautionary language regarding “forward-looking” statements included in this press release when considering this information.

The Company’s outlook is based on the following average foreign currency exchange rates to 1.00 U.S. Dollar for February 27, 2018 through December 31, 2018: (a) 19.90 Argentinean Pesos; (b) 3.30 Brazilian Reais; (c) 615 Chilean Pesos; (d) 2,890 Colombian Pesos; (e) 0.81 Euros; (f) 4.55 Ghanaian Cedi; (g) 64.00 Indian Rupees; (h) 19.00 Mexican Pesos; (i) 385 Nigerian Naira; (j) 5,660 Paraguayan Guarani; (k) 3.25 Peruvian Soles; (l) 12.40 South African Rand; and (m) 3,670 Ugandan Shillings.

The Company’s outlook reflects estimated favorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to property revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated AFFO, of approximately $4 million, $6 million and $6 million, respectively, relative to the Company’s 2017 operating results. The impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on net income is not provided, as the impact on all components of the net income measure cannot be calculated without unreasonable effort. 

The Company’s outlook includes the impact of its pending Vodafone and Idea transactions in India, with an assumed closing date of May 1, 2018 for both transactions. 

Additionally, the Company’s full year 2018 outlook reflects estimated unfavorable impacts from Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn on property revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated AFFO of approximately $145 million, $85 million and $65 million, respectively, inclusive of an expected reduction in pass-through revenue of approximately $55 million. At this time, the Company expects the impacts of Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn to last for several years and anticipates that churn rates in India will return to lower levels once the consolidation process is complete. The Company is providing key outlook measures adjusted to quantify the impacts of Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn on such measures as it believes that these adjusted measures better reflect the long-term trajectory of its recurring 

3

business and provide investors with a more comprehensive analysis of the Company’s business. The impact of Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn on net income is not provided, as the impact on all components of the net income measure cannot be calculated without unreasonable effort.

Additional information pertaining to the impact of foreign currency, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) fluctuations and Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn on the Company’s outlook has been provided in the supplemental disclosure package available on the Company’s website.

Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures

In addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) provided throughout this press release, the Company has presented the following Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures: Gross Margin, Operating Profit, Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Nareit Funds From Operations (FFO) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO), AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated AFFO per Share, AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders per Share, Free Cash Flow, Net Debt, Net Leverage Ratio and Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn. In addition, the Company presents: Tenant Billings, Tenant Billings Growth, Organic Tenant Billings Growth and New Site Tenant Billings Growth.

These measures are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, they are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of the Company's core businesses and are commonly used across its industry peer group. As outlined in detail below, the Company believes that these measures can assist in comparing company performance on a consistent basis irrespective of depreciation and amortization or capital structure, while also providing valuable incremental insight into the underlying operating trends of its business.

Depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors, including historical cost basis, are involved. The Company's Non-GAAP and Defined Financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Revenue Components

In addition to reporting total revenue, the Company believes that providing transparency around the components of its revenue provides investors with insight into the indicators of the underlying demand for, and operating performance of, its real estate portfolio. Accordingly, the Company has provided disclosure of the following revenue components: (i) Tenant Billings, (ii) New Site Tenant Billings; (iii) Organic Tenant Billings; (iv) International pass-through revenue; (v) Straight-line revenue; (vi) Pre-paid amortization revenue; (vii) Foreign currency exchange impact; and (viii) Other revenue. 

Tenant Billings: The majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from non-cancellable, long-term tenant leases. Revenue from Tenant Billings reflects several key aspects of the Company’s real estate business: (i) “colocations/amendments” reflects new tenant leases for space on existing towers and amendments to existing leases to add additional tenant equipment; (ii) “escalations” reflects contractual increases in billing rates, which are typically tied to fixed percentages or a variable percentage based on a consumer price index; (iii) “cancellations” reflects the impact of tenant lease terminations or non-renewals or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced; and (iv) “new sites” reflects the impact of new property construction and acquisitions. 

New Site Tenant Billings: Day-one Tenant Billings associated with sites that have been built or acquired since the beginning of the prior-year period. Incremental colocations/amendments, escalations or cancellations that occur on these sites after the date of their addition to our portfolio are not included in New Site Tenant Billings. The Company believes providing New Site Tenant Billings enhances an investor’s ability to analyze our existing real estate portfolio growth as well as our development program growth, as the Company’s construction and acquisition activities can drive variability in growth rates from period to period. 

Organic Tenant Billings: Tenant Billings on sites that the Company has owned since the beginning of the prior-year period, as well as Tenant Billings activity on new sites that occurred after the date of their addition to the Company’s portfolio.

International pass-through revenue: A portion of the Company’s pass-through revenue is based on power and fuel expense reimbursements and therefore subject to fluctuations in fuel prices. As a result, revenue growth rates may fluctuate depending on the market price for fuel in any given period, which is not representative of the Company’s real estate business and its economic exposure to power and fuel costs. Furthermore, this expense reimbursement mitigates the economic impact associated with fluctuations in operating expenses, such as power and fuel costs and land rents in certain of the Company’s markets. As a result, the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pass-through revenue on certain revenue growth rates. 

Straight-line revenue: Under GAAP, the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract for certain of its tenant leases. Due to the Company’s significant base of non-cancellable, long-term tenant leases, this can result in significant fluctuations in growth rates upon tenant lease signings and renewals (typically increases), when amounts billed or received upfront upon these events are initially deferred. These signings and renewals are only a portion of the Company’s underlying business growth and can distort the underlying performance of our Tenant Billings Growth. As a result, the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of straight-line revenue on certain growth rates in revenue and select other measures.

Pre-paid amortization revenue: The Company recovers a portion of the costs it incurs for the redevelopment and development of its properties from its tenants. These upfront payments are then amortized over the initial term of the corresponding tenant lease. Given this amortization is not necessarily directly representative of underlying leasing activity on our real estate portfolio, (i.e.: does not have a renewal option or escalation as our tenant leases do) the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pre-paid amortization revenue on certain revenue growth rates to provide transparency into the underlying performance of our real estate business. 

Foreign currency exchange impact: The majority of the Company’s international revenue and operating expenses are denominated in each country’s local currency. As a result, foreign currency fluctuations may distort the underlying performance of our real estate business from 

6

period to period, depending on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar. The Company believes it is appropriate to quantify the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on its reported growth to provide transparency into the underlying performance of its real estate business. 

Other revenue: Other revenue represents revenue not captured by the above listed items and can include items such as tenant settlements and fiber solutions revenue.

Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measure Definitions

Tenant Billings Growth: The increase or decrease resulting from a comparison of Tenant Billings for a current period with Tenant Billings for the corresponding prior-year period, in each case adjusted for foreign currency exchange fluctuations. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth in recurring Tenant Billings and underlying demand for its real estate portfolio.

Organic Tenant Billings Growth: The portion of Tenant Billings Growth attributable to Organic Tenant Billings. The Company believes that organic growth is a useful measure of its ability to add tenancy and incremental revenue to its assets for the reported period, which enables investors and analysts to gain additional insight into the relative attractiveness, and therefore the value, of the Company’s property assets.

Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn: Tenant cancellations specifically attributable to short-term carrier consolidation in India. Includes impacts of carrier exits from the marketplace and carrier cancellations as a result of consolidation but excludes normal course churn. The Company believes that providing this additional metric enhances transparency and provides a better understanding of its recurring business without the impact of what it believes to be a transitory event.

New Site Tenant Billings Growth: The portion of Tenant Billings Growth attributable to New Site Tenant Billings. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth attributable to Tenant Billings from recently acquired or constructed properties.

Gross Margin: Revenues less operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations, depreciation, amortization and accretion, selling, general, administrative and development expense and other operating expenses. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site-level profitability of its assets. 

Operating Profit: Gross Margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site-level profitability of its assets while also taking into account the overhead expenses required to manage each of its operating segments. 

For segment reporting purposes, the Latin America property segment Operating Profit and Gross Margin also include interest income, TV Azteca, net. Operating Profit and Gross Margin are before interest income, interest expense, gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, other income (expense), net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest and income tax benefit (provision). 

Operating Profit Margin: The percentage that results from dividing Operating Profit by revenue. 

Adjusted EBITDA: Net income before income (loss) from equity method investments, income tax benefit (provision), other income (expense), gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, interest expense, interest income, other operating income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion and stock-based compensation expense. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the profitability of its operations while at the same time taking into account the central overhead expenses required to manage its global operations. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across our telecommunications real estate sector. 

Adjusted EBITDA Margin: The percentage that results from dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. 

Nareit Funds From Operations (FFO), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit), attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders: Net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by excluding the charges described above, particularly depreciation expenses, given the high initial, up-front capital intensity of the Company’s operating model. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across our telecommunications real estate sector.

Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO): Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders before (i) straight-line revenue and expense, (ii) stock-based compensation expense, (iii) the deferred portion of income tax, (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges, (vi) other income (expense), (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, (viii) other operating income (expense), and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by further adjusting the Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders metric to exclude the factors outlined above, which if unadjusted, may cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders growth from period to period that would not be representative of the 

7

underlying performance of our property assets in those periods. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across our telecommunications real estate sector.

Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders: Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders and the other line items included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. The Company believes that providing this additional metric enhances transparency, given a significantly larger minority interest component of its business as a result of the Company’s Viom transaction and European joint venture with PGGM, which both closed in 2016.

Consolidated AFFO per Share: Consolidated AFFO divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 

AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders per Share: AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.

Free Cash Flow: Cash provided by operating activities less total cash capital expenditures, including payments on capital leases of property and equipment. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as the basis for comparing our performance and coverage ratios with other companies in its industry, although this measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. 

Net Debt: Total long-term debt, including current portion, less cash and cash equivalents.

Net Leverage Ratio: Net Debt divided by the quarter’s annualized Adjusted EBITDA (the quarter’s Adjusted EBITDA multiplied by four). The Company believes that including this calculation is important for investors and analysts given it is a critical component underlying its credit agency ratings. 

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains “forward-looking statements” concerning our goals, beliefs, expectations, strategies, objectives, plans, future operating results and underlying assumptions, and other statements that are not necessarily based on historical facts. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our full year 2018 outlook and other targets, our expectations regarding Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn and factors that could affect our expectations, foreign currency exchange rates, our expectations for the closing of signed acquisitions and our expectations regarding the leasing demand for communications real estate.
