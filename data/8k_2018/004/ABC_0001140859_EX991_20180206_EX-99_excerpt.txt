AMERISOURCEBERGEN REPORTS

FISCAL 2018 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

Revenues of $40.5 Billion for the First Quarter, a 6.0 Percent Increase Year-Over-Year

First Quarter GAAP Diluted EPS of $3.90 and Adjusted Diluted EPS of $1.55 

Adjusted Diluted EPS Guidance Raised to $6.45 to $6.65 for Fiscal Year 2018, Primarily Driven by U.S. Tax Reform Benefit

VALLEY FORGE, PA, February 6, 2018 - AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE:ABC) today reported that in its fiscal year 2018 first quarter ended December 31, 2017, revenue increased 6.0 percent to $40.5 billion. On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $3.90 for the December quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $1.11 in the prior year quarter. GAAP EPS for the December quarter of fiscal 2018 was favorably impacted by new U.S. tax reform legislation. Adjusted diluted EPS, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes items described below, increased 14.0 percent to $1.55 in the fiscal first quarter and also included a benefit from the Company's expected full fiscal year effective tax rate. 

AmerisourceBergen is updating its outlook for fiscal year 2018. The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, as discussed below in Fiscal Year 2018 Expectations. Adjusted diluted EPS guidance has been raised from the previous expectation of $5.90 to $6.15 to a range of $6.45 to $6.65, reflecting growth of 10 percent to 13 percent versus last fiscal year. The adjusted diluted EPS benefit from U.S. tax reform is expected to be approximately $0.60 in fiscal 2018, offset by a lower than expected contribution from PharMEDium.

“In the first quarter of the fiscal year, we saw further market, pricing and competitive stability. AmerisourceBergen continued to lead the market in specialty product distribution and pharmaceutical services and our core pharmaceutical distribution businesses executed extremely well - growing volumes with key customers and segments - and continued to effectively manage operating expenses. We are proud of the work our associates have done and pleased with this strong start for the fiscal year,” said Steven H. Collis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of AmerisourceBergen. 

“Our updated outlook for fiscal 2018 reflects this performance and the expected benefit of U.S. tax reform, partially offset by a lower than expected contribution from PharMEDium. We remain confident in PharMEDium's ability to return to its long-term growth trajectory, and committed to providing our customers with the highest quality products and services as we continue to invest in AmerisourceBergen,” Mr. Collis continued. “AmerisourceBergen’s scale, proven ability to execute, strategic evolution and continued investment position the Company for long-term growth as we innovate and deliver value to our shareholders. We are living our corporate purpose and are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.”

Segment Discussion

The Company's operations are comprised of the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment and other operating segments that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and, therefore, have been included in Other for the purpose of reportable segment presentation. Other consists of operating segments that focus on global 

commercialization services and animal health and includes AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS), World Courier and MWI Animal Health (MWI).

Pharmaceutical Distribution Services Segment

Pharmaceutical Distribution Services revenue was $38.9 billion, an increase of 5.8 percent compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. Segment operating income of $388.2 million in the December quarter of fiscal 2018 was up 2.4 percent compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The segment was impacted by reduced production at PharMEDium's Memphis 503B outsourcing facility, where, following inspections by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, operations were voluntarily suspended in December so that the company could execute certain remedial measures.

Other

Revenue in Other was $1.5 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 11.6 percent compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year as all three business units contributed to revenue growth in the quarter. Operating income in Other decreased 6.4 percent to $100.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by performance at ABCS, specifically the Lash Group, and MWI and was partially offset by the contribution from World Courier.

D. Smith and PharMEDium, or the inability to capture all of the anticipated synergies related thereto or to capture the anticipated synergies within the expected time period; the effects of disruption from the transactions on the respective businesses of the Company and H. D. Smith and the fact that the transactions may make it more difficult to establish or maintain relationships with employees, suppliers, customers and other business partners; the disruption of the Company’s cash flow and ability to return value to its stockholders in accordance with its past practices; interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and other economic, business, competitive, legal, tax, regulatory and/or operational factors affecting the Company’s business generally.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: (i) adjusted gross profit; (ii) adjusted operating expenses; (iii) adjusted operating income; (iv) adjusted interest expense, net; (v) adjusted net income; (vi) adjusted tax rate; and (vii) adjusted diluted earnings per share. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These supplemental measures may vary from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies.

The non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance, to perform financial planning, and to determine incentive compensation. Therefore, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors. The presented non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that management does not believe reflect the Company’s core operating performance as such items are outside the control of the Company or due to their inherent unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash nature. We have included the following non-GAAP earnings-related financial measures in this release:

•Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit margin: Adjusted gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the gain from antitrust litigation settlements and LIFO expense because the Company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items. Adjusted gross profit margin is the ratio of adjusted gross profit to total revenue. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as a supplemental measure of the Company’s ongoing operating performance. The gain from antitrust litigation settlements relates to the settlement of class action lawsuits that have been filed against brand pharmaceutical manufacturers alleging that the manufacturer, by itself or in concert with others, took improper actions to delay or prevent generic drugs from entering the market. LIFO expense is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences.

•Adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating expense margin: Adjusted operating expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes acquisition-related intangibles amortization and employee severance, litigation, and other. Adjusted operating expense margin is the ratio of adjusted operating expenses to total revenue. The acquisition-related intangibles amortization is excluded because it is a non-cash item and does not reflect the operating performance of the acquired companies. We exclude employee severance amounts that relate to non-recurring organizational restructuring. We exclude the amount of litigation settlements and other expenses that are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature because we believe these exclusions facilitate the analysis of our ongoing operational performance. 

•Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin: Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the same items that are described above and excluded from adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expenses. Adjusted operating income margin is the ratio of adjusted operating income to total revenue. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as a supplemental way to evaluate the Company’s performance because the adjustments are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature.

•Adjusted interest expense, net: Adjusted interest expense is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the interest expense on our $600 million of 1.15% senior notes that were repaid in May 2017 (the “2017 Notes”). The 2017 Notes were issued to fund a special $650 million share repurchase program under which we purchased shares to reduce the dilution related to the warrants that we issued in March 2013 to wholly-owned subsidiaries of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s ongoing interest expense, net.

•Adjusted tax rate: Adjusted tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure that is determined by dividing adjusted income tax expense/benefit by adjusted income before income taxes. 

•Adjusted net income: Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the same items that are described above and excluded from adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, and adjusted interest expense, net. In addition, the loss on the early retirement of debt and the one-time impact of U.S. tax reform ("Tax Reform") are excluded from adjusted net income. Tax Reform includes a benefit from applying a lower U.S. federal income tax rate to the Company's net deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017, offset in part by a one-time transition tax on historical foreign earnings and profits through December 31, 2017. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as a supplemental way to evaluate the Company's performance because the adjustments are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature.

•Adjusted diluted earnings per share: Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the per share impact of adjustments including gain from antitrust litigation settlements; LIFO expense; acquisition-related intangibles amortization; employee severance, litigation, and other; the interest expense incurred in connection with the 2017 Notes; and the loss on early retirement of debt; in each case net of the tax effect calculated using the applicable effective tax rate for those items. In addition, the per share impact of Tax Reform is excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the per share impact of the items that are outside the control of the Company or that we consider to not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash nature. 

In addition, the Company has provided non-GAAP fiscal year 2018 guidance for diluted earnings per share, operating expense, operating income, and effective income tax rate that excludes the same or similar items as those that are excluded from the historical non-GAAP financial measures, as well as significant items that are outside the control of the Company or inherently unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature. In addition, it has provided 2018 free cash flow guidance. For fiscal year 2018, we have defined the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding other significant unpredictable or non-recurring cash payments or receipts relating to legal settlements, minus capital expenditures. The Company does not provide forward looking guidance on a GAAP basis for such metrics because certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated. For example, LIFO expense is largely dependent upon the future inflation or deflation of brand and generic pharmaceuticals, which is out of the Company’s control, and acquisition-related intangibles amortization depends on the timing and amount of future acquisitions, which cannot be reasonably estimated. Similarly, the timing and amount of litigation settlements is unpredictable and non-recurring.
