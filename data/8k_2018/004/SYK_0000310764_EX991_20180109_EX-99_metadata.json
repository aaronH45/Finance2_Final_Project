        "Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of our expected net earnings per diluted share to expected adjusted net earnings per diluted share without unreasonable efforts due to the inherent difficulty in predicting or estimating the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on our GAAP earnings. Such impact potentially could be significant."
