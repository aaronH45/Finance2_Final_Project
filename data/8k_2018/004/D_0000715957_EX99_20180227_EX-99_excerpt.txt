2017 Earnings (Twelve months ended December 31, 2017)  

The $235 million pre-tax net effect of the adjustments included in 2017 reported earnings, but excluded from operating earnings, is primarily related to the following items:  

   •   $158 million of impairment charges associated with our equity method investments in wind-powered generation facilities.  

   •   $72 million of transaction and transition costs, primarily associated with the Dominion Energy Questar combination.

The 2017 Tax Reform Act reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Dominion Energy recognized $851 million of tax benefits resulting from the re-measurement of deferred income taxes to the new corporate income tax rate.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1)  Adjustments to reported earnings are reflected in the following table:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ** Federal tax reform, enacted in December 2017, reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective 1/1/2018. Deferred taxes are required to be measured at the enacted rate in effect when they are expected to reverse. As a result, deferred taxes were re-measured to the 21% rate. For regulated entities, where the reduction in deferred taxes is expected to be recovered or refunded in future rates, the adjustment was recorded to a regulatory asset or liability instead of income tax expense.  

 2)  YTD EPS may not equal sum of quarters due to share count differences
