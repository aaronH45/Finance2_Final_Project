 2018 Outlook  

 On January 1, 2018, TSYS adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” using the modified retrospective transition method. The 2018 guidance is below and includes the expected impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard, the expected impact of the acquisition of Cayan, the expected impact of the new tax law (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) and the expected effective date of October 2018 of the prepaid rules by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

   (1)    The estimated impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on TSYS’ 2018 Outlook is as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The most significant impact of adopting ASC 606 in 2018 is primarily the result of gross versus net presentation of interchange and payment network fees. In 2018, these fees collected on behalf of the payment networks and card issuers will be presented “net” of the amounts paid to them, as opposed to the “gross” presentation for certain of these fees in 2017.  

 Conference Call  

 TSYS will host its quarterly conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, January 23. The conference call can be accessed via simultaneous Internet broadcast on the “Investor Relations” section of TSYS’ website at investors.tsys.com where an accompanying slide presentation will also be available. The replay will be archived for 12 months and will be available approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the call.

Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “should,” “plan,” “potential,” “will,” “could,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding the expectation that the momentum of 2017 will carry over into 2018, the projected strong organic revenue growth and TSYS’ earnings guidance for 2018 total revenues, net revenue, diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS, and the assumptions underlying such statements, including with respect to TSYS’ earnings guidance for 2018 set forth under the caption “2018 Outlook” above. These statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of TSYS’ management, are based on management’s assumptions and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. A number of important factors could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements in this press release. Many of these factors are beyond TSYS’ ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to, the material breach of security of any of TSYS’ systems; TSYS’ ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve the anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits of the acquisitions, particularly the recently completed Cayan acquisition; the effect of current domestic and worldwide economic conditions; risks associated with foreign operations, including adverse developments with respect to foreign currency exchange rates, and in particular with respect to the current environment, adverse developments with respect to foreign currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union (Brexit); expenses incurred associated with the signing of a significant client; TSYS does not convert clients’ portfolios as scheduled; the deconversion of a significant client; changes occur in laws, rules, regulations, credit card association rules, prepaid industry rules or other industry standards affecting TSYS and our clients that may result in costly new compliance burdens on TSYS and our clients and lead to a decrease in the

 Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

 Non-GAAP Measures  

 The schedules below provide a reconciliation of revenues and operating results on a constant currency basis to reported revenues and operating income. This non-GAAP measure presents fourth quarter and year-to-date 2017 financial results using the previous year’s foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, TSYS’ total year-to-date revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 grew 18.5% as compared to a reported GAAP increase of 18.2%.  

 The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS.  

 The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA.  

 The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities and capital expenditures to free cash flow.   

 The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of 2018 guidance of total revenues to net revenue and diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS.   

 The tax rate used in the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter and year is equal to an estimate of our annual effective tax rate on GAAP income. This effective rate is estimated annually and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events or trends that materially impact the effective tax rate including, but not limited to, significant changes resulting from tax legislation, material changes in the mix of revenues and expenses by entity and other significant events.  

 TSYS believes that non-GAAP financial measures are important to enable investors to understand and evaluate its ongoing operating results. Accordingly, TSYS includes non-GAAP financial measures when reporting its financial results to shareholders and potential investors in order to provide them with an additional tool to evaluate TSYS’ ongoing business operations. TSYS believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are representative of comparative financial performance that reflects the economic substance of TSYS’ current and ongoing business operations.  

 Although non-GAAP financial measures are often used to measure TSYS’ operating results and assess its financial performance, they are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation.  

 TSYS believes that its provision of non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with important key financial performance indicators that are utilized by management to assess TSYS’ operating results, evaluate the business and make operational decisions on a prospective, going-forward basis. Hence, management provides disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures to give shareholders and potential investors an opportunity to see TSYS as viewed by management, to assess TSYS with some of the same tools that management utilizes internally and to be able to compare such information with prior periods. TSYS believes that inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional information to help them better understand its financial statements just as management utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures to better understand the business, manage budgets and allocate resources.

 **** On December 22,2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act). Based on its preliminary analysis of the Tax Act, including the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate, TSYS estimates that it will receive an additional, non-recurring income tax benefit of approximately $135.9 million due to the reduction of certain deferred tax liabilities and the repatriation of foreign earnings as a result of the Tax Act.

   (1)    The estimated impact of the adoption of ASC 606 on TSYS’ 2018 Outlook is as follows: Total revenues ($1,600) to ($1,575), Net revenue ($62) to ($69), Diluted EPS and Adjusted diluted EPS of ($0.04) to ($0.03). The most significant impact of adopting ASC 606 in 2018 is primarily the result of gross versus net presentation of interchange and payment network fees. In 2018, these fees collected on behalf of the payment networks and card issuers will be presented “net” of the amounts paid to them, as opposed to the “gross” presentation for certain of these fees in 2017.
