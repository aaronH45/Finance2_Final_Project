 ITEM 8.01.  OTHER EVENTS     

Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (the “Company”) is providing an update regarding the expected impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on its financial results. 

  ·   The Company estimates that the impact of tax reform will result in additional net tax expense of approximately $3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily related to taxes on unremitted offshore earnings. This charge will impact the Company’s previously provided 2017 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) tax rate and earnings per share guidance but is not expected to have an impact on non-GAAP guidance.     

  ·   The Company is still evaluating all the provisions of the tax reform legislation and currently estimates that the net impact of tax reform on the non-GAAP tax rate as roughly neutral in 2018; this will be updated when the Company provides full year guidance for 2018 on its fourth quarter/full-year 2017 earnings call on February 5, 2018.
