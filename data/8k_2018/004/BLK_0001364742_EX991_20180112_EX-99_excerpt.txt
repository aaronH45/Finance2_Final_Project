New York, January 12, 2018 — BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) today reported financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017. 

“BlackRock’s record 2017 results reflect the long-term investments we’ve consistently made in our business to better serve clients,” commented Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock. “$367 billion of total net inflows for the year were the strongest flows in BlackRock’s history, and included $103 billion in the fourth quarter.  

“Full year net inflows represented 7% organic asset growth and were positive across client types, asset classes, major regions and investment styles. Investors are increasingly seeking comprehensive solutions, and BlackRock’s differentiated ability to offer scaled investment strategies, industry leading risk management and portfolio construction technology and thought leadership is driving deeper client partnerships than ever before. And we continue to expand the global reach of our integrated platform to investors in high growth geographies like China, where earlier this month we obtained our private fund management registration to manufacture and distribute onshore investment products. 

-1- 

“iShares ETFs generated $245 billion of full year net inflows, as an increasingly diverse set of institutional and retail clients are using ETFs for asset allocation and alpha generation. Investors are using both equity and fixed income ETFs in their portfolios for Core and precision exposures and as financial instruments. Investments made in iShares ETFs drove expanded market share in 2017 and enabled us to once again capture the #1 share of industry ETF flows globally, in the United States and Europe, and in both equity and fixed income products.  

“In alpha-seeking strategies, we are leveraging the powerful combination of human investment expertise and sophisticated data analytics. Performance across our alpha-seeking strategies remains strong and drove $24 billion of net inflows in 2017. 

“Technology and risk management revenue, powered by Aladdin®, increased 14% for the full year, and demand remains strong across our full range of capabilities. In 2017, we expanded our technology reach, scaling our distribution capabilities through Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, Cachematrix, iCapital and Scalable Capital. We continue to invest in technology and data to generate improved alpha, better serve our clients and more efficiently run our business. 

“Throughout BlackRock’s 30-year history, we have been driven by a fiduciary commitment to our clients, a culture of innovation, a passion for performance and a workplace that embraces diversity and inclusion. We are fortunate to have dedicated employees who share our vision of creating better financial futures for clients. We enter 2018 well positioned to continue investing for future growth, developing our talent and delivering differentiated value for clients and shareholders alike.” 

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 

BlackRock’s Board of Directors approved a 15% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $2.88 per share, payable March 22, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 7, 2018.

▪  

Retail long-term net inflows of $11.4 billion reflected net inflows of $7.4 billion in the United States and $4.0 billion internationally. Fixed income net inflows of $8.0 billion were diversified across our top-performing active platform, led by net inflows into unconstrained, short duration and municipals categories. Multi-asset net inflows of $2.0 billion were largely due to inflows into the Multi-asset Income fund family. Equity net inflows of $1.1 billion were paced by flows into international equities.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (unaudited)  

BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.  

Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.  

-12- 

Computations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:  

(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors.  

▪  

Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. For the year ended December 31, 2016, a restructuring charge comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards has been excluded to provide an analysis of BlackRock’s ongoing operations and to ensure comparability among periods presented.  

▪  

Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes such costs represent a benchmark for the amount of revenue passed through to external parties who distribute the Company’s products. In addition, management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue the Company earns. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenue.   

(2) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.  

See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation and the restructuring charge.  

For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustment related to the restructuring charge and PNC LTIP funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. The noncash deferred tax revaluation benefit of $1,758 million and the other income tax matters noncash benefit of $3 million were primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill. Amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. A deemed repatriation tax expense of $477 million has been excluded from the as adjusted results due to the one-time nature and to ensure comparability among periods presented.  

Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 

(3) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
