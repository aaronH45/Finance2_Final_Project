Financial Results

For the full year 2017, Federal Realty reported net income available for common shareholders of $287.5 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.97. This compares to net income available for common shareholders of $249.4 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.50 for the full year 2016. Net income available for common shareholders was $48.6 million and earnings per diluted share was $0.67 for the fourth quarter 2017 versus $57.9 million and $0.80, respectively, for the fourth quarter 2016.

For the full year 2017, Federal Realty generated funds from operations available for common shareholders (FFO) of $420.0 million, or $5.74 per diluted share. Excluding the $12.3 million early extinguishment of debt charge in the fourth quarter 2017, FFO per diluted share for the full year 2017 would have been $5.91. This compares to FFO of $406.4 million, or $5.65 per diluted share, for the full year 2016. For the fourth quarter 2017, FFO was $95.5 million, or $1.30 per diluted share ($1.47 if the early extinguishment of debt charge was excluded), compared to $104.9 million, or $1.45 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2016.

FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental earnings measure which the Trust considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is attached to this press release.

Portfolio Results

For the year 2017, same-center property operating income increased 3.4% when including properties that are being redeveloped and 0.7% when excluding those properties. In fourth quarter 2017, same-center property operating income increased 2.6% when including properties that are being redeveloped and 1.0% when excluding those properties. As anticipated, the Trust’s proactive releasing initiatives throughout the portfolio negatively impacted the year end and quarterly results.

The overall portfolio was 95.3% leased as of December 31, 2017, compared to 94.4% on December 31, 2016. Federal Realty’s same center portfolio was 96.3% leased on December 31, 2017, compared to 95.9% on December 31, 2016.

For the year 2017, Federal Realty signed 406 leases for 1.8 million square feet of retail space. On a comparable basis (i.e., spaces for which there was a former tenant), Federal Realty leased 1.6 million square feet at an average cash-basis contractual rent increase (i.e., excluding the impact of straight-line rents) of 13%. The average contractual rent on this comparable space for the first year of the new leases is $38.31 per square foot compared to the average contractual rent of $33.79 per square foot for the last year of the prior leases. The previous average contractual rent was calculated by including both the minimum rent and any percentage rent actually paid during the last year of the lease term for the re-leased space. On a GAAP basis (i.e., including the impact of straight-line rents), rent increases for comparable retail space averaged 26% for the year ended 2017.

During fourth quarter 2017, Federal Realty signed 91 leases for 344,768 square feet of retail space. On a comparable space basis, Federal Realty leased 300,511 square feet at an average cash basis contractual rent increase of 15% and 27% on a GAAP basis. The average contractual rent on this comparable space for the first year of the new leases is$34.75 per square foot compared to the average contractual rent of $30.19 per square foot for the last year of the prior leases.

Notes:

(1)There is no guarantee that the Trust will ultimately complete any or all of these opportunities, that the Projected Return on Investment (ROI) or Projected Costs will be the amounts shown or that stabilization will occur as anticipated. The projected ROI and Projected Cost are management's best estimate based on current information and may change over time. 

(2)Projected ROI for redevelopment projects generally reflects only the deal specific cash, unleveraged incremental Property Operating Income (POI) generated by the redevelopment and is calculated as Incremental POI divided by incremental cost. Incremental POI is the POI generated by the redevelopment after deducting rent being paid or management's estimate of rent to be paid for the redevelopment space and any other space taken out of service to accommodate the redevelopment. Projected ROI for redevelopment projects does NOT include peripheral impacts, such as the impact on future lease rollovers at the property or the impact on the long-term value of the property.  

(3)Stabilization is generally the year in which 95% physical occupancy of the redeveloped space is achieved. Economic stabilization may occur at a later point in time. 

(4)All subtotals and totals reflect cost weighted-average ROIs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Notes:

(1)Anticipated opening dates, total cost, projected return on investment (ROI), and projected POI percentages are subject to adjustment as a result of factors inherent in the development process, some of which may not be under the direct control of the Company. Refer to the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for other risk factors.

(2)Percentage figures reflect (i) the projected POI (herein defined) for the stated year divided by (ii) the current projected annual stabilized POI for the Property. These percentages are projections only and we cannot give any assurances that these amounts will actually be achieved.

(3)Projected ROI for development projects reflects the unleveraged Property Operating Income (POI) generated by the development and is calculated as POI divided by cost.

(4)Projected costs for Assembly Row and Pike & Rose include an allocation of infrastructure costs for the entire project.

(5)Costs are net of expected reimbursement by third parties and land sale proceeds. Phase II total costs include our share of the costs in the hotel.

(6)Condominiums shown at cost; the projected ROI for Phase II does not assume any incremental profit on the sale of condominium units; for return calculation purposes, condominiums are assumed to be sold at cost.

Glossary of Terms

Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that means net income or loss plus depreciation and amortization, net interest expense, income taxes, gain or loss on sale of real estate, and impairments of real estate, if any. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because it approximates a key performance measure in our debt covenants, but it should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) (Benefit) provision for income tax for both the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to condominium sales gains.

Funds From Operations (FFO): FFO is a supplemental measure of real estate companies' operating performances. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as follows: net income, computed in accordance with GAAP plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on sale of real estate, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate. NAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure of performance and liquidity of an equity REIT in order to recognize that the value of income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. However, FFO does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income); should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance; and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to pay dividends. We consider FFO a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. 

Property Operating Income: Rental income, other property income and mortgage interest income, less rental expenses and real estate taxes.

Overall Portfolio: Includes all operating properties owned in reporting period.

Same Center: Information provided on a same center basis is provided for only those properties that were owned, operated, and consolidated for the entirety of both periods being compared, excludes properties that were redeveloped, expanded or under development and properties purchased or sold at any time during the periods being compared. Same center growth statistics are calculated on a GAAP basis. 

Tenant Improvements and Incentives: Represents not only the total dollars committed for the improvement (fit-out) of a space as it relates to a specific lease and, except for redevelopments, may also include base building costs (i.e. expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable. Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements.
