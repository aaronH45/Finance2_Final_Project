 Item 8.01 Other Events.  

On February 28, 2018, Dominion Energy, Inc. (the Company) entered into six separate Sales Agency Agreements with each of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. (collectively the “Sales Agents”) pursuant to which the Sales Agents will act, each in their individual capacity as a sales agent, as the Company’s sales agents with respect to offerings from time to time of up to $1,000,000,000 aggregate offering amount of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares”). These agreements replace sales agency agreements entered into by the Company on June 30, 2017 with certain of the Sales Agents in connection with the Company’s prior “at the market” offering program referred to below (the 2017 ATM Program). Sales of the Shares, if any, will be made by means of (i) privately negotiated transactions, or (ii) by any other method or payment permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market” offering as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange or sales made to or through a market maker or through an electronic communications network.  

This “at the market” offering program replaces the 2017 ATM Program, which terminated in accordance with its terms in January 2018 upon the sale of the entire $500,000,000 aggregate offering amount of the Company’s common stock available under such program.  

Any Shares sold under the new program will be issued pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-219088) filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 30, 2017 (the “Registration Statement”), which was automatically effective upon filing.  

A form of the Sales Agency Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1.2 to the Registration Statement.
