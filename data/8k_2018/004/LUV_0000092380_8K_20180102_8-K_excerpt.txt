Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

Southwest Airlines Co. (the "Company") is providing estimated financial and operational impacts related to tax reform legislation and certain other fourth quarter 2017 items and actions.

•The Company expects to record approximately $105 million in expenses during fourth quarter 2017 related to the following items that were not included in previous guidance for fourth quarter 2017:

◦The approval in December 2017 by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of a $1,000 cash bonus to each eligible Employee as of December 31, 2017, in celebration of tax reform legislation. The Company estimates that this bonus, and related cash bonus payroll taxes, will result in approximately $70 million in incremental salaries, wages, and benefits expense in fourth quarter 2017.

◦A charitable contribution of $5 million.

◦Approximately $30 million related to a litigation settlement, as well as unplanned costs, primarily in salaries, wages, and benefits, related to ongoing Labor negotiations.

•These expenses are estimated to add approximately 3.5 points to the Company’s previous guidance for its fourth quarter 2017 year-over-year trend in operating expenses per available seat mile, excluding fuel, profitsharing, and special items.

•The Company expects to record a credit, or reduction, to income tax expense in fourth quarter 2017 in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion due to tax reform legislation as a result of the difference between rates in effect when income tax expense was accrued, and the rates expected to be in effect when the income taxes will in fact be paid. This estimated impact is a non-cash item for fourth quarter 2017, and is expected to be treated as a special item.

•Based on the Company’s fuel derivative contracts and market prices as of December 29, 2017, the Company now expects its fourth quarter 2017 economic fuel costs to be in the $2.10 to $2.15 per gallon range1, including taxes.

•During fourth quarter 2017, the Company returned $350 million to its Shareholders through the repurchase of common stock. The Company repurchased $250 million in common stock pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program launched during fourth quarter and received approximately 3.32 million shares, representing an estimated 75 percent of the shares expected to be repurchased under that ASR program. Additionally, the Company repurchased approximately 1.63 million shares through $100 million in open market transactions. During fourth quarter 2017, the Company also received approximately 1.21 million shares, which remained pursuant to a $300 million third quarter 2017 ASR program. The Company has $1.35 billion remaining under its May 2017 share repurchase authorization.

•The Company revised its future firm order delivery schedule with Boeing during fourth quarter 2017 to support future growth opportunities and fleet modernization at favorable economics. The Company exercised 40 737 MAX 8 options for 15 firm orders in 2019 and 25 firm orders in 2020. The Company also deferred 23 737 MAX 7 firm orders from 2019 through 2021 to 12 firm orders in 2023 and 11 firm orders in 2024. The Company also accelerated 23 737 MAX 8 firm orders from 2023 through 2024 to an additional 21 firm orders in 2021 and 2 firm orders in 2022. Additional information regarding the Company’s aircraft delivery schedule is below. The Company’s 2018 available seat mile growth plans remain unchanged. The Company's capital commitments associated with firm orders for 2018 are now expected to be less than $1 billion due to the Company’s revised aircraft delivery schedule. For 2019 through 2022, the Company's capital commitments associated with firm orders are expected to be approximately $1 billion per year, on average.

737 Delivery Schedule

As of December 31, 2017 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) The Company has flexibility to substitute 737-7 in lieu of 737-8 aircraft beginning in 2019.

The information furnished in this Item 2.02 shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

1Economic fuel cost projections do not reflect the potential impact of special items because the Company cannot reliably predict or estimate the hedge accounting impact associated with the volatility of the energy markets or the impact to its financial statements in future periods. Accordingly, the Company believes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the equivalent GAAP financial measures for projected results is not meaningful or available without unreasonable effort.
