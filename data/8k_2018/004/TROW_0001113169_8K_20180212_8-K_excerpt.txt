SECTION 5 - CORPORATE GOVERANCE AND MANAGEMENT.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

(b) On February 14, 2018, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (the “Company”) announced that Edward C. Bernard, Vice Chairman, will retire from the Company on December 31, 2018, after 30 years of service. Mr. Bernard will stand for re-election to a final one-year term on the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) at the Company’s upcoming April 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If re-elected, Mr. Bernard will not stand for re-election to the Board during the April 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

(e) The Annual Incentive Compensation Pool for our senior executive officers previously in place (the “Prior Plan”) terminated, by its terms, as a result of the repeal of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, by the U.S. tax reform bill originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In response, the Executive Compensation and Management Development Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board approved a new 2018 Annual Incentive Compensation Pool (the “2018 AICP”) on February 12, 2018. The 2018 AICP is substantially the same as the Prior Plan and was adopted by the Committee to provide continuity in 2018 of incentive compensation arrangements for the officers.

Similar to the Prior Plan, the 2018 AICP establishes a cash incentive pool (the “Incentive Pool”) equal to a percentage of the Company’s adjusted earnings, as defined in the 2018 AICP. For each fiscal year, the Committee will determine the officers who will participate in the 2018 AICP and the maximum percentage of the Incentive Pool each executive officer has a right to receive for that fiscal year. At the end of the fiscal year, the Committee will determine the total Incentive Pool available for awards and the actual award each officer will receive. For 2018, the Committee approved the named executive officers that would participate in the 2018 AICP and the maximum percentage of the Incentive Pool each officer would be eligible to receive as follows:

Consistent with prior years, the Committee expects that the actual awards to the officers will be less than the maximum amounts allocated to each officer.

A copy of the 2018 AICP is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
