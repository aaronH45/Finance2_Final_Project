PHILADELPHIA, February 12, 2018 - FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. For the year, FMC reported revenue of approximately $2.9 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2016. On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of $536 million, or $3.99 per diluted share. Full year adjusted earnings were $2.71 per diluted share, an increase of 41 percent compared to the prior year.

For the fourth quarter, FMC reported revenue of $980 million, an increase of 42 percent year-over-year. Excluding revenue related to FMC’s recent acquisition, underlying growth was 14 percent. On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of $3.94 per diluted share in the fourth quarter, or $530 million, which compares to the GAAP earnings of $0.12 per diluted share, or $16 million, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The GAAP figure includes a $727 million gain, net of tax, from the November 2017 sale of FMC Health and Nutrition, partially offset by a provisional income tax charge of $316 million related to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.10, 67 percent higher than the prior year quarter. 

Pierre Brondeau, FMC president, CEO and chairman said: “FMC delivered another very strong quarter. In Ag Solutions, our legacy business posted 9 percent revenue growth versus the same quarter last year, and our integration of the DuPont crop protection business is proceeding very well. Our lithium hydroxide expansion in China led to a doubling of Lithium segment earnings year-over-year, and we are

moving forward with plans to double our lithium carbonate capacity in Argentina by 2022.”

FMC Agricultural Solutions

FMC Agricultural Solutions reported fourth quarter revenue of $866 million, an increase of 40 percent year-over-year. FMC’s legacy Agricultural Solutions grew 9 percent in the quarter, driven by double-digit revenue growth in North America, Asia and Europe. The remainder of the revenue growth, or $193 million, was attributable to FMC’s recent acquisition. Segment earnings of $189 million increased 48 percent year-over-year and were above the top end of our guidance range.

Segment revenue for 2017 was approximately $2.5 billion, an 11 percent increase compared to the prior year. FMC’s legacy Agricultural Solutions revenue increased 3 percent year-over-year. Full-year segment earnings were $486 million, a 21 percent increase compared to the prior year, and segment earnings margin improved 160 basis points to 19.2 percent.

Agricultural Solutions full-year revenue for 2018 is forecasted to be in the range of $3.95 billion to $4.15 billion. The legacy FMC Agricultural Solutions business is expected to increase revenue by 2 to 4 percent, and the acquired business is expected to grow by 6 to 10 percent, which implies underlying growth of approximately 5 percent year-over-year for the combined business. Full-year segment earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are expected to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion. First quarter segment EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $290 million to $320 million.2 

FMC Lithium

FMC Lithium reported fourth quarter segment revenue of $113 million, an increase of 60 percent versus the prior-year quarter. Segment earnings more than doubled year-over-year to $44 million in the quarter. Higher volume from FMC’s new hydroxide operations in China and higher year-over-year prices were the main contributors to growth. 

Segment revenue for 2017 was $347 million, a 32 percent increase compared to the prior year, while full-year segment earnings were $127 million, an 80 percent increase compared to the prior year. Segment earnings margin improved to 36.5 percent, compared to 26.6 percent in 2016.

The outlook for Lithium segment revenue for the full year of 2018 is in the range of $420 million to $460 million, an increase of 27 percent at the mid-point compared to 2017, while the outlook for full-year segment EBITDA is in the range of $180 million to $200 million. This forecast for full-year segment 

Page 3/ FMC Corporation Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results

EBITDA represents an increase of nearly 35 percent at the mid-point compared to the prior year. First quarter segment EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $44 million to $48 million, which, at the mid-point, represents an increase of nearly 80 percent compared to the prior-year quarter.2 

2018 Outlook

FMC expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.60 for the full year 2018 and $1.45 to $1.59 for the first quarter.1 FMC continues to expect it will conduct a separate listing of FMC Lithium in the second half of 2018 to create two separate public companies.

This press release contains certain “non-GAAP financial terms” which are defined on our website www.fmc.com. In addition, we have also provided on our website at www.fmc.com reconciliations of non-GAAP terms to the most directly comparable GAAP term. 

1.Although we provide forecasts for adjusted earnings per share and adjusted cash from operations (both of which are non-GAAP financial measures), we are not able to forecast the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Certain elements of the composition of 

the GAAP amounts are not predictable, making it impractical for us to forecast. Such elements include, but are not limited to, restructuring, acquisition charges, and discontinued operations and related cash activity. As a result, no GAAP outlook is provided.

2.Please see press release schedules for reasons as to why we will begin to present EBITDA which is a non-GAAP measure. The only difference between segment EBIT and segment EBITDA is depreciation and amortization expense. The forecast for depreciation and amortization for 2018 is

(1) The Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measure “Adjusted After-Tax Earnings from Continuing Operations, Attributable to FMC Stockholders”, and its presentation on a per share basis, provides useful information about the Company’s operating results to investors and securities analysts. Adjusted earnings excludes the effects of Corporate special charges, tax-related adjustments and the results of our discontinued operations. The Company also believes that excluding the effects of these items from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of its underlying businesses from period to period.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Three Months Ended December 31, 2017: 

Restructuring and other charges (income) includes an impairment charge to write down certain indefinite-lived intangible assets of the acquired DuPont Crop Protection Business as a result of a triggering event associated with the United States' enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was passed in the fourth quarter. The impairment, solely due to tax reform, impacted the fair value and resulted in a charge of $42.1 million. Additionally, restructuring and other charges (income) include asset write-offs of approximately $1.7 million and $3.3 million within FMC Lithium and Corporate, respectively. Restructuring and other charges (income) also includes $8.3 million of charges for continuing environmental sites treated as a Corporate charge. Amounts also include miscellaneous other charges of $3.7 million.

Press Release Schedules - Page 2

Three Months Ended December 31, 2016: 

Restructuring and other charges (income) includes charges of $27.6 million representing final adjustments to severance, asset write-offs, and other costs associated with the integration of Cheminova within FMC Agricultural Solutions. In the fourth quarter, we also entered into an agreement to obtain certain technology and intellectual property rights related to compounds still under development for our FMC Agricultural Solutions businesses. The $13.2 million paid to acquire these rights was expensed as in-process research and development costs. Restructuring and other charges (income) also includes $19.4 million of charges for continuing environmental sites treated as a Corporate charge. Amounts also include miscellaneous restructuring charges totaling $1.1 million and other charges of $1.0 million.

Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017:

Restructuring and other charges (income) includes an impairment charge to write down certain indefinite-lived intangible assets of the acquired DuPont Crop Protection Business as a result of a triggering event for the United States' enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was passed in the fourth quarter. The impairment, solely due to tax reform, impacted the fair value and resulted in a charge of $42.1 million. Additionally, restructuring and other charges (income) includes $7.7 million of costs related to miscellaneous restructuring efforts and asset-write downs within FMC Lithium. Restructuring and other charges (income) also includes asset write-offs of approximately $2.2 million and $5.5 million within FMC Agricultural Solutions and Corporate, respectively. Restructuring and other charges (income) also includes $4.7 million of exit costs related to the termination of our interest in a variable interest entity that was previously consolidated and part of our FMC Agricultural Solutions segment. Additionally, restructuring and other charges (income) includes charges of continuing environmental sites treated as a Corporate charge of $16.6 million. Remaining restructuring and other charges (income) includes net miscellaneous charges of $2.6 million.

Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016:

Restructuring and other charges (income) includes charges of $42.3 million representing final adjustments to severance, asset write-offs, and other costs associated with the integration of Cheminova within FMC Agricultural Solutions. Integration-related costs associated with the integration of Cheminova were completed at the end of 2016. Amount also includes other miscellaneous restructuring costs of $1.1 million. Additionally, restructuring and other charges (income) includes $36.8 million of charges for continuing environmental sites treated as Corporate charges, $13.2 million associated with a license agreement to obtain certain technology and intellectual property rights for new compounds still under development, and $4.2 million as a result of the Argentina government's action to devalue its currency. These charges were offset by other miscellaneous income of $2.6 million.

(b) Our non-operating pension and postretirement costs are defined as those costs related to interest, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements. These costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and we consider these costs to be outside our operational performance. We exclude these non-operating pension and postretirement costs from our segments as we believe that removing them provides a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our businesses, provides increased transparency and clarity in the performance of our retirement plans and enhances period-over-period comparability. We continue to include the service cost and amortization of prior service cost in our Adjusted Earnings results noted above. We believe these elements reflect the current year operating costs to our businesses for the employment benefits provided to active employees.

(c) Charges related to the expensing of the inventory fair value step-up resulting from the application of acquisition accounting, legal and professional fees and gains or losses on hedging purchase price associated with the completed acquisitions. Amounts represent the following:

These charges are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the condensed consolidated statements of income (loss).

(2)These charges are included in “Costs of sales and services” on the condensed consolidated statements of income (loss).

Press Release Schedules - Page 3

Discontinued operations, net of income taxes include, in periods up to its sale, the results of FMC Health and Nutrition as well as provisions, net of recoveries, for environmental liabilities and legal reserves and expenses related to previously discontinued operations. The three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 include the divestiture gain of approximately $918 million ($727 million, net of tax), which includes $33 million ($28 million, net of tax) of divestiture related costs, associated with the sale of FMC Health and Nutrition which was completed on November 1, 2017. The twelve months ended December 31, 2017 included a $168 million ($148 million, net of tax) impairment charge related to our Omega-3 business which was sold on August 1, 2017.

(f) We exclude the GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from the Non-GAAP measure of income, and instead include a Non-GAAP tax provision based upon the annual Non-GAAP effective tax rate. The GAAP tax provision includes certain discrete tax items including, but not limited to: income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to ongoing business operations in the current year; unusual or infrequently occurring items; tax adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency remeasurement of certain foreign operations; certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years; certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets; and changes in tax law. Management believes excluding these discrete tax items assists investors and securities analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations thereby providing investors with useful supplemental information about FMC's operational performance.

As a result of the Tax Act, the Company has recognized provisional income tax expense of $315.9 million, related to both the remeasurement of the Company’s U.S. net deferred tax asset and the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.

Segment EBITDA

Beginning in 2018 we will present earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") by operating segment, which is a Non-GAAP financial measure. We define segment EBITDA as segment operating profit excluding depreciation and amortization expense. We believe that this Non-GAAP financial measure provides a useful metric for management and investors to better assess operating performance and enables transparency to investors and analysts for period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Due to the recent DuPont Crop Protection Business acquisition, we acquired a large number of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment. The depreciation and amortization on the intangible assets is expected to significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense.

We have provided a reconciliation of Segment Operating Profit to EBITDA by segment for each quarterly period within the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 as well as the full year fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
