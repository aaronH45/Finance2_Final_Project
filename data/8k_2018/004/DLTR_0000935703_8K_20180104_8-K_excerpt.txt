Item 8.01. Other Information

On January 4, 2018, Dollar Tree, Inc. (the “Company”) reported that the Company has settled a previously reported lawsuit relating to the Company’s November 2015 divestiture of 330 Family Dollar stores to Dollar Express LLC, a portfolio company of Sycamore Partners (the “Divestiture”). Under the terms of the settlement, Sycamore Partners and Dollar Express paid the Company $35.0 million. In connection therewith, the parties to the lawsuit agreed to mutual releases and dismissal of the litigation claims and counterclaims with prejudice.

The Company had previously evaluated the collectability of certain receivables from Dollar Express relating to the Divestiture. Based on information then available, the Company determined that outstanding amounts totaling $53.5 million were not recoverable and recorded impairment charges to write down the receivables to zero. The settlement of the litigation is expected to result in a partial reversal of the receivables impairment in the amount of $35.0 million in the Company’s fiscal fourth quarter 2017 Condensed Consolidated Income Statement.
