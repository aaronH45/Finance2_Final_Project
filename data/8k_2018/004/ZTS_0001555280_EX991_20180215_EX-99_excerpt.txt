EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY 

“In 2017, Zoetis became the first animal health company to deliver more than $5 billion in revenue as we continued to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the growth opportunities that are uniquely available in animal health,” said Juan Ramón Alaix, Chief Executive Officer of Zoetis. “We achieved operational revenue growth for the year of 8%, based on the diversity of our product portfolio and balanced performance across the U.S. and all of our major international markets. We also grew our adjusted net income faster than sales, at 21% operationally, as we continue to deliver on our long-term value proposition. 

“As we mark our fifth year as an independent company, I am grateful to the colleagues of Zoetis who have placed us firmly on a course for sustainable profitable growth. We continue to drive innovations, lead in customer excellence and simplify our operations,” said Alaix. “As we look to the future, we will remain committed to strengthening our interconnected capabilities in direct sales, R&D and manufacturing, and look for additional investment opportunities to enhance our short and long term growth.” 

“We finished off 2017 with strong revenue and income growth, while almost doubling our operating cash flow for the year,” said Glenn David, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Zoetis. “For full year 2018, we expect operational growth of 5% to 7% in revenue and 20% to 26% in adjusted net

income, while we continue to improve our working capital and fund investments that will support our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders.”

QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTS 

Zoetis organizes and manages its commercial operations across two regional segments: the United States (U.S.) and International. Within these segments, the company delivers a diverse portfolio of products for livestock and companion animals tailored to local trends and customer needs. In the fourth quarter of 2017:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Revenue in the International segment was $740 million, an increase of 16% on a reported basis and 13% operationally compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Sales of companion animal products grew 23% on a reported basis and 18% on an operational basis, resulting primarily from increased sales of our dermatology portfolio and Simparica. Sales of livestock products grew 14% on a reported basis and 11% on an operational basis, driven by balanced growth across our portfolio. New product launches drove growth in our fish portfolio in Norway as well as in our swine portfolio, primarily across Europe. Sales of cattle products grew primarily in Brazil and Canada, while poultry sales grew primarily across Asia Pacific.

Zoetis continues to drive demand and strengthen its diverse portfolio through the introduction of new products, lifecycle innovations, business development initiatives, strong customer relationships and entry into new markets and technologies. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company received approvals for new indications and formulations and expanded major product lines into new geographies.

•Zoetis continued to expand the availability of its oral flea and tick medication, Simparica, into new markets, with additional approvals in Chile, Panama, the Philippines and Switzerland. The product also received approval in the European Union for the treatment of two additional types of skin mites. Simparica delivers fast and persistent protection from fleas and ticks in dogs, with effectiveness that lasts for a full 35 days, without losing efficacy at the end of the month.

duration of immunity claim for Bordatella bronchiseptica. Vanguard Rapid Resp is the first and only intranasal vaccine line in the U.S. that has been demonstrated to provide one year of protection against these three important canine infectious respiratory diseases. 

•In the U.S., the company enhanced its medicated feed additives portfolio with an expanded claim for Lincomix® (lincomycin hydrochloride), a popular feed medication. This new claim gives pork producers more flexibility when treating swine respiratory disease associated with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyo), which can be devastating to herds.

If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if management's underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Zoetis expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A further list and description of risks, uncertainties and other matters can be found in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in the sections thereof captioned “Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Future Results” and “Item 1A.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and operational results (which exclude the impact of foreign exchange), to assess and analyze our results and trends and to make financial and operational decisions. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors because they provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release should not be considered alternatives to measurements required by GAAP, such as net income, operating income, and earnings per share, and should not be considered measures of liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this press release and are posted on our website at www.zoetis.com.

2018 GUIDANCE 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of early February 2018.

Reconciliations of 2018 reported guidance to 2018 adjusted guidance follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Operational growth (a non-GAAP financial measure) excludes the impact of foreign exchange.

(b)Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are defined as reported U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income and its components and reported diluted EPS excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. Adjusted cost of sales, adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses, and adjusted interest expense and other (income)/deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and, therefore, components of the overall adjusted income measure. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. 

(c)We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted net income operational growth to the most directly comparable GAAP reported financial measure because we are unable to calculate with reasonable certainty the foreign exchange impact of unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, potential future asset impairments and other certain significant items, without unreasonable effort. The foreign exchange impacts of these items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. 

(d)Primarily includes certain nonrecurring costs related to restructuring and other charges for the supply network strategy. Excludes potential net gains/losses on sales of assets.
