Impact of U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the company's fourth quarter 2017 net earnings of $1.98 per diluted share included a $2.09 per share net income tax benefit and for the full year 2017 net earnings of $1.53 per diluted share included a $2.10 per share net income tax benefit. The net income tax benefit is primarily comprised of a $552 million income tax benefit from a revaluation of the company's deferred taxes as a result of the new lower corporate tax rate and a $57 million income tax provision related to the transition tax on deferred foreign earnings. This is a one-time item that affects the comparability of results between periods, and accordingly has been excluded from adjusted net earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA.

Overview of Results

CF Industries Holdings, Inc., today announced fourth quarter 2017 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $465 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, and adjusted net loss of $3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2017 EBITDA was $224 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $260 million. These results compare to fourth quarter 2016 net loss attributable to common stockholders of $320 million, or $1.38 per diluted share; adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter 2016 of $90 million, or $0.39 per diluted share; EBITDA loss of $135 million; and adjusted EBITDA of $133 million. Fourth quarter 2017 results include a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $13 million, compared to a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.

For the full year 2017, net earnings attributable to common stockholders was $358 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, and adjusted net loss was $59 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. Full year 2017 EBITDA was $856 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $969 million. These results compare to full year 2016 net loss attributable to common stockholders of $277 million, or $1.19 per diluted share; adjusted net earnings for full year 2016 of $109 million, or $0.47 per diluted share; EBITDA of $395 million; and adjusted EBITDA of $858 million. Full year 2017 results include a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $26 million, compared to a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $133 million for full year 2016.

“Outstanding execution by the team in 2017 produced records for safe operations, production and sales volumes," said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. "In addition, we paid down $1.1 billion in debt during the quarter and recently exercised our right to purchase all of the publicly traded common units of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. We estimate that full ownership of TNCLP would have added approximately $45 million to EBITDA, including anticipated cost reductions and network optimization benefits. Additionally, we estimate that full ownership of TNCLP and the debt reduction would have resulted in $110 million of additional free cash flow.”

Manufacturing Operations

CF Industries' manufacturing network continued its focus on safety and operated efficiently during the fourth quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2017, CF Industries' 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate was 0.67 incidents per 200,000 work hours, well below industry averages. 

Gross ammonia production during the fourth quarter of 2017 was more than 2.6 million tons, the second highest volume for a quarter in the company's history.

Sales Overview

Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $1,099 million from $867 million in the same period last year due to higher sales volumes across most segments and higher average selling prices across all segments. 

Total sales volumes for the quarter were significantly higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as the company's production increased at the Donaldsonville and Port Neal Nitrogen Complexes. 

Average selling prices for the quarter were higher year-over-year across all segments due largely to a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance. Additionally, average ammonia selling prices benefited from the commencement of delivery under a long-term supply agreement.

The company's average selling price for ammonia was $285 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $277 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2016. The average selling price for urea was $244 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $214 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the average selling price for UAN was $150 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $149 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Cost of sales per ton increased 10 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily driven by increased gas consumption to support the higher production and sales volumes and increased 11 percent for the full year 2017 compared to the full year 2016 for the same volume reasons.

 2 

Controllable cost of sales, defined as non-gas cash costs (maintenance, labor, electricity, other raw materials, transportation and distribution, and other plant costs), which excludes the impact of natural gas, derivatives and depreciation and amortization, decreased 8 percent per ton,(3) in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 2016, and 14 percent per ton,(3) in the full year 2017, as a result of cost reduction initiatives and production efficiencies.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, the average cost of natural gas reflected in the company's cost of sales was $3.24 per MMBtu, which includes a realized loss of $0.13 per MMBtu on natural gas hedges totaling $13 million. This compares to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of $3.24 per MMBtu for the fourth quarter of 2016, which included a realized loss of $0.06 per MMBtu on natural gas hedges totaling $5 million. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the average price of natural gas at Henry Hub in North America was $2.87 per MMBtu, and the average price of natural gas at the National Balancing Point in the United Kingdom was $6.92 per MMBtu.

Additionally, the company recorded an unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to an unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives of $91 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The company did not enter into any additional natural gas derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Market Overview

CF management expects the combination of: a somewhat weaker U.S. dollar; higher energy costs in key producing regions; reduced production in China; higher oil and freight costs; and steady global demand to support nitrogen prices during the first half of 2018 at levels higher than the same period in 2017. 

The U.S. dollar is expected to remain lower against currencies in key nitrogen producing regions through at least the first half of the year, pushing up the cost of nitrogen fertilizer exports in U.S. dollar terms. From the beginning of July 2017 to the beginning of February 2018, the RMB strengthened against the dollar from approximately 6.8 to 6.3 and the Russian Ruble strengthened against the dollar from approximately 60 to 57.

Additionally, energy prices since the middle of 2017 have increased significantly for marginal producers in Eastern Europe and China. From the beginning of July 2017 to the beginning of February 2018, the price of natural gas per MMBtu at TTF in Europe has increased approximately 25 percent and the cost of anthracite coal per metric ton in China has increased 29 percent. Over the same period, the price per MMBtu of natural gas at Henry Hub has increased less than three percent. 

Ocean freight costs have risen as well, adding cost to globally traded nitrogen. At the beginning of February, ocean freight to ship urea from the Arab Gulf to the Gulf of Mexico was 15 percent per ton higher than the year before and nearly 30 percent per ton higher than at the beginning of July 2017.

These factors have accelerated the transformation of China's role in the global urea market. According to official government data, Chinese urea exports have declined approximately 65 percent in two years, from over 13 million metric tons in 2015 to approximately 4.7 million metric tons in 2017. Industry observers expect marginal producers in China to face continued pressures during 2018, not only from higher coal costs and currency impacts, but also from the effect of environmental regulation enforcement. These challenges are likely to further reduce Chinese net urea exports in 2018. 

India and Brazil will remain key countries for urea demand this year. Published reports and CF analysis suggest that India may require 500,000-1,000,000 metric tons of urea to be imported before the end of March to meet that country’s fertilizer needs for 2018. Additionally, Brazil has emerged in recent years as the second largest importer of urea in the world, with imports of approximately 5.4 million metric tons in 2017, 15 percent higher than 2016 and 64 percent higher than 2012. Countries such as Australia, Mexico and Turkey have also significantly increased imports of urea in recent years.

Imports of nitrogen will continue to be necessary to meet expected demand in North America in 2018 with the company projecting that approximately 91 million acres of corn will be planted in the United States. For much of 2017, 

 3 

nitrogen prices in the region discouraged imports. Urea barge prices at New Orleans averaged approximately $25 below international parity during the fourth quarter and only rose above international parity for one week in all of 2017. As a result, imports of urea and UAN from July through December declined 37 percent and 24 percent, respectively, compared to the same period in 2016. Given steady demand and higher netbacks available in other regions, nitrogen prices in North America will likely have to rise to attract the imports necessary to meet expected demand.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures in 2017 totaled $473 million. Of this amount, approximately $350 million was for new activities in 2017 and the remainder was for activities performed in 2016 but paid for in 2017. As of September 30, 2017, the company had $158 million in costs accrued but unpaid for work completed in 2016 related to capacity expansion projects. At December 31, 2017, these costs are no longer the subject of disputes and the company's capital expenditures for 2017 reflect all payments associated with these formerly disputed costs.

Capital expenditures in 2018 for new activity are estimated to be in the range of approximately $400 to $450 million, which takes into account a higher number of plant turnarounds than in 2017. 

Liquidity

As of December 31, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $835 million on the balance sheet, had no borrowings outstanding under its $750 million revolving credit facility and was in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements under its debt instruments.

On December 1, 2017, the company completed the redemption of all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of its 6.875% Senior Notes due May 2018. Additionally, on December 26, 2017, the company purchased $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.125% Senior Notes due 2020 pursuant to a tender offer. As a result, the aggregate principal amount of CF Industries Holdings, Inc.'s outstanding long-term indebtedness was approximately $4.75 billion at the end of 2017, compared to $5.85 billion at the end of 2016. At this level of gross debt, interest expense for 2018 would be approximately $230 million, or $76 million lower than 2017 on an annualized basis. 

Exercise of Right to Purchase All Publicly Traded Units of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.

The company announced on February 7, 2018, that its wholly owned subsidiary Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. has elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the publicly traded common units of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. on April 2, 2018, for a cash purchase price of $84.033 per unit in accordance with the terms of TNCLP’s partnership agreement. The purchase price of all of the publicly traded common units of TNCLP is approximately $390 million. The company intends to fund the purchase with cash on hand. As of the April 2, 2018, purchase date, all rights of the holders of the units will terminate, with the exception of the right to receive payment of the purchase price.

CHS Inc. Distribution

On January 31, 2018, the Board of Managers of CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN) approved a semi-annual distribution payment to CHS Inc. (CHS) of $49 million for the distribution period ended December 31, 2017. The distribution was paid on January 31, 2018. The total distribution to CHS pertaining to 2017 was approximately $108 million.
