FOURTH QUARTER 2017 RESULTS

Luxembourg and Switzerland, our Wealth Management business was named the Best Private Bank in the U.S. by the Financial Times Group for the eighth time in the last nine years, and our Asset Management business surpassed $1 trillion in assets under management. We also returned a record $895.6 million to common shareholders, through increasing our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.42 per share and repurchasing 5.8 million shares. We commend the extraordinary efforts of all of our employees for contributing to these results and, as we begin 2018, we will continue to focus on profitably growing our business.”

Net income per diluted common share for the full year was $4.92, compared to $4.32 in the prior year. Net income for 2017 totaled $1.20 billion, up $166.5 million, or 16%, from $1.03 billion in 2016.

Noninterest income totaled $3.95 billion in 2017, up $219.2 million, or 6%, from $3.73 billion in 2016. Current-year noninterest income increased compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher trust, investment and other servicing fees, including revenue associated with the UBS acquisition, partially offset by lower other operating income, primarily due to income recorded in the prior year from the sale of Visa Inc. Class B common shares partially offset by impairment charges associated with our leasing portfolio, and lower foreign exchange trading income. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis in 2017 totaled $1.48 billion, an increase of $215.0 million, or 17%, from $1.26 billion in 2016, due to higher levels of average earning assets and an increased net interest margin. The net interest margin increased to 1.33% in 2017 from 1.18% in 2016 primarily due to an increase in short-term interest rates. 

Noninterest expense totaled $3.77 billion in 2017, up $298.7 million, or 9%, from $3.47 billion in the prior year, reflecting increased compensation, increased equipment and software expense, and increased outside services, including current-year severance and related charges, expense associated with the UBS acquisition, and a one-time employee cash bonus.

The provision for income taxes in 2016 totaled $484.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 31.9%. The current year includes a net benefit to the tax provision attributable to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, an increased income tax benefit derived from vesting of restricted stock units and stock option exercises, and Federal and State research tax credits due to the completion of a study of the Corporation’s technology spend between 2013 and 2016, each of which resulted in a reduction of the effective tax rate.

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Total stockholders’ equity averaged $10.1 billion, up $491.5 million, or 5% from the prior-year quarter’s average of $9.6 billion.

RECONCILIATION TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT

The following table presents a reconciliation of interest income, net interest income, net interest margin, and total revenue prepared in accordance generally accepted accounting principles to such measures on an FTE basis, which are non-generally accepted accounting financial measures. Management believes this presentation provides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.
