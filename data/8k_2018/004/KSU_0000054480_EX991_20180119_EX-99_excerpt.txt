(a)The Company believes adjusted diluted earnings per share is meaningful as it allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the impacts of the changes in tax law due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The income tax expense impacts related to these adjustments are calculated at the applicable statutory tax rate.
