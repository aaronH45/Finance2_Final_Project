JERSEY CITY, N.J., February 20, 2018 — Verisk Analytics, Inc. (Nasdaq:VRSK), a leading data analytics provider, today announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Scott Stephenson, chairman, president, and CEO, said, "Fourth-quarter results were solid, led by robust organic revenue growth in insurance, positioning us well as we head into 2018. We continue to be excited by the quality of ideas generated through our engagement with clients and the new business opportunities they provide. We are very happy to have closed the PowerAdvocate transaction, capping a year of strong acquisitions. Our near-term focus will turn to integration and execution."

Lee Shavel, CFO and executive vice president, said, "Continued growth and cash flow generation enabled us to generate capital for deployment through internal investment, acquisitions, debt repayment and share repurchases in 2017. We expect to continue to work back to our leverage target and to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases in 2018. I look forward to working with our management to optimize capital allocation across the enterprise to improve returns."

for the full year. Growth was led by an increase in underwriting solutions subscription revenue. Reported results include the recent acquisition of The GeoInformation Group in fourth-quarter 2016. 

Expenses, Income, and Adjusted EBITDA

Cost of revenues increased 8.2% in the fourth quarter and 9.7% for the full year compared with the respective prior-year periods. Excluding the $14.5 million ESOP payment in 2016, the increases were 16.9% and 12.0%, in the fourth quarter and for the full year, respectively. On an organic basis, cost of revenues decreased 0.7% in the fourth quarter and increased 3.4% for the full year. Excluding the 2016 ESOP payment, the organic increases were 7.4% and 5.5%, in the fourth quarter and for the full year, respectively. The year-over-year increase, excluding the 2016 ESOP payment, is primarily due to contributions from acquisitions, salaries and benefits, and information technology costs. 

Selling, general, and administrative expense, or SG&A, increased 13.0% in the quarter and 7.0% for the full year, primarily due to acquisition-related costs and other expenses related to supporting business growth. Excluding the $4.3 million ESOP payment in 2016, SG&A increased 19.6% in the quarter and 8.6% for the full year. On an organic basis, SG&A increased 9.0% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the full year. Excluding the 2016 ESOP payment, the organic increases were 15.5% and 4.0%, respectively. 

Net Income increased 90.4% to $205 million in the fourth quarter and 23.0% to $555 million for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 6.9% in the quarter and 4.3% for the full year. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Earnings Per Share

Diluted GAAP EPS was $1.22 in the fourth quarter and $3.29 for the full year. 

Diluted adjusted EPS was $1.34 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 67.5% compared with the same period in 2016. Diluted adjusted EPS was $3.74 for the full year, an increase of 20.3% compared with 2016. The 2017 tax reform legislation benefited diluted adjusted EPS by $0.53 in the fourth quarter and for the full year due to a tax benefit resulting from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities. The remaining increase was primarily due to organic growth in the business, acquisitions, and a lower share count. 

Cash Flow

Net cash provided by operating activities was $744 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017. Capital expenditures increased 25.8% to $184 million and were 8.6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. Free cash flow was $560 million for the full year, an increase of 9.8% after excluding $100 million of taxes paid related to the sale of the healthcare business in 2016. This represented 53.4% of adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017.

Share Repurchases and Financing Activities

The company repurchased 3.4 million shares for the full year for a total return of capital to shareholders of $270 million. At December 31, 2017, the company had $366 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.

Forward-Looking Statements

This release contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or to future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “target,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control and that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.

Other factors that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements can be found in Verisk’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what we projected. Any forward-looking statement in this release reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, growth strategy, and liquidity. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Notes Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The company has provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding its operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The company believes that its presentation of 

4

non-GAAP measures, such as organic constant currency revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income from continuing operations, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow, provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the company’s management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the company and for budgeting and planning purposes.

Our operating results, reported in U.S. dollars, are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying foreign currencies in which we transact change in value over time compared to the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we present certain constant currency financial information to provide a framework to assess how our businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We use the term “constant currency” to present results that have been adjusted to exclude foreign currency impact. Foreign currency impact represents the differences in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. This impact is calculated by translating comparable prior-period year results at the currency exchange rates used in the current period, rather than the exchange rates in effect during the prior period. Organic revenue excludes revenue from our recent acquisitions that have not been consolidated for a full prior annual period.

Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of our segments. In all periods shown here and going forward, the company defines “adjusted EBITDA” as net income from continuing operations before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, 2016 nonrecurring severance charges and gain on sale of equity investments, excluding a fourth-quarter 2016 nonrecurring ESOP payment.

Although securities analysts, lenders, and others frequently use EBITDA in their evaluation of companies, EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our statement of cash flow reported under U.S. GAAP. Management uses adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with traditional U.S. GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance. Some of these limitations are as follows:

•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.

•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs.

•Although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

•Other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of their calculations as comparative measures.

See Table 3 (below) for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to income from continuing operations, Table 4 for a reconciliation of adjusted net income to income from continuing operations, and Table 5 for a reconciliation of free cash flow from continuing operations to net cash provided by operating activities.
