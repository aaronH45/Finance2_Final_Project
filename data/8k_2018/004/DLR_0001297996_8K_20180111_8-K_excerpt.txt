Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On January 17, 2018, Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (the “company”) announced the appointment of Erich Sanchack, age 47, as Executive Vice President, Operations of the company effective as of January 25, 2018 (the “Start Date”).

Mr. Sanchack has been employed with CenturyLink, a telecommunications company, since November 2016, most recently holding the position of Senior Vice President, IT Solutions and New Market Development. Prior to joining CenturyLink, Mr. Sanchack served in roles of increasing responsibility at Lockheed Martin, an aerospace and defense company, from 2004 to October 2016, most recently serving as Vice President, Competitive Enhancements. 

There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Sanchack and any other person pursuant to which Mr. Sanchack was selected as an officer. There are no transactions in which Mr. Sanchack has an interest requiring disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

On January 11, 2018, the company and DLR LLC (collectively, “Digital Realty”) entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Sanchack, pursuant to which Mr. Sanchack will serve as the company's Executive Vice President, Operations effective as of the Start Date.

The employment agreement has an initial one-year term, and will automatically be extended for one additional year upon the expiration of the initial term unless either party provides notice of non-renewal to the other.

Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. Sanchack’s initial annual base salary is $445,000. Mr. Sanchack is also eligible to earn an annual cash performance bonus targeted at 100% of his base salary under the company’s incentive bonus plan based on the satisfaction of performance criteria established in accordance with the terms of such plan. 

Pursuant to the employment agreement, subject to his continued employment with Digital Realty through the payment date, Mr. Sanchack is eligible to receive a one-time cash payment equal to $562,000 (the "Sign-On Bonus"). In the event Mr. Sanchack voluntarily resigns his employment or Digital Realty terminates his employment for "cause" within one year of the Effective Date he will be required to repay Digital Realty a prorated amount of the Sign-On Bonus.

In connection with Mr. Sanchack’s appointment, Mr. Sanchack will receive (i) an award of time-based profits interest units of Digital Realty Trust, L.P.

Mr. Sanchack will also receive a new hire equity award of time-based profits interest units of the operating partnership (or restricted stock units covering company common stock) with a value of approximately $750,000. 

Mr. Sanchack’s employment agreement provides that if his employment is terminated by Digital Realty without “cause” or by Mr. Sanchack for “good reason” (each as defined in the employment agreement) or in the event of his death or disability, then, subject to the terms and conditions of the employment agreement, he will be entitled to certain severance payments.

The foregoing description of the employment agreement with Mr. Sanchack is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the employment agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
