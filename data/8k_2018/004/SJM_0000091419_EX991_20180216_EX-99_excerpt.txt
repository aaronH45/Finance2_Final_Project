The J. M. Smucker Company Announces Fiscal 2018 Third Quarter Results

ORRVILLE, Ohio, Feb. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The J. M. Smucker Company (NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the third quarter ended January 31, 2018, of its 2018 fiscal year. All comparisons are to the third quarter of the prior fiscal year, unless otherwise noted. 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Net sales increased 1 percent, reflecting growth across most of the Company's key brands and categories. Net income per diluted share was $7.32, including a substantial nonrecurring benefit related to recently enacted U.S. income tax reform, partially offset by a noncash impairment charge within the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.50, an increase of 25 percent, including approximately $0.35 per share related to a lower current year tax rate due to U.S. income tax reform. Cash provided by operating activities was $469.0 million, compared to $419.5 million in the prior year. Free cash flow was $388.7 million in the quarter and $693.3 million through the first nine months of fiscal 2018. The Company increased its full-year 2018 earnings and free cash flow outlook. With the benefit resulting from U.S. income tax reform, the Company contributed an incremental $20.0 million to its employee pension plan and has announced a one-time bonus of $1,000 to nearly 5,000 employees and a $1 million increase to its charitable contributions. 

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER REMARKS

"We had a strong third quarter, with sales growth for key brands in every business and strong earnings per share growth fueled by the benefits of U.S. income tax reform and ongoing cost discipline," said Mark Smucker, Chief Executive Officer. "These results reflect our commitment to delivering top and bottom line growth and supporting our portfolio of iconic and emerging brands. In addition, the benefits of income tax reform provide incremental fuel to invest in our growth initiatives and support our employees and communities as well as opportunities to increase cash returned to shareholders."

THIRD QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Sales 

Net sales increased $24.5 million, or 1 percent. Favorable volume/mix increased net sales by 1 percentage point, primarily driven by growth in pet food and coffee, partially offset by declines in the oils category. Net price realization slightly offset some of the volume/mix gains, driven by lower net pricing within pet food. Favorable foreign currency exchange contributed $5.8 million to net sales. 

Operating Income 

Gross profit increased $5.6 million, or 1 percent, reflecting favorable volume/mix, primarily attributed to the coffee category. Selling, distribution, and administrative ("SD&A") expenses decreased $5.3 million, driven by the Company's cost savings initiatives, which more than offset an increase in marketing expense. Operating income decreased $75.0 million, primarily reflecting a $176.9 million noncash impairment charge associated with the goodwill and certain indefinite-lived trademarks within the Company's U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment, while the prior year included a $75.7 million noncash impairment charge. The current year charge resulted from reduced growth expectations for the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment. A reduction in other special project costs of $12.4 million also contributed to the change in operating income.

On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted gross profit increased $8.9 million, or 1 percent. Adjusted operating income increased $17.0 million, or 4 percent, with the primary difference from GAAP results being the exclusion of the impairment charges, amortization, and special project costs. 

Other 

Net interest expense increased $2.8 million. The Company recognized an income tax benefit of $715.3 million in the third quarter. This included a $765.8 million net benefit related to the recently enacted U.S. income tax reform, primarily reflecting the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by the transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings. Excluding these nonrecurring items, the Company's adjusted effective tax rate was 19.7 percent in the third quarter, which included the benefit of a lower current year tax rate due to U.S. income tax reform. This resulted in a 28.2 percent rate through the first nine months of fiscal 2018.

FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK 

The Company updated its full-year fiscal 2018 guidance as summarized below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net sales are expected to be in the range of flat to down slightly, compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to range from $8.20 to $8.30, based on 113.6 million shares outstanding. The increase in earnings and cash flow guidance primarily reflects the benefit of a lower effective tax rate as a result of U.S. income tax reform, partially offset by anticipated freight cost increases and a charge related to obsolete inventory in the third quarter. The above guidance excludes any potential impact following completion of the Company's previously announced definitive agreement to acquire the Wesson® oil brand from Conagra Brands, Inc., which is pending regulatory approval. For fiscal 2019, the Company projects an effective tax rate of 23 percent.

Non-GAAP Measures 

The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, including: net sales excluding foreign currency exchange; adjusted gross profit, operating income, income, and earnings per share; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and impairment charges related to intangible assets ("EBITDA (as adjusted)"); and free cash flow, as key measures for purposes of evaluating performance internally. The Company believes that these measures provide useful information to investors because they are the measures used to evaluate performance on a comparable year-over-year basis. 

Non-GAAP profit measures exclude certain items affecting comparability which include amortization expense and impairment charges related to intangible assets, integration and restructuring costs ("special project costs"), and unallocated gains and losses on commodity and foreign currency exchange derivatives ("unallocated derivative gains and losses"). The special project costs relate to specific integration and restructuring projects, and the unallocated derivative gains and losses reflect the changes in fair value of the Company's commodity and foreign currency exchange contracts. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company expanded its non-GAAP measures to also exclude certain one-time discrete tax adjustments. These adjustments include the provisional effect of the one-time items associated with U.S. income tax reform, which includes certain discrete adjustments related to the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities remeasurement and transition tax. Also included in the one-time discrete tax adjustments is the permanent tax difference related to the goodwill impairment charge that was recorded during the third quarter of 2018. The Company believes that excluding these one-time discrete tax adjustments in its non-GAAP measures provides comparability across the periods presented and better reflects the benefit of a lower blended U.S. statutory tax rate on its current year earnings as a result of U.S. income tax reform.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Rather, the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures supplements other metrics used by management to internally evaluate its businesses and facilitates the comparison of past and present operations and liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and may exclude certain nondiscretionary expenses and cash payments. A reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measure for the current and prior year periods is included in the "Unaudited Non-GAAP Financial Measures" tables. The Company has also provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures for its fiscal 2018 outlook. As the amount of unallocated derivative gains and losses varies depending on market conditions and levels of derivative transactions with respect to a particular fiscal year, it is not determinable on a forward-looking basis and no guidance has been provided.
