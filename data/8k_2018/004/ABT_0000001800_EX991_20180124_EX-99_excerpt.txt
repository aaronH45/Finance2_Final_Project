· Fourth-quarter reported sales growth of 42.3 percent; comparable operational sales growth of 7.7 percent 

· Numerous new product approvals and launches across diverse business portfolio 

· Issues earnings outlook for 2018, reflecting strong double-digit growth 

ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Jan. 24, 2018 — Abbott today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017. 

· Fourth-quarter worldwide sales of $7.6 billion increased 42.3 percent on a reported basis and 7.7 percent on a comparable operational* basis. 

· Reported diluted EPS from continuing operations under GAAP was a $(0.50) loss in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the net expense of $1.46 billion for the estimated1 impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform). Excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform and other specified items, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.74 in the fourth quarter, at the high end of the previous guidance range of $0.72 to $0.74. 

· Abbott issues full-year 2018 guidance for diluted EPS from continuing operations on a GAAP basis of $1.22 to $1.32. Projected full-year adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations is $2.80 to $2.90, reflecting 14.0 percent growth2 at the midpoint. 

· In October, Abbott received U.S. FDA clearance for its Confirm Rx™ Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM), the world’s first and only smartphone-compatible ICM designed to help physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias, and obtained CE Mark for XIENCE Sierra™, the newest generation of the company’s gold-standard XIENCE everolimus-eluting coronary stent system. 

· In November, Abbott initiated the U.S. launch of FreeStyle® Libre, the only continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system available that comes factory-calibrated and removes the need for routine fingersticks3 for people with diabetes. In January, Abbott announced that FreeStyle Libre is now available and approved for coverage by the U.S. Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). 

· In December, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for magnetic resonance (MR)-conditional labeling for its Quadra Assura™ and Quadra Assura MP™ cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices and its Fortify Assura™ implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). With these approvals, Abbott has MR-conditional labeling for its full suite of pacemaker, ICD and CRT-D devices. 

“2017 was a great year for us — we performed well, our new product pipeline was highly productive and we took some very important strategic steps forward,” said Miles D. White, chairman and chief executive officer, Abbott. “We’re entering 2018 with very good momentum.”

FOURTH-QUARTER BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

Note: Management believes that measuring sales growth rates on a comparable operational basis is an appropriate way for investors to best understand the underlying performance of the business. 

Comparable operational sales growth:

· Excludes prior year and current year results for the Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) and St. Jude Medical vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter 2017; 

· Excludes the current year results for Rapid Diagnostics, which reflect results for Alere, Inc., which was acquired on Oct. 3, 2017; and 

· Excludes the impact of exchange. 

Following are sales by business segment and commentary for the fourth quarter and the full year:

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

* Total Abbott sales from continuing operations include Other Sales of $17 million. In 2016, the AMO business, which was divested during the first quarter 2017, was reported as part of the Medical Devices group. Comparable operational growth rates above exclude results from the AMO business. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

* In 2017, total Abbott sales from continuing operations include Other Sales of $237 million, including sales of $175 million from the AMO business, which was divested during the first quarter 2017.

n/a = Not Applicable. 

Note: In order to compute results excluding the impact of exchange rates, current year U.S. dollar sales are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the prior year average foreign exchange rates. 

Fourth-quarter 2017 worldwide sales of $7.6 billion increased 42.3 percent on a reported basis. On a comparable operational basis, worldwide sales increased 7.7 percent. Refer to pages 17 and 18 for a reconciliation of comparable historical revenue.

Worldwide Pediatric Nutrition sales increased 2.4 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter, including a favorable 0.9 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 1.5 percent on an operational basis. In the U.S., continued above-market growth was led by Abbott’s market-leading toddler brands, PediaSure® and Pedialyte®. International sales decreased 0.2 percent on an operational basis, as growth in China and India was offset by continued challenging market conditions in certain other international countries. 

Worldwide Adult Nutrition sales increased 3.6 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter, including a favorable 0.8 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 2.8 percent on an operational basis. Worldwide sales growth was led by Ensure®, Abbott’s market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna®, Abbott’s market-leading diabetes-specific nutrition brand.

Molecular Diagnostics sales increased 4.2 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter, including a favorable 1.8 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 2.4 percent on an operational basis. As expected, growth in infectious disease testing, Abbott’s core area of focus in the molecular diagnostics market, was partially offset by a planned scale down in other testing areas, primarily in the U.S. 

Point of Care Diagnostics sales increased 7.2 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter, including a favorable 0.4 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 6.8 percent on an operational basis, led by continued adoption of Abbott’s i-STAT® handheld system.

Worldwide Medical Devices sales increased 102.2 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter. On a comparable operational basis, sales increased 9.6 percent. Refer to pages 17 and 18 for a reconciliation of comparable historical revenue. 

In Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation, worldwide sales in the fourth quarter were led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart and Neuromodulation. In Electrophysiology, during the fourth quarter, Abbott initiated the U.S. launch of its Confirm Rx Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM), the world’s first and only smartphone-compatible ICM designed to help physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias. Growth in Structural Heart was driven by MitraClip®, Abbott’s market-leading device for the minimally-invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation. In Heart Failure, sales growth was led by market uptake of Abbott’s HeartMate 3™ system, which received U.S. FDA approval in the third quarter of 2017. In Neuromodulation, strong double-digit growth was led by several recently launched products for the treatment of chronic pain and movement disorders. 

In the fourth quarter, in Rhythm Management, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for MR-conditional labeling for its Quadra Assura and Quadra Assura MP cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices and its Fortify Assura implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).

During the fourth quarter, Abbott initiated the U.S. launch of FreeStyle Libre, and in January 2018, Abbott announced that FreeStyle Libre is now available and approved for coverage by CMS.
