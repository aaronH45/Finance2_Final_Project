CEO COMMENTARY

Harris H. Simmons, Chairman and CEO, commented, “We are pleased with the results of both the quarter and the year. Fourth quarter earnings per share increased to $0.80, a 33% increase over the prior-year period, when adjusted for both the deferred tax asset revaluation and the larger charitable contribution expense, which were directly related to the passage of tax reform legislation. When adjusted for these items, the efficiency ratio improved materially to 59.8%, and the return on tangible common equity rose to 10.9%, up from 8.4% in the year-ago period.” Mr. Simmons continued, “We were pleased with loan growth over the year-ago period, which increased at a rate roughly double that of large domestic commercial banks. We’ve also seen strong improvement in credit quality, with classified loans and other measures of quality at their best levels in a number of years.”

Mr. Simmons concluded, “We are pleased to have achieved each of the financial goals we established in mid-2015, and we remain focused on building a culture of continuous improvement and operational excellence that will allow us to continue to produce profitable growth in the years ahead.”

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net interest income increased to $526 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $480 million. The $46 million, or 10%, increase in net interest income was due to a $39 million increase in interest and fees on loans resulting from loan growth in commercial and consumer loans and increases in short-term interest rates, and a $21 million increase in interest on securities, resulting from a 3.4 billion, or 28%, increase in the size of the average investment securities portfolio. Interest expense increased $15 million primarily due to an increase in wholesale borrowings and a $4 million increase in interest on deposits.

The net interest margin remained at 3.45% in the fourth quarter of 2017 when compared with the third quarter of 2017. The rate paid on total average deposits and average wholesale borrowings increased by 1 basis point and 9 basis points, respectively. The rate earned on average available-for-sale securities decreased 8 basis points due to increased prepayments of Small Business Administration (“SBA”) backed securities. These changes were offset during the quarter by an increase in the average loan yield (3 basis points), primarily on commercial real estate loans (8 basis points) and commercial loans (4 basis points).

Total noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by $11 million, or 9%, to $139 million from $128 million. The increase was driven by a $9 million increase in customer-related fees and a $6 million increase in dividends and other investment income as a result of increased market values of the Company’s Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”) investments, partially offset by a $7 million decrease in other noninterest income primarily related to a decline in fair value and nonhedge derivative income resulting from fair value adjustments. The increase in customer-related fees was primarily due to increases in credit card fee income.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 For information on non-GAAP financial measures, see pages 18-21.

Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $417 million and included a $12 million charitable contribution, which was largely attributable to the passing of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (“the Act”). Excluding the effect of the contribution, noninterest expense was $405 million, which is generally stable when compared with the $404 million of noninterest expense in the same prior year period.

Salaries and employee benefits increased $13 million as a result of higher incentive compensation, increases in base salaries, and an increase in the Company’s profit sharing contribution to the 401(k) plan. The increase in other noninterest expense reflects the $12 million charitable contribution previously discussed. These increases were partially offset by a $5 million decline in professional and legal services primarily due to a decrease in consulting services, and a $4 million decline in the provision for unfunded lending commitments. 

Adjusted noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $20 million, or 5%, to $415 million compared with $395 million for the same prior year period. Adjusted noninterest expense for 2017 increased $61 million, or 4%, to $1.640 billion compared with $1.579 billion for 2016. Excluding the charitable contribution, the increase was $49 million, or 3%, which was consistent with the goal to hold adjusted noninterest expense growth to 2-3% for the full-year 2017.

Zions met its goal that was initially established in June 2015 to achieve an efficiency ratio in the low 60% range for 2017, with an efficiency ratio of 62.3%. We expect adjusted noninterest expense to increase slightly in 2018 compared with 2017, although we expect revenue to grow at a faster pace, and therefore, we expect additional improvement in the efficiency ratio in 2018. Longer term, we expect the efficiency ratio to be near 60% for the full year 2019. Incentive compensation will continue to be closely aligned with profitability improvement and income growth objectives. For information on non-GAAP financial measures, see pages 18-21.

Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. The Act makes significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including a decrease in the current corporate federal income tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective January 1, 2018. The estimated impact of the Act on the net deferred tax asset resulted in a non-cash charge of $47 million through income tax expense. Excluding the effects of stock-based compensation and state tax law changes, Zions expects its 2018 statutory and effective tax rates to both be in the 24%-25% range.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Asset quality improved for the entire loan portfolio when compared with the prior quarter and the same prior year period, primarily due to improvements in the oil and gas-related portfolio, highlighted by decreases in classified and nonperforming assets. Classified loans and nonperforming assets for the oil and gas-related portfolio decreased $327 million and $143 million, respectively, from the fourth quarter of 2016.

The Company recorded a $(12) million provision for credit losses during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $1 million during the third quarter of 2017 and less than $1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The $(12) million provision is primarily the result of improving credit quality in the oil and gas-related portfolio and a partial release of the reserve taken for Hurricane Harvey in the third quarter of 2017. The allowance for credit losses was $576 million at December 31, 2017, compared with $632 million at December 31, 2016, or 1.29% and 1.48% of loans and leases, respectively.

Loans and leases, net of unearned income and fees, increased $2.1 billion, or 5%, to $44.8 billion at December 31, 2017 from $42.6 billion at December 31, 2016, predominantly in commercial and industrial loans and 1-4 family residential loans. Commercial real estate loans declined slightly from the prior year, primarily due to payoffs and moderate originations because of active management of credit risk concentrations. Unfunded lending commitments increased to $20.5 billion at December 31, 2017, compared with $19.3 billion at December 31, 2016. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total deposits decreased by $0.6 billion, or 1%, from $53.2 billion at December 31, 2016. Average total deposits increased slightly to $52.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $52.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased to $24.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $23.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, and were 46% of average total deposits compared with 45% for the same prior year period. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company increased its common stock dividend to $0.16 cents per share from $0.12 cents per share in third quarter of 2017. Common stock repurchases during the current quarter totaled $115

million, or 2.3 million shares, which is equivalent to 1.2% of common stock as of September 30, 2017, at an average price of $49.57 per share. The Company has repurchased $320 million, or 7.0 million shares, of common stock during the last four quarters at an average price of $45.66 per share. The Company has $235 million of buyback capacity remaining in its 2017 capital plan, which spans the timeframe of July 2017 to June 2018. Weighted average diluted shares increased by 4.2 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, as repurchased shares were more than offset by the dilutive impact of warrants that have been outstanding since 2008 (“TARP” warrants - NASDAQ: ZIONZ) and 2010 (NASDAQ: ZIONW) and employee grants. 

Preferred stock decreased by $144 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 as a result of the Company redeeming all outstanding shares of its 7.90% Series F Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock during the second quarter of 2017. Preferred dividends are expected to be $7.5 million for the first and third quarters of 2018 and $9.6 million for the second and fourth quarters of 2018. 

Tangible book value per common share increased to $30.87 at December 31, 2017, compared with $29.06. The estimated Basel III common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio was 12.1% at December 31, 2017 compared with 12.1%. Basel III capital ratios are based on the applicable phase-in periods; however, the fully phased-in ratio is not substantially different.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations

(Unaudited)

This press release presents non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to provide investors with additional information. The adjustments to reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the following schedules. The Company considers these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and provide a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to assess the performance and financial position of the Company and for presentations of Company performance to investors. The Company further believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, and are not required to be uniformly applied by individual entities. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company, they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP.

The following are the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release and a discussion of why management uses these non-GAAP measures:

Tangible Book Value per Common Share – this schedule also includes “tangible common equity.” Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides additional useful information about the level of tangible equity in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.

Return on Average Tangible Common Equity – this schedule also includes “net earnings applicable to common shareholders, excluding the effects of the adjustments, net of tax” and “average tangible common equity.” Return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides useful information about the Company’s use of shareholders’ equity. Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.

Efficiency Ratio – this schedule also includes “adjusted noninterest expense,” “taxable-equivalent net interest income,” “adjusted taxable-equivalent revenue,” and “adjusted pre-provision net revenue (“PPNR”).” The methodology of determining the efficiency ratio may differ among companies. Management makes adjustments to exclude certain items as identified in the subsequent schedules which it believes allows for more consistent comparability among periods. Management believes the efficiency ratio provides useful information regarding the cost of generating revenue. Adjusted noninterest expense provides a measure as to how well the Company is managing its expenses, and adjusted PPNR enables management and others to assess the Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. Taxable-equivalent net interest income allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The efficiency ratio and adjusted noninterest expense are the key metrics to which the Company announced it would hold itself accountable in its June 1, 2015 efficiency initiative, and to which executive compensation is tied.
