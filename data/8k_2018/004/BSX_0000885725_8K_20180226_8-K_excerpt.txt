Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriters agreed to purchase $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 4.000% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”) under the Company’s shelf registration statement.

These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications, as described in the Indenture. The Indenture also provides for customary events of default.

The foregoing descriptions of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the 2028 Notes are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such documents, which are Exhibits 1.1, 4.1 and 4.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, respectively, and all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
