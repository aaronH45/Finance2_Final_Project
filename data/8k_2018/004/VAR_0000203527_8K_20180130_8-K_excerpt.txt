Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure. 

Management of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (the “Company”) used the information in the presentation slides attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 in a conference call with institutional investors and analysts earlier this morning. The attached presentation will be accessible through the “Investors” section of Company’s website at www.varian.com. 

In the Company’s press release announcing the acquisition of Sirtex Medical Limited, the Company stated that it expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after the closing of the transaction. During the analyst and investor call earlier today, the Company was asked if it would be accretive with or without amortization. The Company mistakenly indicated that it would be accretive with amortization. The Company wishes to clarify that the acquisition is expected to be accretive on a non-GAAP basis, excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, for the first full fiscal year after closing the transaction. 

The information included in this Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 that is provided pursuant to this Item 7.01, is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
