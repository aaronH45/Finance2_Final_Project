 CECL Readiness Status Infrastructure is being developed to calculate CECL estimates Calculating CECL estimates based on: Modified CCAR econometric credit losses models to forecast loan losses over the contractual life of a loan or security Long-term average loss estimates based on credit attributes Individually-evaluated assets Fine tuning models which require review by Credit Administration and Internal Audit It is too early to estimate CECL’s effect on the allowance level which may vary under current economic conditions depending on how key CECL practices develop including: Use of one forecast or probability weighting multiple forecasts (similar to IFRS 9) Length of the reasonable and supportable forecast period Reversion to historical loss information following the reasonable and supportable period at the input level or based on the entire loss estimate The extent to which defaults beyond the contractual term (following renewals) of financial assets are considered Regulators and auditors may provide additional feedback on the assumptions CECL preparations are well underway and on track for parallel runs prior to the effective date

 Profitability: Solid Improvement Since 2014 Source: SNL Financial/S&P Global, Zions calculations *Adjusted ROA and ROTCE for ZION excludes gains/losses on fixed income securities, debt extinguishment and preferred stock redemption cost, and reserve release, which is defined as provision for credit losses net of NCOs, Zions results adjusted in 2Q17 to exclude $16 million of interest income from loan recoveries on four loans and a charitable foundation contribution of $12 million and $47 million revaluation adjustment for the deferred tax asset in 4Q17. Peer group results have been adjusted for DTA recalculation in 4Q17. Improvement driven primarily by positive operating leverage via the efficiency initiative  

 The Big Picture: Zions is a Commercially-Oriented Bank Earning Assets Liabilities and Equity 55% of earning assets are commercial loans (vs. 45% for peers), and 36% of liabilities and equity are funded by noninterest-bearing deposits (vs. 25% for peers) Note: SNL Financial/S&P Global as of 4Q17.

 Net interest income increased 22% since 4Q14 and 10% over the year-ago period Majority of the increase attributable to: Disciplined deposit pricing Increases in interest and fees on loans due to loan growth in commercial and consumer loans Remixing the liquidity portfolio (cash and securities) toward increased securities and less cash and cash equivalents Short-term benchmark interest rates Interest revenue increases were partially offset by modestly higher interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds Revenue: Net Interest Income Net Interest Income Growth due primarily to earning asset growth and disciplined loan and deposit pricing ($mm) (1) 2Q17 results included $16 million of interest recovery income related to four loans. 

 Revenue: Net Interest Income Drivers Net Interest Margin has expanded moderately Net Interest Margin (NIM) Avg Earning Asset Mix During the rising rate environment the NIM has expanded moderately due in part to remixing of the balance sheet Yield on loans has been generally stable, in part due to: reduced benefit from loans purchased from the FDIC (PCI loans) increased proportion of residential mortgage Cost of funding has been generally stable Loan Yield Securities Yield Interest Expense Net Interest Margin Cash Yield 4Q14 4Q17 Short Term Resets or Maturities (loans only) Percent of Loans Hedges (swaps, floors) Net Percentage of Portfolio (1) Prime and 1M Libor 46% -3% 43% 2-3M Libor 4% -- 4% 4-12M Libor 5% -- 5% Other Lns <12 months 10% 1% 11% Longer-term Resets or Maturities 1-5 years 24% -- 24% 5+ years 11% -- 11% (1) Net percentage column sums to less than 100% due primarily to 2% of total loans that have interest rate floors which are in the money (floor rate > index+spread rate); these $1.0 billion of loan balances with floors have a weighted average “in the money” amount of 48 basis points. After giving effect to potential future rate hikes, loans with floors would no longer be subject to the floors and would begin to reset with the relevant indices and therefore the 99% total at December 31, 2017 would increase to/towards 100%. Because the dates at which the floors would no longer be in effect are not certain (subject to future Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions), the timing of such cannot be reflected in the chart. 

 Revenue: Loan Yield Comparison Zions’ loan yield has consistently been in the top quartile Loan Yield Loan Yield Substantial Benefit from Purchase Credit Impaired Loans (loans purchased from the FDIC in 2009)  

 Much of the reduction in rate sensitivity was due to securities purchases during 2016 and early 2017 The average investment portfolio is $11.4 billion higher than 4Q14; taxable-equivalent interest income from the investment portfolio increased nearly $130 million in FY17 compared with FY16 Zions and the peer median experienced a cumulative 44% and 46% deposit beta during 2004-5 rising interest rate period, respectively, although for the first 200 bps the beta for Zions and Peers was 19% and 24%, respectively Revenue: Interest Rate Sensitivity and Historical Deposit Beta Zions has partially reduced asset sensitivity in exchange for current income Source: Company filings and SNL Financial/S&P Global. Cumulative rate hike cycle beta includes one full year for deposit costs to catch up to the changes in the benchmark rates. Chart begins one quarter preceding the first increase in Fed Funds rate for each cycle.

 Noninterest Expense Zions’ noninterest expense growth has been well below peers Source: SNL Financial/S&P Global. Data adjusted to account for major acquisitions. Zions results adjusted to exclude a charitable foundation contribution of $12 million in 4Q17. Results also adjusted for items such as severance, provision for unfunded lending commitments, securities gains and losses and debt extinguishment costs. Indexed Noninterest Expense 

 The efficiency ratio in 4Q17 was 61.6%, declining about 3 percentage points from 64.5% in the year-ago period Excluding the charitable contribution previously referenced, the efficiency ratio was 59.8% Achieved low 60 percent range of 62.3% for 2017 Committed to continued improvement to the efficiency ratio, although moderating from the trailing three year pace Efficiency Ratio Efficiency Ratio (1) Substantial improvement driven by both revenue growth and expense control (1) Defined as noninterest expenses as a percentage of net revenue, adjusted for items such as severance, provision for unfunded lending commitments, securities gains and losses and debt extinguishment costs. See Appendix for GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation table. 

 Tax Rates The effective tax rate for 2018 is estimated to be between 24% and 25%, down from the adjusted effective tax rate of 34.8% in 2017 2017 adjusted effective tax rate of 34.8% excludes the effect of: DTA adjustment of $47 million One time state tax adjustments in the first half of 2017 Application of ASU 2016-09 which changed the accounting for stock-based compensation The estimated 2018 annual effective tax rate presented is based on 2017 information and does not consider the impact related to stock-based compensation.

 Profitability: Zions Not Satisfied with Median Performance Zions expects to continue to drive profitability higher Keys to improving profitability over the next two-plus years include: Moderate loan growth (mid-single digits) Economic backdrop and improved internal processes provide meaningful opportunities for loan growth Stability in various loan types that have been declining, in some cases nearly 10 years More than $6 billion attrition of construction and land development loans More than $3 billion attrition of National Real Estate (SBA 504 or 504-like) loans $1 billion attrition of oil and gas loans Moderate fee income growth Slight noninterest expense growth (2%-3% annually) Slight to moderate credit costs, due to Very strong credit and risk management Relatively benign credit macro environment  

 Next 12-Month Financial Outlook (4Q18E, vs. 4Q17A) Outlook Comments Moderately Increasing Over the next 12 months, we expect continued strong growth from residential mortgage and municipal loans, moderate growth in C&I and CRE loans Moderately Increasing Excludes the effects of future interest rate hikes, but includes the expected benefit from the December 2017 fed funds rate hike of 25 basis points. Contemplates continued increases in loans and a moderate increase in funding costs Modest Expect quarterly loan loss provisions to be modest. May experience reserve releases as credit quality continues to improve, offset by reserves for new loans and net charge-offs Slightly Increasing Customer-related fees excludes securities gains, dividends Slightly Increasing Excluding the larger contribution to the Company’s charitable foundation in 4Q17 of $12 million, FY18 adjusted NIE expected to increase slightly (low single digit rate of growth) Decreasing Excluding stock-based compensation1, the effective tax rate for FY18 is expected to be between 24% and 25% Expect preferred dividend to be $34 million in FY18 Diluted shares may experience some volatility due to the effect of outstanding warrants and the average price of ZION shares Customer-Related Fees Loan Balances Net Interest Income Loan Loss Provision Tax Rate Preferred Dividends & Diluted Shares Adjusted Noninterest Expense (1) ASU 2016-09 went into effect January 1, 2017 and now requires the difference between income tax accounting and U.S. GAAP accounting for stock compensation to be recognized in the income statement instead of a direct adjustment to equity.

 As of Date = 12/31/17, RBC values: 9/30/17 Sources: Total Risk Based Capital = SNL Financial/S&P Global, Bank Balance and Remaining Commitment = EDW. Notes: Peak energy not currently included in source document. Values are Committed Exposure as a percentage of Total Risk Based Capital (CE / TRBC); Committed Exposure = Bank Balance + Remaining Commitment * Credit Conversion Factor (100% for Construction, 0% for Bankcard, 100% for C&I and CRE, and 0% for Consumer (other than construction)). Multifamily does not include student and low income housing. Total A&D is all land-related construction. Acquisition (Land) is all CRE land held for development. The recent change to the structure of Category 1 and Category 2 limits is not reflected in the C&I limit graph. Committed Exposures and Limits Comments Committed Exposure and Limits – C&I Committed Exposure and Limits – CRE Risk Management: Concentration Risk Management Risk level reflects CRE asset class and Leveraged Lending exposures that are approaching or exceeding internal limits Combined affiliate CRE dollar limits at 90% of total capacity; Bancorp Construction and A&D at 80% of limit Office $72MM over limit as of 12/31/17; Multifamily with limited available capacity at $148MM Leverage/Enterprise dollar limits recently modified to allow any unused Category 1 (higher risk) capacity to be used by Category 2 (lower risk) exposure Low income housing tax credit (LIHTC) limits established; existing affiliate-level CRE, Construction/A&D dollar limits adjusted to allow additional LIHTC lending New limits framework in the process of being constructed with expected rollout in 2Q18  

 Risk Management: Credit Risk Enhancements Based upon “White Paper” process and governance, Zions implemented an adjustment to Investor CRE Adjusted concentration limits Adjusted underwriting to improve the quality of the Investor CRE loan portfolio by requiring: No multi-family (MF) loans rated with a Probability of Default rating of 8, 9 or 10 MF loans rated with a PD of 7 (approximately a BB rated credit) cannot have any underwriting policy exceptions All other CRE (outside of MF): Loans need to: Be rated a PD of 8 (approximately a BB- rated credit) or better Can not have a loan to value or debt service coverage exception Disciplined risk management practices led to deep-dive research in Investor “Term” CRE, followed by additional discipline 

 Risk Management: Relative Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Growth CRE concentration management has been a focus for Zions over the past several years Note: “CRE” includes term CRE, multifamily, and construction and land development loans. Growth indexed to 4Q11, when ZION instituted concentration limits. Data excludes peers that purchased significant companies during the time period, including BBT, HBAN, MTB, KEY Since concentration limits were put in place in December 2011, CRE at Zions has remained relatively flat Zions’ CRE portfolio growth is (intentionally) below the peer median in an effort to reduce the concentration Commercial Real Estate Growth Relative to Peers Indexed: 4Q11=100

Forward-looking statements reflect, among other things, our current expectations, all of which are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, market trends, industry results or regulatory outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “anticipates,” “believes,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plans,” “projects,” “should,” “would,” “targets,” “will” and the negative thereof and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about future financial and operating results, the potential timing or consummation of the proposed transaction described in the presentation and receipt of regulatory approvals or determinations, or the anticipated benefits thereof, including, without limitation, future financial and operating results. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those presented, either expressed or implied, in the presentation. Important risk factors that may cause such material differences include, but are not limited to, the rate of change of interest sensitive assets and liabilities relative to changes in benchmark interest rates; growth rates of revenue or expense; risks and uncertainties related to the ability to obtain shareholder and regulatory approvals or determinations for various matters, including the proposed merger of the holding company with and into the operating bank, or the possibility that such approvals or determinations may be delayed; the imposition by regulators of conditions or requirements that are not favorable to Zions; the ability of Zions Bancorporation to achieve anticipated benefits from the consolidation and regulatory determinations; and legislative, regulatory and economic developments that may diminish or eliminate the anticipated benefits of the consolidation. These risks, as well as other factors, are discussed in Zions Bancorporation’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and available at the SEC’s Internet site (http://www.sec.gov), and other risks associated with the proposed transaction will be more fully discussed in the proxy statement that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the proposed transaction. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: This document contains several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the “efficiency ratio,” which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. Certain of these non-GAAP measures are key inputs into Zions’ management compensation and are used in Zions’ strategic goals that have been and may continue to be articulated to investors. Therefore, the use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the document, and users of this document are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation.
