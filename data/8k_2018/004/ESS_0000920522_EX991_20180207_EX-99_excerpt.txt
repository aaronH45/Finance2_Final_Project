San Mateo, California—February 7, 2018—Essex Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE:ESS) announced today its fourth quarter 2017 earnings results and related business activities.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Highlights: 

  ·   Reported Net Income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $1.57, compared to $2.98 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease is primarily due to gains on sale of real estate that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016.     

  ·   Grew Core FFO per diluted share by 7.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and 7.9% for the full-year 2017.     

  ·   Achieved same-property gross revenue and net operating income (“NOI”) growth of 3.0% and 3.4%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full-year, achieved same-property gross revenue and NOI growth near the high-end of the guidance range of 3.7% and 4.2%.     

  ·   Sold two communities during the fourth quarter of 2017 for a total contract price of $160.3 million. For the full-year, the Company sold four communities for a total contract price of $375.8 million.     

  ·   Acquired one community during the fourth quarter of 2017 for a total contract price of $59.0 million. For the full-year, the Company acquired five communities for a total contract price of $566.8 million, near the high-end of the guidance range.     

  ·   Originated $64.5 million in three preferred equity developments during the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full-year, the Company committed $167.0 million in nine preferred equity and subordinated debt investments, exceeding the original guidance range for the year.     

“Essex delivered another year of solid growth in 2017 with Core FFO growth of 7.9%, which exceeded the high-end of our initial guidance range for the year. The Essex team responded skillfully to challenging market conditions by focusing on occupancy, other income, expense management and investment transactions. Looking forward to 2018, we expect demand for housing will outpace supply in our coastal markets of California and Washington which will lead to market rent growth near long-term averages. We believe the West Coast will continue to outperform the nation in both rent growth and job growth in 2018,” commented Michael Schall, President and CEO of the Company.

Investment Activity 

In October 2017, the Wesco I, LLC (“Wesco I”) joint venture operating agreement was amended to extend the venture. As part of the amendment, the Company and joint venture partner agreed that the Company earned a promote interest of $38.0 million. The Company agreed to contribute the earned promote interest to the joint venture, resulting in an increase in the Company’s ownership interest in Wesco I to approximately 58%. The promote income has been excluded from Net Income, Total FFO and Core FFO.  

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company formed a new joint venture entity, BEX III, LLC (“BEX III”), in which the Company has a 50% ownership interest. In November 2017, BEX III acquired The Village at Toluca Lake for a total contract price of $59.0 million. The community contains 145 apartment homes in Burbank, CA. The Village at Toluca Lake offers convenient access to employment opportunities in Burbank, Studio City, Glendale, and Hollywood. 

Dispositions 

In December 2017, the Company sold two communities, which were owned by BEXAEW, LLC, in which the Company has a 50% interest. The communities contained 587 apartment homes in Seattle, WA. The total contract price of the sales was $160.3 million. The Company’s share of the total gain on the sale was $34.8 million, which has been excluded from the calculation of Total FFO and Core FFO. 

Other Investments 

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company originated $64.5 million in three preferred equity investments in multifamily developments located in Los Angeles, CA, San Diego, CA, and Bellevue, WA. The total investment has an average preferred return of 11.1% and all of the investments mature in 2021. 

Development Activity 

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company began construction on a new development in Hollywood, CA. The project is estimated to have 200 apartment homes and up to 4,700 square feet of ground-floor retail space. The community is centrally located in the heart of Hollywood and less than a quarter mile from the Hollywood/Vine Metro Station, which provides convenient access to Downtown Los Angeles. The development is expected to cost approximately $105.0 million and open in the first quarter of 2020.

Funds from Operations (“FFO”) Reconciliation 

FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), is generally considered by industry analysts as an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT. Generally, FFO adjusts the net income of equity REITs for non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization of rental properties, impairment charges, gains on sales of real estate and extraordinary items. Management considers FFO and FFO which excludes merger, integration and acquisition costs and items that are not routine or not related to the Company’s core business activities, which is referred to as “Core FFO”, to be useful financial performance measures of an equity REIT because, together with net income and cash flows, FFO and Core FFO provide investors with additional bases to evaluate the operating performance and ability of a REIT to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures and the ability to pay dividends. 

FFO and Core FFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and are not intended to indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the REIT’s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. FFO and Core FFO do not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs including principal amortization, capital improvements and distributions to stockholders. FFO and Core FFO also do not represent cash flows generated from operating, investing or financing activities as defined under GAAP. Management has consistently applied the NAREIT definition of FFO to all periods presented. However, there is judgment involved and other REITs’ calculation of FFO may vary from the NAREIT definition for this measure, and thus their disclosures of FFO may not be comparable to the Company’s calculation.  

The following table sets forth the Company’s calculation of diluted FFO and Core FFO for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except for share and per share amounts): 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Interest rate swaps are generally adjusted to fair value through other comprehensive income (loss). However, because certain of our interest rate swaps do not have a 0% LIBOR floor, while related hedged debt in these cases is subject to a 0% LIBOR floor, the portion of the change in fair value of these interest rate swaps attributable to this mismatch is recorded as noncash interest rate hedge ineffectiveness through interest expense.   

 (2) Assumes conversion of all outstanding limited partnership units in Essex Portfolio, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) into shares of the Company’s common stock and excludes all DownREIT limited partnership units for which the Operating Partnership has the ability and intention to redeem the units for cash and does not consider them to be common stock equivalents.

Net Operating Income (“NOI”) and Same-Property NOI Reconciliations 

Net Operating Income (“NOI”) and Same-Property NOI are considered by management to be important supplemental performance measures to earnings from operations included in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of income. The presentation of same-property NOI assists with the presentation of the Company’s operations prior to the allocation of depreciation and any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual communities or groups of communities. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. The Company defines same-property NOI as same-property revenue less same-property operating expenses, including property taxes. Please see the reconciliation of earnings from operations to NOI and same-property NOI, which in the table below is the NOI for stabilized properties consolidated by the Company for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms  

Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation  

Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is a component of the credit ratio, “Net Indebtedness Divided by Adjusted EBITDA”, presented on page S-6, in the section titled “Selected Credit Ratios”, and it is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as income tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and other fixed charges. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  

The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income available to common stockholders is presented in the table below (Dollars in thousands):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)  Internet expense, net includes items such as gains on derivatives and the amortization of deferred charges.   

Encumbered  

Encumbered means any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, charge, pledge, security interest, security agreement or other encumbrance of any kind.  

Funds From Operations (“FFO”)  

FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), is generally considered by industry analysts as an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT. Generally, FFO adjusts the net income of equity REITs for non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization of rental properties, impairment charges, gains on sales of real estate and extraordinary items. Management considers FFO and FFO which excludes merger, integration and acquisition costs and items that are not routine or not related to the Company’s core business activities, which is referred to as “Core FFO”, to be useful financial performance measures of an equity REIT because, together with net income and cash flows, FFO and Core FFO provide investors with additional bases to evaluate the operating performance and ability of a REIT to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures and the ability to pay dividends.

Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms  

Funds From Operations (“FFO”) - continued 

FFO and Core FFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by U.S. GAAP and are not intended to indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the REIT’s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. FFO and Core FFO do not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs including principal amortization, capital improvements and distributions to shareholders. FFO and Core FFO do not represent cash flows generated from operating, investing or financing activities as defined under U.S. GAAP. Management has consistently applied the NAREIT definition of FFO to all periods presented. However, there is judgment involved and other REITs’ calculation of FFO may vary from the NAREIT definition for this measure, and thus their disclosures of FFO may not be comparable to the Company’s calculation. 

The reconciliations of diluted FFO and Core FFO are detailed on page S-3 in the section titled “Consolidated Funds From Operations”. 

Interest Expense, Net 

Interest expense, net is presented on page S-1 in the section titled “Consolidated Operating Results”. Interest expense, net includes items such as gains on derivatives and the amortization of deferred charges and is presented in the table below (Dollars in thousands):

  Net Indebtedness Divided by Adjusted EBITDA 

This credit ratio is presented on page S-6 in the section titled “Selected Credit Ratios”. This credit ratio is calculated by dividing net indebtedness by Adjusted EBITDA, as annualized based on the most recent quarter, and adjusted for estimated net operating income from properties acquired or disposed of during the quarter. This ratio is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing the Company’s ability to service debt obligations to that of other companies. Net indebtedness is total debt, net less unamortized premiums, discounts, debt issuance costs, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA is set forth in “Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation” on page S-17.1 The calculation of this credit ratio and a reconciliation of net indebtedness to total debt, net is presented in the table below (Dollars in thousands):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Operating Income (“NOI”) and Same-Property NOI Reconciliations 

  Net Operating Income (“NOI”) and same-property NOI are considered by management to be important supplemental performance measures to earnings from operations included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. The presentation of same-property NOI assists with the presentation of the Company’s operations prior to the allocation of depreciation and any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual communities or groups of communities. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. The Company defines same-property NOI as same-property revenue less same-property operating expenses, including property taxes. Please see the reconciliation of earnings from operations to NOI and same-property NOI, which in the table below is the NOI for stabilized properties consolidated by the Company for the periods presented (Dollars in thousands): 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Public Bond Covenants 

  Public Bond Covenants refer to certain covenants set forth in instruments governing the Company’s unsecured indebtedness. These instruments require the Company to meet specified financial covenants, including covenants relating to net worth, fixed charge coverage, debt service coverage, the amounts of total indebtedness and secured indebtedness, leverage and certain investment limitations. These covenants may restrict the Company’s ability to expand or fully pursue its business strategies. The Company’s ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by changes in the Company’s operating and financial performance, changes in general business and economic conditions, adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting it. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Company’s indebtedness, which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable. If any of the Company’s indebtedness is accelerated, it may not be able to repay it. For risks related to failure to comply with these covenants, see “Item 1A: Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financings” in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and other reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). 

  The ratios set forth on page S-6 in the section titled “Public Bond Covenants” are provided only to show the Company’s compliance with certain specified covenants that are contained in indentures related to the Company’s issuance of Senior Notes, which indentures are filed by the Company with the SEC. See, for example, the Indenture dated April 10, 2017, filed by the Company as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company’s Form 8-K, filed on April 10, 2017. These ratios should not be used for any other purpose, including without limitation to evaluate the Company’s financial condition or results of operations, nor do they indicate the Company’s covenant compliance as of any other date or for any other period. The capitalized terms in the disclosure are defined in the indentures filed by the Company with the SEC and may differ materially from similar terms used by other companies that present information about their covenant compliance. 

  Secured Debt 

  Secured Debt means debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries which is secured by an encumbrance on any property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Company’s total amount of Secured Debt is set forth on page S-5.

  Unencumbered NOI to Adjusted Total NOI 

  This ratio is presented on page S-6 in the section titled “Selected Credit Ratios”. Unencumbered NOI means the sum of NOI for those real estate assets which are not subject to an encumbrance securing debt. The ratio of Unencumbered NOI to Adjusted Total NOI for the three months ended December 31, 2017, annualized, is calculated by dividing Unencumbered NOI, annualized for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and as further adjusted for pro forma NOI for properties acquired or sold during the recent quarter, by Adjusted Total NOI as annualized. The calculation and reconciliation of NOI is set forth in “Net Operating Income (“NOI”) and Same-Property NOI Reconciliation” above. This ratio is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing the Company’s ability to service debt obligations to that of other companies. The calculation of this ratio is presented in the table below (Dollars in thousands):
