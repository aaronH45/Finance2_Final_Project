FARMINGTON, Conn., Jan. 24, 2018 - United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 results above expectations and expects continued growth in 2018. In a conference call with investors and analysts today, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes will discuss the 2017 results and the company’s expectations for 2018.

“UTC had a strong finish to 2017,” said Hayes. “Sales, adjusted EPS and free cash flow were all above the top end of our expectations. Our focus on innovation, execution and cost reduction led to our best year of organic sales growth since 2014, with all businesses contributing. We gained share in our commercial businesses and continued to execute on our growing aerospace backlog. UTC also announced the transformative Rockwell Collins acquisition which will create a premier aerospace supplier. As a result of this proposed transaction, together with the investments in our businesses and in our digital strategies, we are positioned well for years to come.” 

Hayes continued, “In 2018, we expect accelerating organic sales and adjusted earnings per share growth along with strong cash generation.” 

Fourth Quarter 2017

Fourth quarter sales of $15.7 billion were up 7 percent over the prior year including 5 points of organic sales growth and 2 points of foreign exchange. 

GAAP EPS was $0.50 (down from $1.26 in the fourth quarter of 2016) and included 90 cents for a charge related to tax law changes and 20 cents of net restructuring and other significant items. Associated with the tax law change is an estimated, cumulative net cash payment of $1.5 billion to be paid through 2026. Adjusted EPS of $1.60 was up 3 percent versus the prior year.

Each of United Technologies’ businesses grew sales in the fourth quarter. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 25 percent at Pratt & Whitney, and up 10 percent at UTC Aerospace Systems. Otis new equipment orders increased 1 percent versus the prior year at constant currency, with solid growth in the U.S. and Europe and continued pricing pressure in China. Equipment orders at UTC Climate, Controls & Security increased 9 percent organically.

Full Year 2017 

Full year sales of $59.8 billion were up 5 percent versus the prior year with 4 points of organic sales growth and 1 point of net acquisitions impact. 

Full year 2017 GAAP EPS of $5.70 was down 7 percent versus prior year. 2017 results included 90 cents for the fourth quarter tax charge and 5 cents of net restructuring and other significant items, as compared with 48 cents in 2016. Adjusted EPS of $6.65 increased 1 percent year over year. Net income for the year was $4.6 billion, down 10 percent versus the prior year. Cash flow from operations for the year was $5.6 billion and capital expenditures were $2.0 billion. 

In 2017, United Technologies invested in digital initiatives to drive operational efficiency and generate long-term value for its customers. Investments included the United Technologies Digital Accelerator, new digital solutions within UTC Climate, Controls & Security, and new tools for more than 15,000 Otis technicians worldwide. Pratt & Whitney’s Geared Turbofan™ Engine was selected to power Delta Air Lines’ order of 100 A321neo aircraft. Additionally, the proposed acquisition of Rockwell Collins, announced in 2017, will lead to a new era of innovative aerospace products and solutions for UTC’s customers. 

Outlook for 2018

UTC provides the following 2018 outlook (excluding the impact of the proposed Rockwell Collins acquisition):

•Adjusted EPS of $6.85 to $7.10*;

•Total sales of $62.5 to $64.0 billion, including organic sales growth of 4 to 6 percent*;

•Free cash flow in the range of $4.5 to $5.0 billion.* 

“Our outlook demonstrates how our strategic investments are paying off,” said Hayes. “We are innovating for growth and expect all of our businesses to grow sales and earnings in 2018.”

*Note: When we provide expectations for adjusted EPS, organic sales and free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures generally is not available without unreasonable effort. See “Use and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information.

Use and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

United Technologies Corporation reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under GAAP with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP information presented provides investors with additional useful information, but should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the related GAAP measures. Moreover, other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently, which limits the usefulness of these measures for comparisons with such other companies. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

Adjusted net sales, organic sales, adjusted operating profit, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted net sales represents consolidated net sales from continuing operations (a GAAP measure), excluding significant items of a non-recurring and/or nonoperational nature (hereinafter referred to as “other significant items”). Organic sales represents consolidated net sales (a GAAP measure), excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures completed in the preceding twelve months and other significant items. Adjusted operating profit represents income from continuing operations (a GAAP measure), excluding restructuring costs and other significant items. Adjusted net income represents net income from continuing operations (a GAAP measure), excluding restructuring costs and other significant items. Adjusted EPS represents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (a GAAP measure), excluding restructuring costs and other significant items. For the business segments, when applicable, adjustments of net sales, operating profit and margins similarly reflect continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other significant items. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures just mentioned are useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of the Company’s ongoing operational performance. 

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents cash flow from operations (a GAAP measure) less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity and an additional basis for assessing UTC's ability to fund its activities, including the financing of acquisitions, debt service, repurchases of UTC's common stock and distribution of earnings to shareholders.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding amounts prepared in accordance with GAAP appears in the tables in this press release. The tables provide additional information as to the items and amounts that have been excluded from the adjusted measures. 

When we provide our expectation for adjusted EPS, adjusted operating profit, organic sales and free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures (expected diluted EPS from continuing operations, operating profit, sales and expected cash flow from operations) generally is not available without unreasonable effort due to potentially high variability, complexity and low visibility as to the items that would be excluded from the GAAP measure in the relevant future period, such as unusual gains and losses, the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact and timing of potential acquisitions and divestitures, and other structural changes or their probable significance. The variability of the excluded items may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP results.
