FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2017

Marlborough, Mass. (February 1, 2018) -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) generated sales of $2.408 billion during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. This represents growth of 9.9 percent on a reported basis and 8.1 percent on an operational basis (excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates), all compared to the prior year period. The company reported a GAAP loss of $615 million or ($0.45) per share, primarily related to its estimate1 of a one-time net income tax charge resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), compared to GAAP earnings of $124 million or $0.09 per share a year ago, and achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.34 for the period, compared to $0.30 a year ago.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the company achieved full year sales of $9.048 billion, representing 7.9 percent revenue growth on a reported basis and 7.8 percent on an operational basis. The company reported GAAP earnings of $0.08 per share, compared to $0.25 in the prior year period and delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, compared to $1.11 in 2016.

“Our team delivered excellent fourth quarter and full year results, fueled by the strength of our diversified portfolio and global commercial execution,” said Mike Mahoney, chairman and chief executive officer, Boston Scientific. “We look forward to building on our momentum and continuing to make a meaningful difference for patients in 2018.”

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income (earnings) and adjusted net income (earnings) per share that exclude certain amounts, operational net sales, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic net sales, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of recent acquisitions with significant sales. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

To calculate adjusted net income (earnings) and adjusted net income (earnings) per share we exclude certain charges (credits) from GAAP net income, including amortization expense, intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related net charges (credits), restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits), litigation-related net charges (credits), certain investment impairment charges and the estimated one-time net income tax charge resulting from the enactment of the TCJA in December 2017. Please refer to Part I, Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our most recent Quarterly Report filed on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our most recent Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for an explanation of each of these adjustments and the reasons for excluding each item. An explanation of adjustments not previously described in the aforementioned filings are included below:

•TCJA net charge - These items represent adjustments of certain tax positions as a results of the TCJA, enacted in December 2017. These adjustments, which are estimates, are not indicative of expected on-going operating results. We exclude the impact of this charge from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for the purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.

The GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income and GAAP net income per share. 

To calculate operational net sales, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period. To calculate organic net sales, we remove the impact of recent acquisitions with significant sales from operational net sales. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to operational net sales and organic net sales growth rate percentages is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis. 

Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the accompanying schedules.

Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management 

uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. With the exception of the impact of recent acquisitions with significant sales, the adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments’ measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.

We believe that presenting adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share, operational net sales and organic net sales, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.
