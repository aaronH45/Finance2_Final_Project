The foreign currency exchange impact on net sales in the fourth quarter was positive of approximately 1.2% and nominal in the full year.

"I would like to thank our teams for delivering these results, which were well balanced across businesses and geographies. We are also driving innovation through R&D and acquisitions that will fuel future growth. These investments will enable us to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech and leveraged earning gains.”

(a) NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage sales growth in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions; and adjusted net earnings per diluted share. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. 

To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and such year’s acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency and excluding the impact of acquisitions is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of such year’s acquisitions. 

Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of our expected net earnings per diluted share to expected adjusted net earnings per diluted share without unreasonable efforts due to the inherent difficulty in predicting or estimating the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on our GAAP earnings. Such impact potentially could be significant.
