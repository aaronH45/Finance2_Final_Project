This Current Report on Form 8-K (“Current Report”) is being filed by Tapestry, Inc. ("Tapestry" or the "Company") to retrospectively adjust certain financial information and related disclosures contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2017, filed on August 18, 2017 (“2017 Form 10-K”), as described below, and for the purpose of incorporating by reference the exhibits filed herewith into its registration statements.

Change in Segment Reporting 

As we disclosed in our 2017 Form 10-K, during fiscal 2018, the Company realigned its reportable segments with the new structure of its business following the acquisition of Kate Spade & Company ("Kate Spade"). As a result of this realignment, the Company now has three reportable segments: Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. The Company's former North America and International segments have been consolidated within the new Coach segment. 

To reflect the change in segments, the following Items of the 2017 Form 10-K have been adjusted retrospectively (which Items, as revised, are filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference):

•Part I, Item 1. Business

•Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

•Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

This Current Report does not reflect events that may have occurred subsequent to the original filing date of the 2017 Form 10-K, and does not modify or update in any way the disclosures made in the 2017 Form 10-K other than as required to retrospectively reflect the change in segment reporting, as described above. All other information in the 2017 Form 10-K remains unchanged. Without limitation of the foregoing, this filing does not purport to update the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information known to management subsequent to the date of filing of the 2017 Form 10-K. The information in this Current Report should be read in conjunction with the 2017 Form 10-K. For information on developments since the filing of the 2017 Form 10-K, please refer to the Company’s subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
