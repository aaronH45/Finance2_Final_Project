 Item 8.01. Other Events.  

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. The Tax Act is one of the most comprehensive changes in the U.S. corporate income tax since 1986 and certain provisions are highly complex in their application. The Tax Act revises the U.S. Corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, adopting a territorial income tax system, and imposing a toll charge on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We are currently evaluating the impact that the Tax Act will have on both our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Operations. At this time, based on information currently available, we anticipate that our results for the fourth quarter of 2017 will reflect a charge in the approximate range of $450-$500 million. This charge represents the impact of the Tax Act on the consolidated results of Leucadia, including the portion related to Jefferies. Because Jefferies fiscal year ends on November 30th, the impact of the Tax Act on their separately filed financial statements will be reflected in their first quarter results ending February 28, 2018. The charge consists of both the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and a toll charge of about $30 million on the deemed repatriation of net unremitted foreign earnings relating to Jefferies and Linkem. As previously stated, the decrease in the carrying value of Leucadia’s deferred tax asset, in addition to being non-cash, has no meaningful economic significance because it does not alter the amount of future taxable income that will be sheltered.  

The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from this estimate, possibly materially, due to changes in interpretations and assumptions, and guidance that may be issued and actions we may take in response to the Tax Act. We note that the Tax Act is highly complex and we continue to assess the impact that various provisions will have on our business.
