 The difference between the Company’s full-year 2017 FFO as Adjusted of $1.87 per share and the $1.93 midpoint of its full-year 2018 FFO as Adjusted guidance range is primarily due to:

   ·    A negative impact of approximately $0.01 from higher LIBOR and other non-core items;  

   ·    A neutral impact from development and Developer Capital Program investments after accounting for costs to fund; and 

   ·    Flat general and administrative expense year-over-year.
