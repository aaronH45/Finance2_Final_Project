“We are pleased with our 2017 performance, which is the result of improved execution in all areas of our business and an increased focus on aligning strategic investments and capabilities to more effectively meet the changing needs of the more than forty million consumers we are privileged to serve,” said Gail K.

The company expects its full year 2018 net income to be greater than $14.28 per share, including approximately $0.72 per share of net negative adjustment items.

CONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS  

Membership: Medical enrollment totaled approximately 40.2 million members at December 31, 2017, an increase of 325 thousand members, or 0.8% percent, from 39.9 million at December 31, 2016. Commercial & Specialty Business enrollment increased by 278 thousand medical members as the Company experienced growth in both self-funded and fully-insured Local Group businesses, partially offset by a decline in membership in the National and Individual businesses. Enrollment also grew by 47 thousand in the Government business as growth in Medicare was partially offset by a decline in Medicaid enrollment.  

Medical enrollment declined by 13 thousand lives sequentially during the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease reflected enrollment declines in the Individual business, partially offset by growth in the Medicare, Medicaid, and Local Group self-funded businesses.  

Operating Revenue: Operating revenue was $22.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 4.5 percent, versus the $21.5 billion in the prior year quarter. The growth in revenue reflected premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends across our business. Additionally, the increase was driven by higher enrollment in Medicare and both Local Group insured and self-funded businesses. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017.  

Benefit Expense Ratio: The benefit expense ratio was 88.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 140 basis points from 87.2 percent in the prior year quarter. The increase, as expected, was largely driven by the impact of the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. The increase was partially offset by improved medical cost performance in the Individual and Local Group businesses.  

Medical claims reserves established at December 31, 2016 developed better than the Company’s expectation during 2017.  

Medical Cost Trend: For the full year 2017, underlying Local Group medical cost trend was approximately 6.5%. The Company is updating the reporting of its underlying Local Group medical cost trend in 2018 to reflect the “allowed amount”, or contractual rate, paid to care providers. The previous methodology was based on the “paid amount”, which is the “allowed amount” less copays and deductibles. As a result, the company anticipates Local Group medical cost trend will be in the range of 6.0% +/- 50 basis points in 2018. If 2017 was calculated on a consistent basis with the updated methodology in 2018, Local Group medical cost trends would have been approximately 5.5%.  

Days in Claims Payable: Days in Claims Payable (“DCP”) was 39.4 days as of December 31, 2017, a decrease of 1.1 days from 40.5 days as of September 30, 2017.  

SG&A Expense Ratio: The SG&A expense ratio was 15.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 10 basis points from 15.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease, as expected, was primarily driven by the impact of the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and the impact of fixed cost leverage on operating revenue growth. These items were partially offset by the impact of increased investment spend to support growth initiatives and an increase in incentive compensation expense.  

Operating Cash Flow: Operating cash outflow was $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, bringing full year 2017 operating cash flow to $4.2 billion, or 1.1 times net income.  

2  

Share Repurchase Program: During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 1.8 million shares of its common stock for $362 million, or a weighted-average price of $205.41. During the full year 2017, the Company repurchased 10.5 million shares of its common stock for $2.0 billion, or a weighted average price of $189.93. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $7.2 billion of Board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining.  

Cash Dividend: During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $179.5 million.  

On January 30, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2018 dividend to shareholders of $0.75 per share. On an annualized basis, this equates to a dividend of $3.00 per share. The first quarter dividend is payable on March 23, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 9, 2018.  

Investment Portfolio & Capital Position: During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded net realized gains on financial instruments totaling $6.6 million and other-than-temporary impairment losses totaling $12.2 million. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded net realized gains of $28.7 million and other-than-temporary impairment losses totaling $11.8 million.  

As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s net unrealized gain position in the investment portfolio was $834.8 million, consisting of net unrealized gains on equity and fixed maturity securities totaling $507.2 and $327.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $2.8 billion, including the timing impact of inter-company funding arrangements in the quarter. Adjusted for the timing impact of these arrangements, which was resolved in early 2018, cash and investments at the parent company would have totaled approximately $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2017.  

Income Tax Expense: During the fourth quarter, the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash deferred tax benefit from corporate tax reform of $1.1 billion, reducing the total income tax expense in 2017 to $121 million, an effective tax rate of 3.1%.

The decrease was driven by increased investment spend to support growth initiatives and the impact of the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. The decrease was partially offset by improved medical cost performance in the Individual and Local Group businesses.  

Government Business: Operating gain in the Government Business segment was $360.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $169.1 million, or 31.9 percent, from $529.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease reflects increased investment spend to support growth initiatives and the impact of the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. These decreases were partially offset by improved medical cost performance in the Medicaid business.  

Other: The Company reported an operating loss of $51.0 million in the Other segment for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with an operating loss of $66.1 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by lower terminated Cigna acquisition related expenses.

Basis of Presentation  

 1. Operating revenue and operating gain are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reporting segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense and selling, general and administrative expense. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains/losses on financial instruments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management (refer to page 14 for the GAAP reconciliation tables).  

 2. Operating margin is defined as operating gain divided by operating revenue.
