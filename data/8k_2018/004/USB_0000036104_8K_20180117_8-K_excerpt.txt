Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

On January 17, 2018, U.S. Bancorp (the “Company”) issued a press release reporting quarter-ended December 31, 2017 results, and posted on its website its 4Q17 Earnings Conference Call Presentation, which contains certain additional historical and forward-looking information relating to the Company. The press release is included as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The information included in the press release is considered to be “filed” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The 4Q17 Earnings Conference Call Presentation is included as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The information included in the 4Q17 Earnings Conference Call Presentation is considered to be “furnished” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  

As previously disclosed, the Company is working to resolve matters with regulatory agencies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, relating to their review of the legacy Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering compliance program of U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”). Resolution of these regulatory matters is expected to include payment of civil money penalties. Also as disclosed, a legacy banking relationship between U.S. Bank and payday lending businesses associated with former customer Scott Tucker (who was convicted of fraud charges on October 13, 2017) has been the subject of an investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan. That investigation also has covered issues related to the adequacy and effectiveness of U.S. Bank’s legacy Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering compliance program. The parties are currently working on a definitive settlement, which the Company currently expects to include a deferred prosecution agreement and payment of a penalty, which the Company expects to finalize soon. Based on the current status of these various matters, the Company has accrued a liability of $608 million, which is reflected in the Company’s financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The settlement of these matters is subject to negotiation and completion of final documentation and approval by the Company and the relevant agencies, and therefore the final terms of the settlements may differ from the Company’s current expectations. In addition, as previously disclosed, the Company remains subject to other ongoing examinations, inquiries and investigations by government agencies and bank regulators, including a review by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of economic sanctions and related compliance matters, any of which could result in administrative proceedings, monetary fines or other penalties.
