        " $43 million (6.0 percent) due to a $28 million (6.3 percent) increase in net interest income and a $15 million (5.7 percent) increase in total noninterest income. Net interest income increased year-over-year principally due to growth in the investment portfolio. Total noninterest income increased year-over-year primarily due to lower loan-related charges. Total noninterest expense increased $894 million over the fourth quarter of 2016 principally due to the impacts of the notable items including a special bonus to eligible employees, a charitable contribution to the U.S. Bank foundation and a regulatory and legal accrual. The provision for credit losses decreased by $26 million primarily due to lower net charge-offs reflecting higher recoveries in the current quarter. Income tax expense decreased by $956 million primarily due to the impacts of tax reform on the Companyâ€™s tax related assets and liabilities."
