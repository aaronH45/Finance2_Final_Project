Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In this earnings release, the company supplements its reporting of information determined in accordance with GAAP, such as revenue, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, earnings per share from continuing operations and net cash provided by operating activities, with "adjusted revenue," "internal revenue growth," "adjusted operating income," "adjusted operating margin," "adjusted net income," "adjusted earnings per share," "adjusted earnings per share, excluding the Lending Transaction" and "free cash flow." Management believes that adjustments for certain non-cash or other items and the exclusion of certain pass-through revenue and expenses should enhance shareholders' ability to evaluate the company's performance, as such measures provide additional insights into the factors and

trends affecting its business. Therefore, the company excludes these items from GAAP revenue, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, earnings per share from continuing operations and net cash provided by operating activities to calculate these non-GAAP measures. The corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this earnings release, except for forward-looking measures where a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the non-cash and other items described below that are excluded from the non-GAAP outlook measures. See page 12 for additional information regarding the company's forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.

Examples of non-cash or other items may include, but are not limited to, non-cash deferred revenue adjustments arising from acquisitions, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, non-cash impairment charges, gains or losses from dispositions and unconsolidated affiliates, severance costs, merger and integration costs, certain costs associated with the achievement of the company's operational effectiveness objectives, and certain discrete tax benefits. The company excludes these items to more clearly focus on the factors management believes are pertinent to its operations, and management uses this information to make operating decisions, including the allocation of resources to the company's various businesses.

Internal revenue growth and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and are described on page 11. Management believes internal revenue growth is useful because it presents revenue growth excluding acquisitions, dispositions and the impact of postage reimbursements in the company's Output Solutions business, and including deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. Management believes free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions. Management believes this supplemental information enhances shareholders' ability to evaluate and understand the company's core business performance.

These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenue, operating income, operating margin, income from continuing operations, earnings per share from continuing operations and net cash provided by operating activities or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Internal Revenue Growth - The company's internal revenue growth outlook for 2018 excludes acquisitions, dispositions, including the Lending Transaction, and the impact of postage reimbursements in its Output Solutions business, and includes deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. These adjustments are subject to variability and are anticipated to lower 2018 GAAP revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points as compared to the internal revenue growth rate.

Adjusted Earnings Per Share - The company's adjusted earnings per share outlook for 2018 excludes certain non-cash or other items which should enhance shareholders' ability to evaluate the company's performance, as such measures provide additional insights into the factors and trends affecting its business. Non-cash or other items may be significant and include, but are not limited to, non-cash deferred revenue adjustments arising from acquisitions, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions, non-cash impairment charges, gains or losses from dispositions and unconsolidated affiliates, severance costs, merger and integration costs, certain costs associated with the achievement of the company's operational effectiveness objectives, and certain discrete tax benefits. The company estimates that the amortization expense with respect to acquired intangible assets as of December 31, 2017 will be approximately $160 million in 2018. Other adjustments to earnings per share that have been incurred in 2017 are presented on page 7. Estimates of these other adjustments on a forward-looking basis are not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of these items.

The following table presents 2017 results excluding the company's sale of a 55 percent interest of its Lending Solutions business which is targeted to close in the first quarter of 2018.
