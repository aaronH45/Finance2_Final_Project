Item 3.03 Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders

On February 7, 2018, Accenture plc (“Accenture”) held its 2018 annual general meeting of shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”). At the Annual Meeting, Accenture’s shareholders approved an amendment to Accenture’s Articles of Association, which became effective February 7, 2018. Consistent with Irish law, the amendment permits Accenture to engage in certain transactions with its subsidiaries and affiliates, such as a merger, amalgamation or sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of its assets, without obtaining shareholder approval. 

The amendment to Accenture’s Articles of Association is described in Accenture’s definitive proxy statement for the Annual Meeting filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 15, 2017 (the “Proxy Statement”), and the description of the amendment included in the Proxy Statement is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 99.1. The description of the amendment to Accenture’s Articles of Association is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto. 

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

At the Annual Meeting, Accenture’s shareholders approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Share Incentive Plan (as amended, the “Amended 2010 SIP”), which had previously been approved by the Board of Directors of Accenture (the “Board”), subject to shareholder approval.

The Amended 2010 SIP is substantially the same as the prior Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Share Incentive Plan, except that it has been amended to authorize an additional 16 million shares. 

The material terms of the Amended 2010 SIP are described in the Proxy Statement, and the description of the plan included in the Proxy Statement is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 99.2. The description of the Amended 2010 SIP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended 2010 SIP, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.

Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
