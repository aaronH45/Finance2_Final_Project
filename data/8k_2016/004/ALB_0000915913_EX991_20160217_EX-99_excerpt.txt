[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See accompanying notes (a) through (d) to the condensed consolidated financial information and non-GAAP reconciliations.

Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) reported fourth quarter 2015 earnings of $174.3 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, compared to a fourth quarter 2014 loss of ($18.5) million, or ($0.24) per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2015 includes an income tax benefit of $0.40 per diluted share primarily related to the release of certain tax reserves associated with lapses in statutes of limitations and audit closures, and a mark-to-market (“MTM”) actuarial gain of $0.25 per diluted share mainly resulting from a higher discount rate and updated mortality assumptions included in the annual remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans. Fourth quarter 2014 included a MTM actuarial loss of $0.91 per diluted share, which reflected actuarial assumptions at the time of the remeasurement. Fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings were $116.2 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to $77.4 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2014 (see notes to the condensed consolidated financial information). The Company reported net sales of $930.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up from net sales of $598.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, driven primarily by the acquisition of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (“Rockwood”), which closed January 12, 2015, partly offset by the impact of lower sales volumes, unfavorable price and mix impacts in some businesses and unfavorable currency exchange impacts.

Earnings for the full year 2015 were $334.9 million, or $3.00 per diluted share, compared to $133.3 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, for the full year 2014. Adjusted earnings for the full year 2015 (including $52.4 million in non-cash currency exchange transaction gains from the first quarter) were $439.4 million, or $3.94 per diluted 

1

share, compared to $332.1 million, or $4.20 per diluted share, for the full year 2014. Net sales for the full year 2015 were $3.65 billion, up from net sales of $2.45 billion, driven primarily by the acquisition of Rockwood, partly offset by the impact of lower sales volumes, unfavorable price and mix impacts in certain businesses and unfavorable currency exchange impacts.

“In 2015, we began the transformation of Albemarle with the acquisition of Rockwood and delivered on our commitments to our shareholders,” said Luke Kissam, president and CEO. “The lithium and surface treatment businesses we acquired in January exceeded profitability expectations for the year, resulting in adjusted EBITDA for the company of $959 million and 6% growth over 2014. Cash generation was as expected, and the $60 million of synergies achieved exceeded our goal at the beginning of the year. We completed the sale of two non-core businesses and used the proceeds to pay down debt by over $300 million in early 2016. We achieved our goals for 2015 and are well positioned to grow in 2016. Our goals for 2016 are clear: deliver the forecasted free cash flow to enable further deleveraging, continue to drive synergy savings and convert the recently announced memorandum of understanding related to our lithium concession in Chile to a definitive agreement.”

The acquisition of Rockwood was completed on January 12, 2015 for a purchase price of approximately $5.7 billion. The cash consideration was funded with proceeds from senior notes the Company issued in 2014 and borrowings under the Company’s term loan credit agreement, cash bridge facility and revolving credit agreement. The results of Rockwood from January 1, 2015 to January 12, 2015 (“stub period”) are excluded from the year-to-date financial results presented herein. Excluded net sales and adjusted EBITDA for the stub period were $33.2 million and $3.4 million, respectively.

Quarterly Segment Results

In order to provide a meaningful comparison of the results of operations, where applicable, segment results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 are compared to pro forma segment results for the comparative periods of 2014. The 2014 pro forma segment results are based on the historical combined consolidated financial statements of Albemarle and Rockwood and were prepared to illustrate the effects of the integration of the Rockwood business, as well as the first quarter 2015 change in reporting structure. This supplemental pro forma financial information is also located on Albemarle’s website and in Albemarle’s Current Report on Form 8-K which was filed on April 13, 2015.

Performance Chemicals reported net sales of $385.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 1.2% from fourth quarter 2014 pro forma net sales of $390.0 million. Net sales were impacted by $10.8 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts as compared to the prior year. Higher Lithium sales volumes and favorable pricing in Bromine and Lithium were partially offset by lower Bromine sales volumes, which, in total, offset $6.3 million of the unfavorable impacts of currency exchange. Adjusted EBITDA for Performance Chemicals was $120.1 million, a decrease of 2.8% from fourth quarter 2014 pro forma results of $123.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by $2.2 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts as compared to the prior year. The remaining $1.3 million decrease in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by lower Bromine sales volumes and lower equity income from our Lithium joint venture, Talison, partially offset by higher Lithium sales volumes and favorable Bromine and Lithium pricing.

Refining Solutions generated net sales of $200.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 14.2% from net sales of $233.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales were impacted by $5.1 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts as compared to the prior year. The remaining $28.0 million decrease in net sales was primarily driven by unfavorable Clean Fuels Technology volumes and price partly offset by favorable Heavy Oil Upgrading volumes. Adjusted EBITDA for Refining Solutions was $52.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 21.6% from fourth quarter 2014 results of $67.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by $1.0 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts as compared to the prior year. The remaining $13.5 million decrease in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower Clean Fuels Technology sales volumes and price partly offset by favorable Heavy Oil Upgrading volumes.

Chemetall® Surface Treatment reported net sales of $207.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 2.9% from fourth quarter 2014 pro forma net sales of $201.9 million. Net sales were impacted by $21.4 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts as compared to the prior year. The remaining $27.2 million increase in net sales was primarily due to increased sales volumes related to the acquisition of the remaining shares of the Chemetall Shanghai joint venture in February of this year and favorable pricing. Adjusted EBITDA for Chemetall Surface Treatment was $53.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 13.5% from fourth quarter 2014 pro forma results of $47.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by $5.8 million of unfavorable currency 

2

exchange impacts as compared to the prior year. The remaining $12.2 million increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher overall sales volumes and favorable pricing offset slightly by increased selling, general and administrative expenses primarily associated with the Chemetall Shanghai joint venture acquisition.

All Other net sales were $133.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 8.1% from pro forma net sales of $123.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales were impacted by $7.9 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts as compared to the prior year. The remaining $17.8 million increase in net sales was primarily due to increased Fine Chemistry Services volumes due to timing of projects and pricing. All Other adjusted EBITDA was $24.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 66.0% from fourth quarter 2014 pro forma results of $14.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by $1.0 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts as compared to the prior year. The remaining $10.8 million increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher Fine Chemistry Services sales volumes and pricing.

In summary, total net sales of $930.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $19.9 million or 2.1% from fourth quarter 2014 pro forma net sales of $950.3 million, was unfavorably impacted by currency exchange of $45.2 million. Excluding currency exchange impacts, net sales for the period would have been up 2.7% as compared to the prior year. Total adjusted EBITDA of $228.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $3.1 million or 1.4% from fourth quarter 2014 pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $225.5 million, was unfavorably impacted by currency exchange of $10.9 million (including $0.9 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts on Corporate results). Excluding currency exchange impacts, adjusted EBITDA for the period would have been up 6.2% as compared to the prior year.

Corporate Results

Corporate adjusted EBITDA was ($22.3) million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to ($27.4) million pro forma adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $5.1 million improvement is primarily related to achieved synergies.

Income Taxes

Our adjusted effective income tax rates, which exclude discontinued operations, special and non-operating pension and OPEB items, were 18.8% and 24.0% for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our effective tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and geographic mix of income, and benefits from a favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions. The effective tax rate decrease compared to the prior year is driven by a variety of factors including mix of income and planning related to the Rockwood acquisition.

Cash Flow

Our cash flow from operations was approximately $360.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, down 27% versus the same period in 2014, primarily due to significant cash expenses in the current period related to the Rockwood acquisition, including acquisition fees, interest payments, costs to deliver synergy projects, and tax payments to repatriate cash from overseas. We had $213.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015, as compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2014. Cash on hand, cash provided by operations, a return of capital from an unconsolidated investment and proceeds from borrowings, funded $2.1 billion for acquisitions, $227.6 million of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment and dividends to shareholders of $119.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Outlook

2015 ended, and 2016 has begun, with much increased economic uncertainty. Nevertheless, we currently expect growth in most of our businesses in 2016. Full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range from $900 million to $950 million; adjusted EPS is expected to be $3.45 to $3.80, which would result in an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 28%. Reported free cash flow is expected to range from $450 million to $550 million.

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Information

(a)Non-operating pension and OPEB items, consisting of MTM actuarial gains/losses, settlements/curtailments, interest cost and expected return on assets, are not allocated to our reportable segments and are included in the Corporate category. Although non-operating pension and OPEB items are included in Cost of goods sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses in accordance with GAAP, we believe that these components of pension cost are mainly driven by market performance, and we manage these separately from the operational performance of our businesses. Non-operating pension and OPEB items included in Cost of goods sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses were as follows (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The MTM actuarial (gain) loss was ($38.9) million and $112.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and ($38.9) million and $130.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and resulted from the annual remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans in the fourth quarter. MTM actuarial gains/losses recorded in the fourth quarter may differ from the year-to-date amounts to the extent that remeasurements occurred in previous quarters. Settlements/curtailments for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from the termination of a domestic OPEB plan during the first quarter of 2015.

(b)In addition to the non-operating pension and OPEB items disclosed above, we have identified certain other items and excluded them from our adjusted earnings calculation for the periods presented.
