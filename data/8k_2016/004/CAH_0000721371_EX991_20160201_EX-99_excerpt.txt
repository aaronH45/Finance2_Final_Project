GAAP / Non-GAAP Reconciliation

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 The $56 million remeasurement of unrecognized tax benefits reduced, for fiscal 2014 second quarter, both diluted EPS from continuing operations and non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations by $0.16. The fiscal 2015 second quarter growth rates for diluted EPS from continuing operations and non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations, excluding the impact of the tax remeasurement, would have been (10) percent and 13 percent, respectively.

The sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We present non-GAAP net earnings attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. and non-GAAP effective tax rate (and presentations derived from these financial measures, including per share calculations) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are net earnings attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. and effective tax rate. We are unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because we cannot reliably forecast LIFO charges/(credits), restructuring and employee severance, amortization and other acquisition-related costs, impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, litigation (recoveries)/charges, net, and loss on extinguishment of debt, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact our future financial results.

Cardinal Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

This earnings release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In general, the measures exclude items and charges that (i) management does not believe reflect Cardinal Health, Inc.'s (the "Company") core business and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate activities; or (ii) relate to activities or actions that may have occurred over multiple or in prior periods without predictable trends. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the Company’s performance, evaluate the balance sheet, engage in financial and operational planning and determine incentive compensation. 

Management provides these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on its financial and operating results and in comparing the Company’s performance to that of its competitors. However, the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth above should be carefully evaluated.
