WILMINGTON, Del., Jan. 26, 2016 - DuPont (NYSE: DD), a science company that brings world-class, innovative products, materials, and services to the global marketplace, today announced fourth-quarter 2015 operating earnings of $0.27 per share compared with $0.57 per share in the prior year. GAAP1 (losses) earnings were ($0.26) per share, compared with $0.63 per share in the prior year. Refer to Schedule B for details of significant items. 

For the full-year 2015, DuPont delivered operating earnings of $2.77 per share, compared with $3.36 per share in the prior year. GAAP1 earnings were $2.09 per share, compared with $3.39 per share in the prior year.

Fourth-quarter sales were $5.3 billion, down 9 percent versus prior year due to negative impacts from currency (8 percent) and volume (1 percent). Full-year sales were $25.1 billion, down 12 percent versus prior year due to negative impacts from currency (7 percent), portfolio (2 percent) and volume (3 percent).

DuPont’s board of directors approved a first-quarter dividend of 38 cents per share, the 446th consecutive quarterly dividend since the company's first dividend in the fourth quarter of 1904. The first-quarter dividend of 38 cents per share of common stock is payable on March 14, 2016, to stockholders of record at the close of business on Feb. 12, 2016. Regular quarterly dividends of $1.125 per share on the $4.50 series preferred stock and $0.875 cents per share on the $3.50 series preferred stock also were declared, both payable on April 25, 2016, to stockholders of record as of April 8, 2016.

On Dec. 11, 2015, DuPont and The Dow Chemical Company announced that their boards of directors unanimously approved a definitive agreement under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals. The combined company will be named DowDuPont. The merger is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and approval by both Dow and DuPont shareholders. The parties intend to subsequently pursue a separation of DowDuPont into three independent, publicly traded companies through tax-free spin-offs. These separations would occur as soon as feasible, subject to regulatory and board approval.

“We are making progress on key initiatives, including further improving our cost structure and restructuring our organization to enhance our competitiveness,” said Ed Breen, Chair and CEO of DuPont. “In this pivotal year for DuPont we have three priorities: deliver operating earnings growth while positioning our businesses to compete successfully over the long term; continue to improve our capital allocation and working capital performance; and complete the proposed merger of equals with Dow. Our merger process is on track. We are meeting key milestones and have begun our planning to create three strong, highly focused, independent businesses in agriculture, material science and specialty products.”

The following is a summary of business results for each of the company’s reportable segments comparing fourth quarter with the prior year, unless otherwise noted.

Agriculture - An operating loss of $54 million resulted in $188 million lower operating earnings as increases in local price and cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by a $139 million negative currency impact and about a $30 million negative impact from the continued shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility. Prior year results benefitted from a timing impact from performance-based compensation adjustments and $36 million in gains from portfolio actions. Excluding the impact of currency, the segment would have reported operating earnings of $85 million.

Electronics & Communications - Operating earnings of $87 million decreased $5 million, or 5 percent, as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by competitive pressures impacting Solamet® paste. Excluding the impact of currency, operating earnings would have decreased by about 10 percent.

Industrial Biosciences - Operating earnings of $55 million increased $11 million, or 25 percent, as benefits from cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were partially offset by a $2 million negative impact from currency and slightly lower pricing. Operating margins improved 450 basis points. Excluding the impact of currency, operating earnings would have increased 30 percent. 

Nutrition & Health - Operating earnings of $85 million increased $6 million, or 8 percent, as cost reductions, continued productivity improvements and broad-based volume growth led by probiotics, cultures, and ingredient systems, more than offset the absence of an $18 million gain on termination of a distribution agreement in the prior year and a $12 million negative currency impact. Excluding the impact of currency, operating earnings would have increased by about 23 percent.

6

Performance Materials - Operating earnings of $281 million decreased $45 million, or 14 percent. Cost reductions, continued productivity improvements and increased demand for Performance Polymers in global automotive markets, were more than offset by lower ethylene price and volume and $19 million of negative currency impact. Operating earnings included a $33 million benefit from the sale of a business and tax benefits associated with a manufacturing site. Excluding the impact of currency, operating earnings would have decreased by about 8 percent.

Safety & Protection - Operating earnings of $182 million decreased $23 million, or 11 percent. Cost reductions and productivity improvements were more than offset by lower demand and a $2 million negative currency impact. Volume declines in Nomex® thermal-resistant fiber, Kevlar® high-strength material and Sustainable Solutions offerings were driven by weakness in the oil and gas industry and in military spending. Excluding the impact of currency, operating earnings would have decreased by about 10 percent.

2016 Outlook

Current difficult global economic conditions in agriculture and slower growth in emerging markets are expected to continue, challenging the company’s sales growth in 2016. The company expects 2016 operating earnings of $2.95 to $3.10 per share, including an expected benefit of $0.64 per share from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. The increase in the expected benefit results from identification of additional savings that will be delivered from the existing plans, including previously announced employee reduction estimates. The benefit from the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan will be weighted toward the second half of 2016 as specific actions continue to be implemented in the first and second quarters. 2016 operating earnings also includes approximately $0.30 per share of estimated negative currency impact due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, pressuring both the top and bottom line. A higher base tax rate, reflecting the expected geographic mix of earnings, is expected to negatively impact operating earnings by $0.05 - $0.10 per share. The currency impact is expected to be most significant in the first half of the year due to a further strengthening of the U.S dollar. Given the seasonality of the company’s operating earnings from Agriculture in the northern hemisphere, the company anticipates approximately two-thirds of the expected currency impact to occur in the first half of 2016. Excluding the impact of currency, the guidance for full-year operating earnings per share, including expected benefits from cost savings and share repurchases, represents a 17-23 percent increase year over year.

Second quarter 2015 also includes a tax charge of $(17) due to a state tax rate change associated with the separation. 

Fourth, third, second and first quarter 2014 included charges of $(16), $(10), $(4) and $(3), respectively, recorded in other operating charges associated with transaction costs related to the separation of the Performance Chemicals segment.

(2)

Fourth quarter 2015 included a $(798) restructuring charge consisting of $(793) recorded in employee separation/asset related charges, net and $(5) recorded in other income, net associated with structural actions across all businesses and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating businesses and aligning staff functions more closely with them. The charge included $(656) of severance and related benefit costs, $(109) of asset related charges, and $(33) of contract termination costs. Pre-tax charges by segment are: Agriculture - $(161), Electronics & Communications - $(93), Industrial Biosciences - $(51), Nutrition & Health - $(47), Performance Materials - $(61), Safety & Protection - $(53), Other - $(2), and Corporate expenses - $(330). 

 Fourth and Second quarter 2015 included a $23 and $(2) restructuring benefit (charge) recorded in employee separation/asset related charges, net, respectively, associated with the 2014 restructuring program. These adjustments were primarily due to the identification of additional projects in certain segments, offset by lower than estimated individual severance costs and workforce reductions achieved through non-severance programs. The net reduction impacted segment earnings as follows: Agriculture - $(3), Electronics & Communications - $15, Industrial Biosciences - $(1), Nutrition & Health - $(3), Performance Materials - $(1), Safety & Protection $4, Other - $(1), and Corporate expenses - $11.

 As a result of the company's plan to reduce residual costs associated with the separation of the Performance Chemicals segment and to improve productivity across all businesses and functions, fourth quarter and second quarter 2014 included $(297) and $(244) restructuring charges, respectively. The charges include $(301) of severance and related benefit costs, $(17) of other non-personnel charges, and $(223) of asset related charges, including $(65) of charges associated with the restructuring actions of a joint venture. The fourth quarter charge consisted of $(232) recorded in employee separation/asset related charges, net, and $(65) recorded in other income, net.

(3)Fourth quarter and second quarter 2015 included gains of $33 and $112, respectively, net of legal expenses, recorded in other income, net related to the company's settlement of a legal claim. This matter relates to the Safety & Protection segment. 

(4)

Fourth quarter 2015 included a benefit of $130 in other operating charges for reduction in accrual for customer claims related to the use of the Agriculture segment’s Imprelis® herbicide. At December 31, 2015, the company had an accrual balance of $41 which represents the company’s best estimate associated with resolving the remaining claims for this matter. 

The company recorded net insurance recoveries of $147 and $35 in other operating charges in the third and first quarter 2015, respectively, and $210 in the fourth quarter of 2014 for recovery of costs for customer claims related to the use of the Imprelis® herbicide.

(5)

During first quarter of 2015, a $(37) pre-tax impairment charge was recorded in employee separation / asset related charges, net for a cost basis investment within the Other segment. The assessment resulted from the venture's revised operating plan reflecting underperformance of its European wheat based ethanol facility and deteriorating European ethanol market conditions. One of the primary investors has communicated they would not fund the revised operating plan of the investee. As a result, the carrying value of our 6% equity investment in this venture exceeds its fair value.
