New York, January 15, 2016 — BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) today reported financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015.  

“Our full year 2015 results once again demonstrate that in times of global macro-uncertainty and market volatility, BlackRock’s diverse business model can generate strong and consistent financial results,” commented Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock.  

“Annual long-term net inflows of $152 billion, representing 4% organic asset growth, drove year-over-year increases in revenue, operating income and earnings per share, and reflected positive flows across the breadth of our active and index & iShares platform, including flows of more than $1 billion into 65 distinct Retail and iShares funds.  

“BlackRock is differentiated by its ability to provide active and index strategies, alternative investments, factor-based and hybrid client solutions through a single platform. These broad-based capabilities, supported by consistent investment performance and Aladdin risk management and technology, uniquely position BlackRock to help our clients solve their increasingly complex investment challenges and build upon our position as an industry thought leader.  

-1-  

“In 2015, consistent alpha generation at BlackRock drove both retail and institutional client engagement across our active platform, generating $61 billion of active net inflows. At December 31, 2015, 91% of our active taxable fixed income assets and 90% of our scientific active equity assets were above benchmark or peer median for the 3-year period and we continue to improve our fundamental active equity performance with 76% of fundamental active equity assets above benchmark or peer median for the 1-year period.  

“BlackRock’s iShares franchise generated $130 billion of net inflows during the year and captured the #1 share of flows globally, in the US and in Europe in 2015. iShares led the industry with $50 billion in fixed income ETF flows, as clients increasingly recognize that the benefits of ETFs – including liquidity, low cost and tax efficiency – apply to fixed income products just as they do to equities.  

“Anticipating change, and having the willingness and ability to adapt and invest for the future, is a crucial part of meeting our fiduciary commitment to our clients. Despite the volatile market environment, our financial resilience allowed us to make significant long-term investments in our business to position us for future growth. These investments included building out capabilities in alternatives, factor-based strategies, big data and retail technology, as well as in areas like infrastructure and impact investing, where we are working with our clients to create positive societal outcomes.  

“BlackRock’s 2015 results reflect the strength of our differentiated business model and the ability of our team to execute in a challenging market environment. The leadership enhancements we announced earlier this week once again demonstrate the deliberate approach that BlackRock and its Board take to develop our talent – regularly evolving the organization to broaden the team’s experience, to anticipate the needs of clients and to position us for future growth. I want to thank all BlackRock employees for their unwavering dedication to creating better financial futures for our clients and continuing to create long-term value for our shareholders.”

SUMMARY OF REVENUE  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Highlights  

   •   Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue increased $64 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher long-term average AUM and increased securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue of $137 million in the current quarter increased $20 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting an increase in average balances of securities on loan.  

Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue increased $4 million from the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to increased securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue increased $22 million from the third quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting higher lending spreads and higher average balances of securities on loan.  

   •   Performance fees increased $25 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting higher fees from equity products.  

Performance fees decreased $39 million from the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to the impact of strong performance from a single hedge fund with an annual performance measurement period that ended in the third quarter of 2015.

SUMMARY OF OPERATING EXPENSE  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Highlights  

   •   Employee compensation and benefits increased $63 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting higher headcount, higher deferred compensation expense and higher performance fees, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements.  

Employee compensation and benefits decreased $34 million from the third quarter of 2015, reflecting lower incentive compensation driven by lower operating income and lower performance fees.  

   •   General and administration expense increased $23 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting $23 million of transaction-related expense and higher technology expense. The increase was partially offset by lower foreign exchange remeasurement expense in the current quarter and closed-end fund launch costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014.  

General and administration expense increased $91 million from the third quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting seasonally higher marketing and promotional expense, $23 million of transaction-related expense, higher technology expense and higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense in the current quarter.  

INCOME TAX EXPENSE  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Highlights  

   •   The fourth quarter 2015 income tax expense included a $64 million noncash benefit, primarily related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of tax legislation enacted in the United Kingdom.  

The fourth quarter 2014 income tax expense benefited from $39 million of nonrecurring items.  

The third quarter 2015 income tax expense included a $6 million noncash tax benefit, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities as a result of domestic state and local tax changes.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (unaudited)   

BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  

Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.  

Computations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:  

(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors.  

   •   Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense). The year ended December 31, 2014 non-GAAP expense adjustments also included a $50 million general and administration expense due to the reduction of an indemnification asset. The $50 million general and administration expense and the offsetting $50 million tax benefit have been excluded from as adjusted results as there is no impact on BlackRock’s book value.  

   •   Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.  

Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. Management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue the Company earns. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenue.  

(2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted: Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, equals nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, adjusted for compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in nonoperating income (expense), GAAP basis.  

-13-  

(3) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation.  

For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustment related to the PNC LTIP funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. The year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 reflected the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill. The year ended December 31, 2015 included a $54 million noncash benefit, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities. The year ended December 31, 2014 included a $32 million noncash tax benefit and a $23 million noncash tax expense both arising primarily from state and local income tax changes. Such amounts for 2015 and 2014 have been excluded from the as adjusted results as they will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.  

(4) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
