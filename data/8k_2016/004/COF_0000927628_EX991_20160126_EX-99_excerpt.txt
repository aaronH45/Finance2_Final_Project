 Capital One Reports Fourth Quarter 2015 Net Income of $920 million, 

or $1.58 per share

McLean, Va. (January 26, 2016) – Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE: COF) today announced net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $920 million, or $1.58 per diluted common share, compared to the third quarter of 2015 with net income of $1.1 billion, or $1.98 per diluted common share, and the fourth quarter of 2014 with net income of $999 million, or $1.73 per diluted common share. 

Net income, excluding adjustments(1) for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $966 million or $1.67 per diluted common share. Adjustments are comprised of charges totaling $72 million associated with (i) closing the GE Healthcare acquisition and establishing an initial allowance and reserve related to the loans acquired; (ii) certain planned site closures; and (iii) revisions to the restructuring charges recorded in Q2 2015 to reflect updated information. 

“The headline for 2015 was industry-leading growth in Domestic Card loans and purchase volumes,” said Richard D. Fairbank, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Our 2015 results and the choices that drove them have put us in a strong position to deliver attractive shareholder returns, driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks, as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval.”

All comparisons below are for the full year of 2015 compared to the full year of 2014 unless otherwise noted.

2015 Full Year Income Statement Summary:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

◦12 percent increase in marketing.

◦7 percent increase in operating expenses, including $150 million in restructuring and related site closure charges, $61 million build in the U.K. PPI Reserve, and $20 million of charges associated with closing the GE Healthcare acquisition.

(1)  Net income excluding adjustments is a non-GAAP measure, which we believe is helpful for investors to understand the effect of the excluded items on our reported results. See Table 5 in Exhibit 99.2 for a reconciliation to the reported results on a GAAP basis.
