For the fourth quarter, FMC reported revenue of $899 million, a 1 percent increase over the same period in 2014. The company reported a net loss of $204 million, or a loss of $1.53 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to net income of $77 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding various restructuring charges and certain gains and charges related to the exit of certain businesses, adjusted earnings were $0.77 per diluted share, as compared to the prior-year quarter adjusted earnings of $0.85 per diluted share. 

Pierre Brondeau, FMC president, CEO and chairman said: “Market conditions throughout 2015 were some of the most difficult the company has faced. In particular, the devaluation of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, combined with weak agricultural markets created significant challenges for FMC Agricultural Solutions. Foreign exchange movements alone reduced FMC Agricultural Solutions' pro forma operating earnings by 55 percent compared to 2014. Despite challenging conditions in the global crop protection market, we continued to see strong demand for FMC’s proprietary products across all regions during the fourth quarter. However, high channel inventory levels in the Americas and foreign currency fluctuations continue to negatively impact this business. The integration of Cheminova continues to go well. In 2015, we realized $100 million in cost reductions, including $40 million from the Cheminova integration, and we are on track to deliver an additional $60 million to $70 million of savings in 2016.”

Segment Results

Fourth quarter results were significantly impacted by foreign exchange movements, particularly the depreciation of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, compared to the same period in 2014. Local currency price increases in Brazil recovered over 70 percent of the currency impact in the quarter. FMC Health and Nutrition posted a 5 percent increase in operating earnings, as manufacturing excellence initiatives and other cost reductions more than compensated for lower revenues. FMC Lithium’s performance exceeded expectations and the business saw encouraging demand and pricing trends across the portfolio.

FMC Agricultural Solutions

Fourth quarter revenue for FMC Agricultural Solutions was $657 million, an increase of 5 percent versus reported revenue for the prior-year quarter. Segment earnings were $101 million, a decline of 22 percent versus prior-year reported results. On a pro forma basis, as described in the Press Release Schedules on page 7, fourth quarter segment revenue declined 23 percent compared to the same period in 2014, and segment earnings were 8 percent lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, as price increases and ongoing cost reduction programs only partially offset the negative impact of foreign currency movements and reduced third-party sales. Segment revenue for 2015 was $2.25 billion, 4 percent higher than 2014, while full-year segment earnings were $364 million, 27 percent lower than 2014. On a pro forma basis, segment revenue for 2015 was $2.6 billion, 23 percent lower compared to 2014, and segment earnings were $384 million, 28 percent lower compared to 2014.

For 2016, full-year segment revenue is expected to be approximately $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion and full-year segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $380 million to $420 million, with first quarter segment earnings in the range of $70 million to $90 million. 

FMC Health and Nutrition 

FMC Health and Nutrition fourth quarter revenue was $172 million, 10 percent lower versus the prior-year quarter, driven by lower carrageenan and alginate sales, along with the impact of the weaker euro. Segment earnings of $46 million were up 4.5 percent compared to the prior-year quarter, as favorable raw material pricing and lower operating costs more than offset unfavorable foreign currency impacts and lower sales volumes. Segment revenue for 2015 was $785 million, 5 percent lower than 2014, while full-year segment earnings were $195 million, 4 percent higher than 2014. 

Segment revenue for the full year of 2016 is anticipated to be approximately $775 million to $825 million, while full-year segment earnings are expected to be between $198 million and $208 million. First quarter segment earnings are expected to be in the range of $46 million to $51 million. Earnings growth in 2016 is expected to be driven primarily by the benefits of operational improvements, along with continued growth in demand for excipients and nutritional products across emerging markets.

FMC Lithium

FMC Lithium reported fourth quarter segment revenue of $70 million, an increase of 1 percent from the prior-year quarter, and fourth quarter segment earnings of approximately $11 million, an increase of $3.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Segment earnings benefited from cost savings projects and lower raw material costs, along with price increases in our carbonate and hydroxide products. These positives more than offset Argentina inflation and currency impacts. Segment revenue for 2015 was $238 million, 7 percent lower than 2014, while full-year segment earnings were $23 million, $4.2 million lower than 2014. 

Demand for lithium remains strong and pricing trends continue to be favorable. Segment earnings are expected to be between $8 million and $12 million for the first quarter and between $33 and $43 million for the full year of 2016, an increase of 65 percent over 2015 at the mid-point of the range.

Corporate and Other

For the quarter, corporate and other expenses were $16 million, and net interest expense was $21 million. Depreciation and amortization was $23.5 million, and capital additions were $42.5 million. On December 31, 2015, gross consolidated debt was $2.15 billion, and debt, net of cash, was $2.1 billion. The Adjusted Tax Rate was 13 percent in the quarter and 22 percent for the full year. 

2016 Outlook

Based on an Adjusted Tax Rate of 24 to 26 percent, adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.80 for the full year 2016, an increase of 7 percent (at the mid-point) versus 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $2.47.

Webcast and Supplemental Information

The company will post supplemental information on the web at www.FMC.com, including its 2016 Outlook Statement, definitions of non-GAAP terms and reconciliations of non-GAAP figures to the nearest available GAAP term.

(b) Our non-operating pension and postretirement costs are defined as those costs related to interest, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements. These costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and we consider these costs to be outside our operational performance. We exclude these non-operating pension and postretirement costs from our segments as we believe that removing them provides a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our businesses, provides increased transparency and clarity in the performance of our retirement plans and enhances period-over-period comparability. We continue to include the service cost and amortization of prior service cost in our Adjusted Earnings results noted above. We believe these elements reflect the current year operating costs to our businesses for the employment benefits provided to active employees.

(c) There were no charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. On September 8, 2014, we announced that we will no longer proceed with the planned separation as a result of the planned acquisition of Cheminova A/S and divestiture of our FMC Alkali Chemicals division. Business separation costs for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 represent charges associated with the planned separation activities through September 8, 2014.

The GAAP tax provision includes certain discrete tax items including, but are not limited to: income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to ongoing business operations in the current year; unusual or infrequently occurring items; tax adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency remeasurement of certain foreign operations; certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years; certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets; and changes in tax law. Management believes excluding these discrete tax items assists investors and securities analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations thereby providing investors with useful supplemental information about FMC's operational performance.

FMC AGRICULTURAL SOLUTIONS PRO FORMA FINANCIAL RESULTS

(Unaudited, in millions)

In the second quarter of 2015, we began to present pro forma combined results for the FMC Agricultural Solutions segment for 2015 and 2014. We believe that reviewing our operating results by combining actual and pro forma results for the FMC Agricultural Solutions segment for 2015 and 2014 is more useful in identifying trends in, or reaching conclusions regarding, the overall operating performance of this segment. Our pro forma segment information will include adjustments as if the Cheminova transaction had occurred on January 1, 2014. Our pro forma data will also be adjusted for the effects of acquisition accounting but will not include adjustments for cost related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that might be achieved by the combined businesses. Pro forma amounts to be presented will not necessarily be indicative of what our results would have been had we operated Cheminova since January 1, 2014, nor our future results.
