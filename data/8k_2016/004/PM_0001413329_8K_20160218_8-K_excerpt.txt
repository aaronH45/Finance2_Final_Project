The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the “Indenture”) dated as of April 25, 2008, by and between PMI and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”).  

In connection with the issuance of the Notes, on February 18, 2016, PMI entered into a Terms Agreement (the “Terms Agreement”) with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., ING Financial Markets LLC and Mizuho Securities USA Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which PMI agreed to issue and sell the Notes to the Underwriters.

The Notes are subject to certain customary covenants, including limitations on PMI’s ability, with significant exceptions, to incur debt secured by liens and engage in sale/leaseback transactions. PMI may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at the applicable redemption prices described in the Prospectus Supplement, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. PMI may also redeem all, but not part, of the Notes of each series upon the occurrence of specified tax events as described in the Prospectus Supplement.
