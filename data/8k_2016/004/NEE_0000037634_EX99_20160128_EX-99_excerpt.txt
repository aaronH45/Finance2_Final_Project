NextEra Energy reports 2015 fourth-quarter and full-year financial results

•NextEra Energy achieves strong fourth-quarter results and excellent full-year growth

•Florida Power & Light Company continues to invest in the business to deliver outstanding customer value 

•NextEra Energy Resources signs about 2,100 megawatts of new contracted renewables in 2015

JUNO BEACH, Fla. - NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) today reported 2015 fourth-quarter net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $507 million, or $1.10 per share, compared to $884 million, or $2.00 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy’s 2015 fourth-quarter earnings were $539 million, or $1.17 per share, compared to $458 million, or $1.03 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014.

For the full year 2015, NextEra Energy reported net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $2.8 billion, or $6.06 per share, compared to $2.5 billion, or $5.60 per share, in 2014. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy’s full-year 2015 earnings were $2.6 billion, or $5.71 per share, compared to $2.3 billion, or $5.30 per share, in 2014.

Adjusted earnings for these periods exclude the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges, as well as the net effect of other than temporary impairments (OTTI) on certain investments and operating results from the Spain solar project. Adjusted earnings also exclude merger-related expenses in 2015 and, for the full year 2014, the gain associated with the Maine fossil assets. All of these items, except for the merger-related expenses, relate primarily to the business of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC and its affiliated entities.

NextEra Energy’s management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the board of directors, and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under the company’s employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NextEra Energy's management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energy’s fundamental earnings power. The attachments to this news release include a reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income attributable to NextEra Energy, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

"NextEra Energy delivered strong fourth-quarter results and exceeded its full-year financial expectations, finishing what was an excellent overall year of growth and execution," said NextEra Energy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim Robo. "NextEra Energy Resources had outstanding performance in 2015 for wind and solar development, marking its second most

successful year ever for renewable origination performance. We continue to believe that NextEra Energy Resources is well-positioned to capitalize on what is one of the most favorable environments for renewables development in recent history. At FPL, we continued to invest in the business and had our best-ever year in terms of reliability. FPL's typical residential customer bill remains among the lowest in the nation and lower than it was a decade ago. Earlier this month, FPL notified the Florida Public Service Commission that it expects to file a formal request in March for a four-year plan for new base rates. The rate plan is being designed to keep costs down for customers over the long term, while supporting continued investments that advance affordable, clean energy and enhance service reliability for customers."

Florida Power & Light Company

NextEra Energy’s principal rate-regulated utility subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), reported fourth-quarter 2015 net income of $365 million, or $0.79 per share, compared to $286 million, or $0.65 per share, for the prior-year quarter. For the full year 2015, net income was $1.65 billion, or $3.63 per share, compared to $1.52 billion, or $3.45 per share, in 2014. 

FPL’s fourth-quarter and full-year growth was driven by continued investments in clean, efficient generation and other infrastructure projects. FPL’s capital expenditures were approximately $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015, bringing full-year capital investments to approximately $3.4 billion. Regulatory capital employed in 2015 grew 6.8 percent, compared to the prior year.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, retail sales increased 11.7 percent, compared to the prior-year comparable quarter, driven by continued customer growth and weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, fourth-quarter 2015 retail sales increased 2.1 percent. During the fourth quarter of 2015, FPL averaged approximately 66,000 more customer accounts, compared to the comparable prior-year quarter, representing growth of 1.4 percent. Underlying usage increased 0.7 percent during the fourth quarter of 2015.

For the full year 2015, retail sales increased 5.6 percent, compared to the prior year. After adjusting for the effects of weather, full-year 2015 retail sales increased 1.2 percent. Underlying usage for the year decreased 0.3 percent. 

FPL's customer metrics are consistent with improving Florida economic indicators that the company tracks. The state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in December 2015 was 5.0 percent, down 0.7 percent from a year earlier. The number of jobs in Florida in December 2015 was up 2.9 percent from the prior year and up 15 percent from the low in December 2009, reflecting an increase of more than 1 million jobs.

Over the course of 2015, FPL continued to strengthen and deliver a customer value proposition that includes high reliability, award-winning customer service, a clean emissions profile and a typical residential customer bill that is the lowest in Florida and among the lowest in the nation. FPL ranks best in class among major U.S. utilities based on its operating and maintenance (O&M) costs per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of retail sales, and compared with the average utility’s O&M costs, the company's innovative practices and processes save customers nearly $2 billion a year. In 2015, FPL was recognized as having the best comprehensive reliability performance in the U.S. by PA Consulting Group. According to a survey of utility customers by Market Strategies International, FPL was named a 2015 Customer Champion, ranking second in the nation and first in the southeast region. In addition, FPL was recognized as one of the 2015 Most Trusted Brands in a Market Strategies International study.

In 2015, FPL continued to make solid progress on major capital projects, including the construction of the Port Everglades Clean Energy Center, which remains on budget and on schedule to begin operation in mid-2016. Since 2001, FPL's investments in highly efficient natural gas power plants have prevented more than 95 million tons of carbon emissions and saved customers more than $8 billion in fuel costs.

In addition, FPL's development of three new solar energy centers in Florida remains on track. Expected to be completed by the end of 2016, the three approximately 74-megawatt (MW) solar projects will roughly triple FPL's solar capacity and add to the overall fuel diversity of its fleet. 

Earlier this month, the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) approved the need for FPL’s proposed Okeechobee Clean Energy Center. FPL plans to invest more than $1.2 billion to build the new highly fuel-efficient power plant, which will be fueled by clean, U.S.-produced natural gas and is scheduled to begin generating affordable clean energy by mid-2019. The Okeechobee Clean Energy Center is part of the company's ongoing strategy of modernizing its system by investing in clean, highly fuel-efficient power generation, while phasing out older, less fuel-efficient plants that use coal and oil. FPL operates one of the most modern, clean, fuel-efficient and low-carbon generation fleets in the nation and is well-positioned today to comply with the EPA's Clean Power Plan.

Also this month, FPL notified the Florida PSC that it expects to file a formal request in March for new base rates to take effect once the company’s current approved rate agreement expires at the end of 2016. While the details are still being finalized, FPL intends to propose a four-year rate plan that would include three base rate adjustments phased in during the four-year period, including approximately $860 million, starting in January 2017; approximately $265 million, starting in January 2018; and approximately $200 million upon the commissioning of the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center in mid-2019. There would be no base rate adjustment in 2020 under the plan. 

The proposed adjustments would total about $13 a month or about $0.43 a day on the base portion of a typical residential customer bill. Combined with current projections for fuel and other costs, FPL estimates that its total typical residential customer bill would grow at about 2.8 percent per year, roughly the expected rate of inflation, from now through 2020. Even with the adjustments, FPL's typical residential customer bills would be lower than they were in 2006 through at least 2020. 

Under the plan, the base rate adjustments are needed to support FPL’s investments in long-term infrastructure and advanced technology that will help keep customer bills low and reliability high. For the period 2014 through the end of 2017, FPL is planning to invest nearly $16 billion to benefit customers, including improving electric service reliability, reducing emissions, improving generation fuel efficiency, strengthening its electric system to make it more resilient in severe weather and preparing for customer growth. In addition, FPL will continue to make significant investments throughout the base rate proposal timeframe to further improve service for its customers.

NextEra Energy Resources 

NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive energy business of NextEra Energy, reported a fourth-quarter 2015 contribution to net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $156 million, or $0.34 per share, compared to $615 million, or $1.39 per share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources’ earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $185 million, or $0.40 per share, compared to $179 million, or $0.40 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, NextEra Energy Resources reported net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $1,092 million, or $2.41 per share, compared to $989 million, or $2.25 per share, in 2014. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources’ earnings were $926 million, or $2.04 per share, compared to $837 million, or $1.90 per share, for the full year 2014. 

After re-evaluating its operating segments, NextEra Energy is now reporting its natural gas pipeline projects results under NextEra Energy Resources, reflecting the overall scale of its natural gas pipeline investments and management of these projects within the gas infrastructure activities at NextEra Energy Resources. The natural gas pipeline projects were formerly reported under Corporate and Other. While NextEra Energy has adjusted its 2014 results accordingly for comparison purposes, the effects are minimal due to immaterial contributions from these projects during early stages of development. In addition, contributions from the Texas natural gas pipelines, which were acquired in October 2015 by NextEra Energy Partners, LP are included in NextEra Energy Resources' results for 2015.

NextEra Energy Resources’ contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 was flat, compared to the comparable prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting contributions from new investments being offset by higher corporate and interest expenses.

For the full year 2015, NextEra Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted earnings per share increased $0.14, year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in its contracted renewables portfolio and strong results in the customer supply and trading business, reflecting, in part, a return to more normal levels of profitability in the first quarter of 2015. 

Growth in new investment added $0.31 per share year-over-year, reflecting new wind and solar investments placed into service and positive contributions from natural gas pipeline projects. The customer supply and trading business added $0.24 per share year-over-year. Partially offsetting the growth in the business were a negative impact of $0.22 per share year-over-year from higher interest and corporate expenses, primarily related to increased development activity, and lower earnings from existing assets of $0.22 per share year-over-year, reflecting poor wind resource. Results were also affected by share dilution and the absence of charges associated with the 2014 launch of NextEra Energy Partners.

During 2015, NextEra Energy Resources signed approximately 2,100 MW of new contracted renewables, including approximately 1,400 MW of wind and approximately 700 MW of solar.

Development activities for natural gas pipeline projects continue to progress well. The Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection natural gas pipeline projects are currently in the permitting process with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the company expects to be in a position to receive FERC approval during the first quarter of 2016. If approved, construction of the proposed interstate pipeline system would begin in mid-2016, with operations expected to commence in May of 2017. 

In addition, the Mountain Valley Pipeline joint venture also is in the permitting process with FERC, having filed a certificate application in October 2015. Earlier this month, the joint venture announced the addition of Consolidated Edison as an additional shipper on the line, as well as the addition of Con Edison Gas Midstream, LLC, as an equity partner. The approximately 300-mile interstate natural gas transmission pipeline is designed to transport clean-burning natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale regions to the growing demand markets in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. The proposed pipeline is expected to begin commercial operations by year-end 2018, subject to FERC approval. Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC, is a joint venture between EQT Midstream Partners, LP, majority owner and operator of the proposed pipeline, and affiliates of NextEra Energy, Consolidated Edison, Inc., WGL Holdings, Inc., Vega Energy Partners, Ltd and RGC Resources, Inc. 

Corporate and Other

In the fourth quarter of 2015 on a GAAP basis, Corporate and Other earnings increased $0.01 per share, compared to the comparable prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, Corporate and Other earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015 were flat, compared to the prior-year quarter. For the full year 2015, Corporate and Other earnings increased $0.12 per share on a GAAP basis, compared to 2014. On an adjusted basis, full-year 2015 Corporate and Other earnings increased $0.09 per share year-over-year.

Outlook 

NextEra Energy continues to expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.35 for 2016 and in the range of $6.60 to $7.10 for 2018, implying a compound annual growth rate of 6 to 8 percent per year through 2018, off a 2014 base.

NextEra Energy’s adjusted earnings expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards, the unrealized mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges, as well as net OTTI losses on securities held in NextEra Energy Resources’ nuclear decommissioning funds, none of which can be determined at this time. Adjusted earnings expectations also exclude the operating results from

the Spain solar project and merger-related expenses. In addition, adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things: normal weather and operating conditions; continued recovery of the national and the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; current forward curves; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; no divestitures other than to NextEra Energy Partners, LP or acquisitions; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to governmental tax policy or incentives. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results.
