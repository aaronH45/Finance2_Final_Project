Item 5.03Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

On February 24, 2016, the board of directors (the “Board”) of Synchrony Financial (the “Company”) amended the Company’s bylaws (the “Amended and Restated Bylaws”) to include: (i) the adoption of a majority voting standard in uncontested elections of directors; (ii) updates to reflect the separation of the Company from General Electric Company; and (iii) certain minor and conforming edits.

Section 2.2(B) of the Amended and Restated Bylaws now provides that each director in an uncontested election will be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that director’s election. For purposes of these provisions, a majority of votes cast means that the number of votes cast “for” a director must exceed the number of votes “against” that director (with “abstentions” and “broker non-votes” not counted as a vote either “for” or “against” that director’s election). Directors in contested elections will continue to be elected by a plurality of votes cast. 

The foregoing description of the changes effected by the Amended and Restated Bylaws is qualified by reference to the Amended and Restated Bylaws, which are filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this current report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
