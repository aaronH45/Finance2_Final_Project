Item 1.01Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On February 26, 2016, LKQ Corporation (“LKQ” or the "Company") entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) among LKQ, Pirate Merger Sub LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of LKQ (“Merger Sub”), KPGW Holding Company, LLC (“KPGW”), and the equity holders of KPGW. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into KPGW with KPGW being the surviving entity and becoming an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of LKQ (the “Merger”). The purchase price to be paid by LKQ to the equity holders of KPGW reflects an enterprise value of $635 million. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and conditions, and closing will be subject to receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. Subject to the satisfaction of all conditions to closing, the transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2016. The transaction will be financed using borrowings under LKQ’s credit facility. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Merger Agreement, which will be filed with LKQ’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
