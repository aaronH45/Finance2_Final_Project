ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Jan. 28, 2016 — Abbott today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2015. 

· Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which excludes specified items, was $0.62 in the fourth quarter and $2.15 for the full year, at the midpoint of Abbott’s previous guidance range and reflecting 8.6 percent growth for the full year. Reported diluted EPS from continuing operations under GAAP was $0.46 in the fourth quarter and $1.72 for the full year. 

· Fourth-quarter worldwide sales of $5.2 billion increased 4.9 percent on an operational basis and decreased 3.1 percent on a reported basis. 

· Full-year sales increased 9.1 percent on an operational basis and 0.8 percent on a reported basis. Full-year sales in emerging markets increased double digits excluding the impact of 2014 acquisitions and foreign exchange. 

· For the full year 2015, Abbott expanded its adjusted gross and operating margin ratios by 260 and 90 basis points over the prior year, respectively. The gross and operating margin ratios under GAAP improved by 250 and 120 basis points over the prior year, respectively. 

· Abbott issues full-year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20. Projected full-year 2016 EPS under GAAP is $1.55 to $1.65. Abbott’s 2016 forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuelan operations as a result of challenging market conditions in that country. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and Venezuela, the midpoint of Abbott’s 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range would reflect strong double-digit growth. 

“In 2015, we achieved top-tier sales and earnings growth despite a challenging currency environment,” said Miles D. White, chairman and chief executive officer, Abbott. “Our underlying performance continues to be strong.”

International sales increased 5.6 percent on an operational basis and decreased 5.7 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter. 

Full-year 2015 worldwide sales of $20.4 billion increased 9.1 percent on an operational basis and 0.8 percent on a reported basis, including an unfavorable 8.3 percent effect of foreign exchange.

Nutrition

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Worldwide Nutrition sales increased 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter on an operational basis and decreased 0.2 percent on a reported basis, including an unfavorable 5.7 percent effect of foreign exchange. 

Worldwide Pediatric Nutrition sales increased 3.7 percent on an operational basis and decreased 1.3 percent on a reported basis in the quarter, including an unfavorable 5.0 percent effect of foreign exchange. In the U.S., sales growth in the quarter was led by continued consumer uptake of several recently launched non-GMO products. International growth was led by share expansion of ElevaTM in the premium segment of the Chinese market and double-digit operational growth across several Latin American countries, partially offset by a difficult comparison to the fourth quarter 2014, when sales increased strong double digits. 

Worldwide Adult Nutrition sales increased 7.9 percent on an operational basis and 1.3 percent on a reported basis in the quarter, including an unfavorable 6.6 percent effect of foreign exchange. International growth was led by continued category expansion in Latin America and other priority international markets. U.S. adult nutrition sales increased 4.8 percent led by growth of Ensure® in the retail and institutional segments of the market.

Diagnostics 

($ in millions) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Worldwide Diagnostics sales increased 7.0 percent in the fourth quarter on an operational basis, driven by continued above-market growth in both emerging and developed markets. Sales decreased 1.1 percent on a reported basis, including an unfavorable 8.1 percent effect of foreign exchange. 

Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 7.4 percent in the quarter on an operational basis and decreased 1.8 percent on a reported basis, including an unfavorable 9.2 percent effect of foreign exchange. Operational sales growth in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets and continued share gains in the U.S. and internationally. 

Molecular Diagnostics sales increased 2.6 percent in the quarter on an operational basis and decreased 3.9 percent on a reported basis, including an unfavorable 6.5 percent effect of foreign exchange. Strong growth in the infectious disease testing business, which remains Abbott’s core focus area in Molecular Diagnostics, led operational growth in the quarter. As expected, U.S. growth was impacted by the planned scale down of the genetics business. 

Point of Care Diagnostics sales increased 8.6 percent in the quarter on an operational basis as this business continues to expand its product offering and geographic presence in targeted developed and emerging markets. Sales increased 7.3 percent on a reported basis, including an unfavorable 1.3 percent effect of foreign exchange.

Established Pharmaceuticals 

($ in millions)

Sales in Key Emerging Markets increased 12.1 percent on an operational basis, driven by continued double-digit growth in India, China, and Russia. Sales decreased 4.3 percent on a reported basis, including an unfavorable 16.4 percent effect of foreign exchange. 

For the full year 2015, Established Pharmaceutical sales increased double digits excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. Growth was driven by commercial initiatives and locally-relevant portfolio expansion in key geographies. 

During the year, Abbott successfully integrated the acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. These businesses strengthened Abbott’s capabilities, relevant product portfolios, and leadership in key geographies.

ABBOTT ISSUES EARNINGS-PER-SHARE OUTLOOK FOR 2016 

Abbott is issuing full-year 2016 guidance for earnings per share, excluding specified items, of $2.10 to $2.20. Abbott’s 2016 forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuelan operations as a result of challenging market conditions in that country. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and Venezuela, the midpoint of Abbott’s 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range would reflect strong double-digit growth. 

Abbott forecasts net specified items for the full year 2016 of approximately $0.55 per share. Specified items include intangible amortization expense, charges associated with cost reduction initiatives and deal and other expenses. 

Including net specified items, projected earnings per share under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) would be $1.55 to $1.65 for the full year 2016. 

Abbott is issuing first-quarter 2016 guidance for earnings per share, excluding specified items, of $0.38 to $0.40.

Including specified items, projected earnings per share under GAAP would be $0.23 to $0.25 for the first quarter.
