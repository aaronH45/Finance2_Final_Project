AND ANNUAL 2015 FINANCIAL RESULTS

SALT LAKE CITY, January 25, 2016 – Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ: ZION) (“Zions” or “the Company”) today reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $88.2 million, or $0.43 per diluted common share, compared to net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $84.2 million, or $0.41 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2015 and $66.8 million, or $0.33 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2014.

During the second quarter of 2015, the Company sold the remaining portfolio of its collateralized debt obligation (“CDO”) securities and recognized a one-time pretax loss of approximately $137 million, or $0.42 after-tax per diluted common share.

•Net charge-offs for energy-related loans were $24 million during the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $17 million during the third quarter of 2015. The Company increased the allowance for credit losses on its energy portfolio to greater than 5% of oil and gas-related loans due to the duration and amount of the decline in energy prices. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The Company successfully completed the merger of its seven subsidiary banks to a single national bank charter on December 31, 2015.

Harris H. Simmons, Chairman and CEO of Zions Bancorporation, stated, “We were encouraged with the relatively strong improvement in net interest income, and when combined with the expected benefit from the December interest rate increase, we expect to see continued expansion in the net interest margin in 2016. Despite some headwinds in loan growth, particularly due to energy-related loan reductions, we experienced improvement in loan growth in the fourth quarter relative to the prior quarter.” Mr. Simmons continued, “Credit quality trends, when taken as a whole, remain strong and Zions’ credit performance ratios are among the strongest in the industry. As expected, credit quality for the energy portfolio deteriorated, although we are pleased with the relatively limited energy net charge-offs during the quarter, and the relatively strong pay-downs and payoffs of energy-related loans in the quarter. We boosted the reserve level in the fourth quarter due to the recent additional weakness in energy

commodity prices, but we expect that our loan losses from this portfolio should be manageable.” Mr. Simmons concluded, “Finally, we are encouraged with the successful achievement of our financial goals for the second half of 2015 announced in early June, and expect to continue to make progress toward achieving our 2016 and 2017 targets. In addition to achieving our expense goals, during 2015 we substantially strengthened our balance sheet through the liquidation of our remaining CDO portfolio, completed the consolidation of our bank charters as part of an effort to simplify our structure, and made strong progress on technology initiatives that will provide us with a modern, streamlined and fully integrated core operating platform.”

Loans 

Net loans and leases held for investment increased $536 million, or 1.3% (approximately 5% on an annualized basis based on fourth quarter growth) to $40.6 billion at December 31, 2015 from $40.1 billion at September 30, 2015. Excluding the strategic reduction in energy-related loans, net loans and leases increased $728 million, or 2.0% (8.0% on an annualized basis based on fourth quarter growth) during the quarter, compared to $176 million during the prior quarter calculated on the same basis. The increase in loans was primarily related to commercial and industrial and consumer loans across the Company’s geographic footprint.

Average loans and leases held for investment of $40.3 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015 increased slightly from $40.0 billion during the third quarter of 2015. Unfunded lending commitments were $18.1 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $18.0 billion at September 30, 2015. 

Energy-Related Exposure 

The overall performance of the energy-related loan portfolio has been substantially consistent with the Company’s initial communications in late 2014, which concluded that credit quality deterioration was expected throughout 2016 due to declining energy prices. During the fourth quarter of 2015, energy-related loans declined $192 million, or 6%, primarily as a result of payoffs and pay-downs; further attrition during the next several quarters is likely.

The following table presents the distribution of energy-related loans by customer market segment:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Because many borrowers operate in multiple businesses, judgment has been applied in characterizing a borrower as energy-related, including a particular segment of energy-related activity, e.g., upstream or downstream. 

Consistent with management’s expectations, the majority of loan downgrades in the fourth quarter of 2015 reflected deterioration in the financial condition of oilfield services companies, and to a lesser degree a small number of downgrades in the upstream portfolio. As a result of the fall redetermination of exploration and production energy-related loan borrowing bases, the borrowing base for total exploration and production commitments, including new commitments, declined approximately 9% since the spring 2015 redetermination. Energy-related loan net charge-offs were $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and were predominantly in the energy services portfolio, compared to $17 million in the third quarter. The Company has a substantial allowance for credit losses for the portfolio of greater than 5% of oil and gas related loans.

Asset Quality 

Despite the deterioration in the energy portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2015, the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio was generally strong. Nonperforming assets declined 4% to $357 million at December 31, 2015 from $372 million at September 30, 2015. Classified loans increased 3% to $1.37 billion at December 31, 2015 from $1.32 billion at September 30, 2015. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and leases and other real estate owned declined to 0.87% at December 31, 2015, compared to 0.92% at September 30, 2015. Excluding energy-related

loans, the ratio of nonperforming assets was stable compared to the prior quarter, at 0.76%. The allowance for credit losses increased to $681 million, which was 1.68% of loans and leases at December 31, 2015, compared to $678 million, or 1.69% of loans and leases at September 30, 2015. 

Total net charge-offs were $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, or an annualized 0.13% of average loans, compared to $31 million, or an annualized 0.31% of average loans, in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding energy-related charge-offs, the Company experienced net recoveries of $11 million. The Company provided $22.7 million for loan losses during the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $18.3 million during the third quarter of 2015, largely reflective of continued weakness in the energy sector. 

Deposits 

Total deposits increased to a record $50.4 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $48.9 billion at September 30, 2015, as a result of increases in commercial client balances. Average total deposits increased $1.1 billion to $50.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $48.9 billion for the third quarter of 2015. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased $796 million to $22.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $21.6 billion for the third quarter of 2015, and were 45% of average total deposits. 

Debt and Shareholders’ Equity

On November 16, 2015, the Company redeemed at maturity approximately $124 million par amount of 5.5% subordinated and convertible notes. The total effective cost of this debt was approximately 14% during 2015; the higher effective cost was due to the amortization of debt discount. The Company recognized $2.3 million of interest expense on this debt in the fourth quarter of 2015 prior to its redemption.

On November 17, 2015 the Company completed a tender offer to purchase $176 million of its Series I preferred stock for an aggregate cash payment of $180 million. Assuming no further tender offers, the preferred dividends for 2016 are expected to be $11.7 million in the first and third quarters and $15.1 million in the second and fourth quarters, respectively. However, the Company’s 2015 capital plan, which runs through the second quarter of 2016, allows for an additional use of up to $120 million of cash for preferred stock redemptions.

Tangible book value per common share increased to $27.63 at December 31, 2015, compared to $27.42 at September 30, 2015. 

The estimated Basel III common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio was 12.20% at December 31, 2015, compared to 12.16% at September 30, 2015. The fully phased-in ratio was not substantially different.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income increased to $449 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 from $425 million in the third quarter of 2015. The net interest margin increased to 3.23% in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 3.11% in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in net interest margin was primarily driven by a change in the mix of interest-earning assets, as cash held in money market investments was transitioned to term investment securities. Additionally, the net interest margin benefited from recoveries on previously charged off commercial loans, and high cost long-term debt that matured in the third and fourth quarters. Recoveries on commercial loans had a positive impact of $8 million, equaling 5 basis points benefit to the net interest margin for the quarter. Yields on new loan production increased slightly from the prior quarter, and pricing in medium and larger-sized loans seems to have firmed, while some modest pressure remains on the pricing of small business loans. 

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income from customer-related fees in the fourth quarter of 2015 was stable compared to the prior quarter and increased approximately 4% from the prior year period. Most of the year-over-year increase was due to an increase in treasury management fees, credit card and interchange fees, and interest rate swap management fees. Total noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $124 million, compared to $131 million for the third quarter of 2015; however, the primary reason for the decline in noninterest income was primarily due write-downs on private equity investments reflected in the dividends and other investment income line. 

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $403 million, compared to $396 million for the third quarter of 2015, and $423 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. These results reflect our commitment to and achievement of our efficiency ratio and noninterest expense goals for 2015. The increase in total noninterest expense was primarily due to payments related to the loss-sharing agreement with the FDIC, an increase in the accrual for legal-related matters, and fees paid to managers of the Company’s Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”) investments. The fees were related to a successful IPO for a particular portfolio investment. These increases in noninterest expense were partially offset by a decline in salaries and employee benefits and a negative provision for unfunded lending commitments. The negative provision for unfunded lending commitments was primarily due to the resolution of a letter of credit, which was not energy-related, that has carried a specific reserve for several quarters due to the troubled nature of the borrower.

As previously mentioned, the Company made meaningful progress with its corporate restructuring and cost initiatives during the quarter. At year-end 2015 the Company had achieved approximately 50% of its 2017 goal to achieve gross pre-tax cost savings of $120 million from operational expense initiatives. Adjusted noninterest expense for 2015 was $1,581 million, down approximately 2%, compared to $1,611 million for 2014.

Income Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 30.5%, which is lower than the effective tax rate for the prior year fourth quarter of 34.8%. The decrease was primarily due to a higher level of tax credits generated during 2015 due in part to the Company’s continued investment in technology upgrades.

This press release presents the non-GAAP financial measures previously shown. The adjustments to reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures are included where applicable in financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company considers these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results. 

The Company believes that excluding the amounts associated with these adjustments to present the non-GAAP financial measures provides a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which will assist regulators, investors, and analysts in analyzing the operating results or financial position of the Company and in predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to assess the performance of the Company’s business or its financial position for evaluating bank reporting segment performance, for presentations of Company performance to investors, and for other reasons as may be requested by investors and analysts. The Company further believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors and analysts to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management. 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company, they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP.
