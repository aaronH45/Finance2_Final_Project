        "3 In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2015-17, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.” This ASU requires the offset of all deferred tax assets and liabilities, including valuation allowances, for each tax-paying jurisdiction within each tax-paying component. The net deferred tax must be presented as a single noncurrent amount. In connection with the early adoption of ASU 2015-17 as well as due to other reclassifications made to tax accounts, changes were made to the prior year to conform to the current year presentation."
