STAMFORD, CT – Harman International Industries, Incorporated (NYSE: HAR), the premier connected technologies company for automotive, consumer and enterprise markets, today announced results for the second quarter ended December 31, 2015.  

Net sales for the second quarter were $1.8 billion, an increase of 12 percent compared to the prior year or 19 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency translation (ex-FX). Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, net sales increased 12 percent compared to the prior year. Connected Car net sales increased two percent (nine percent ex-FX) due to higher take rates, stronger automotive production, and platform expansions. Lifestyle Audio net sales increased 20 percent (26 percent ex-FX) due to new product introductions and expanded global distribution channels in consumer audio, the acquisition of Bang & Olufsen Automotive and higher car audio take rates. Net sales in Professional Solutions decreased seven percent (four percent ex-FX) mainly due to weakness in emerging markets. Connected Services net sales were $170 million compared to $74 million in the prior year, primarily due to the expansion of the Company’s services portfolio as a result of the acquisition of Symphony Teleca (STC).  

Excluding restructuring, non-recurring charges and acquisition-related items, second quarter operating income increased 15 percent to $186 million compared to $162 million in the prior year, and EBITDA increased 14 percent to $225 million compared to $198 million in the prior year. Earnings per diluted share were $1.84 compared to $1.79 in the prior year.  

On a GAAP basis, second quarter operating income increased seven percent to $159 million compared to $149 million in the prior year and EBITDA increased 17 percent to $217 million compared to $186 million in the prior year. Earnings per diluted share decreased six percent to $1.55 compared to $1.65 in the prior year, due to higher acquisition-related items, including interest expense and share count. The Company recorded $26 million of restructuring, non-recurring charges and acquisition-related items compared to $14 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to non-cash amortization of acquired intangible assets.  

“I am pleased to announce our 11th consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth. Our strong first half results were in-line with our expectations. While we are closely monitoring macroeconomic developments, at this time, we are on track to deliver on our full year plan,” said Dinesh C. Paliwal, the Company’s Chairman, President and CEO. “HARMAN continues to innovate and bring industry-first solutions to market. We are also partnering with key technology leaders such as Google, Microsoft and Under Armour to capitalize on the opportunities presented by IoT for automotive, enterprise and consumer electronics. In addition, our acquisition of TowerSec will strengthen our cybersecurity leadership position for automotive.”
