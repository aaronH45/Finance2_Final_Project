 Item 2.02Results of Operations and Financial Condition  

On January 28, 2016, Nucor Corporation issued a news release reporting its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. 

The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit attached hereto, is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. Furthermore, the information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). However, management believes that the adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share non-GAAP financial measures included within the news release provides users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing the Company’s ongoing performance. The results for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 included two atypical impairment charges, thus the adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share numbers which exclude those two impairment charges better reflect ongoing financial results. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.
