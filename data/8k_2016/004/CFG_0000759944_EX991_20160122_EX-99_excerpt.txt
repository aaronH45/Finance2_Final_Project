PROVIDENCE, RI (January 22, 2016) Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE: CFG or “Citizens”) today reported fourth quarter net income of $221 million, or $0.42 per diluted common share, compared with $220 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share, for third quarter 2015 and $197 million, or $0.36 per diluted common share, for fourth quarter 2014. There were no net restructuring charges and special items in fourth quarter 2015 and third quarter 2015, compared with $0.03 per diluted common share reduction in fourth quarter 2014, as detailed in the Discussion of Results portion of this release. Fourth quarter Adjusted diluted EPS* of $0.42 increased 5% from $0.40 diluted EPS in third quarter 2015 and 8% from Adjusted diluted EPS* of $0.39 in fourth quarter 2014.  

2015 net income available to common stockholders of $833 million, or $1.55 per diluted common share, decreased from $865 million in 2014, which included a $180 million after-tax Chicago Divestiture gain and a net $105 million after-tax restructuring charges and special items. 2015 Adjusted net income available to common stockholders* of $864 million increased 9% from the prior year, while Adjusted diluted EPS* of $1.61 were up 13% from 2014.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bruce Van Saun commented, “We made great progress and had a strong year overall in 2015. We delivered solid execution on our plan to improve Citizens’ performance for all stakeholders. This resulted in improving financial performance and permitted RBS to fully divest their ownership position. As we enter 2016, we remain very focused on execution — we want to continue to grow our balance sheet, serve our customers well and operate efficiently to deliver positive operating leverage.” He added, “I thank our 18,000 colleagues for their great efforts in 2015, and I look forward to another successful year in 2016.”  

Return on Average Tangible Common Equity* (“ROTCE”) was 6.7% in fourth quarter 2015 and improved from 6.6% in third quarter 2015 and 6.1% in fourth quarter 2014.

Results  

   •   Total revenue of $1.2 billion, up 2%.  

   •   Net interest income of $870 million increased $14 million, reflecting an increase in average interest-earning assets and improved yields as the net interest margin improved one basis point to 2.77%.  

   •   Noninterest income of $362 million was up $9 million, or 3%, driven by growth in service charges and fees.

Balance Sheet  

   •   Average loans and leases increased $1.4 billion, or 1.5%, on strength in both retail and commercial loans.

Discussion of Results:  

Fourth quarter 2015 pre-provision profit of $422 million and net income of $221 million included no net restructuring charges and special items. Third quarter 2015 pre-provision profit of $411 million and net income of $220 million similarly included no restructuring charges and special items. Fourth quarter 2014 results were reduced by a net $33 million pre-tax, or $20 million after tax, of restructuring charges and special items, largely related to efforts to improve processes and enhance efficiencies, as well as rebranding and separation from RBS.  

Full-year 2015 net income was reduced by a net $50 million pre-tax, or $31 million after tax, of restructuring charges and special items, compared with full-year 2014 net income, which was benefited by a net $119 million pre-tax, or $75 million after tax, of net restructuring charges and special items. All references to Adjusted results* exclude the impact of restructuring charges and special items.  

In addition to the restructuring charges and special items associated with the Chicago Divestiture that have been excluded from Adjusted Results*, the second quarter 2014 Chicago Divestiture also had the following estimated effects on full-year 2015 results, as compared to full-year 2014, decreasing full-year 2015 results by the following estimated amounts: $26 million in net interest income, $24 million in noninterest income and $42 million in noninterest expense.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Adjusted pre-provision profit* of $422 million increased $11 million from third quarter 2015, reflecting a $23 million increase in total revenue, partially offset by a $12 million increase in noninterest expense. Fourth quarter net income of $221 million was relatively stable with third quarter 2015 as revenue growth was largely offset by the impact of higher noninterest expense and higher provision for credit losses, which included a $14 million reserve build.  

Adjusted pre-provision profit* increased $34 million from Adjusted fourth quarter 2014 levels, driven by a $53 million increase in total revenue, partially offset by noninterest expense growth. Compared to Adjusted fourth quarter 2014 results, net income increased $4 million, or 2%, reflecting a $53 million increase in total revenue, partially offset by a $19 million increase in noninterest expense, a $19 million increase in provision including a $14 million reserve build and an increase in the effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were up 8% given net income growth and a 4% reduction in share count.  

Full-year 2015 Adjusted net income* of $871 million increased $81 million, or 10%, from full-year 2014 Adjusted net income of $790 million, driven by 3% total revenue growth and flat noninterest expense, as savings from our efficiency initiatives were used to fund investments in the businesses to drive future revenue growth. Results also reflected a $17 million decrease in provision expense, given stable credit quality in a benign environment and a modest increase in the effective tax rate. Full-year 2015 Adjusted diluted earnings per share were up 13% from the prior period, reflecting growth in net income and a reduction in common shares outstanding.

Net interest income of $870 million in fourth quarter 2015 increased $14 million, or 2%, compared with third quarter 2015, driven largely by a $1.4 billion increase in average loans and leases, improved loan yields and lower deposit costs, partially offset by growth in liquidity and higher subordinated and senior debt borrowing costs. Net interest margin increased one basis point to 2.77% in fourth quarter 2015, from 2.76% in third quarter 2015, benefitting from initiatives to improve loan yields, deposit costs and mix.  

Fourth quarter 2015 net interest income increased $30 million, or 4%, from fourth quarter 2014 as the benefit of 7% average loan growth, improving retail loan yields and a reduction in pay-fixed swap costs was partially offset by the impact of higher deposit costs, largely in the first half of 2015, as well as higher subordinated and senior debt borrowing costs. Results also reflect lower investment portfolio income. Net interest margin decreased three basis points, primarily reflecting higher deposit and borrowing costs.

 1 Other income includes bank owned life insurance and other income.  

Noninterest income of $362 million in fourth quarter 2015 increased $9 million from third quarter 2015 as higher service charges and fees and an $8 million increase in securities gains were partially offset by a decline in capital markets fees, as market headwinds impacted originations. Results also reflect a $5 million decrease in other income from third quarter 2015 levels, which included $8 million of branch real estate gains.

Citizens Financial Group, Inc.  

Noninterest income increased $23 million from fourth quarter 2014, as strength in service charges and fees and higher securities gains, other income and mortgage banking fees were partially offset by lower capital markets fees, reflecting weak market conditions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Noninterest expense of $810 million in fourth quarter 2015 increased $12 million from third quarter 2015 due to higher outside services, equipment and software amortization expense resulting from our technology initiatives. Efficiency initiatives positively impacted salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and other operating expense.  

Compared with fourth quarter 2014, noninterest expense decreased $14 million given restructuring costs in the year-ago quarter. Compared with Adjusted* fourth quarter 2014 results, noninterest expense increased $19 million, or 2%, as the impact of efficiency initiatives helped to fund continued strategic investments in the businesses to drive future revenue growth.  

The company’s effective tax rate was 33.4% in fourth quarter 2015, compared to 34.1% in third quarter 2015 and 30.6% in fourth quarter 2014.

Consumer Banking net income of $67 million in fourth quarter 2015 remained relatively flat compared to third quarter 2015, which included $8 million of branch real estate gains. Net interest income increased $9 million, or 2%, from third quarter 2015, driven by mortgage, student, unsecured consumer loan growth, improved loan yields and lower deposit costs. Noninterest income decreased $9 million, or 4%, from third quarter 2015, as seasonal growth in service charges and fees was more than offset by a decrease in other income from third quarter levels, which included $8 million of branch real estate gains. Noninterest expense of $624 million remained stable as increased outside services expense tied to investment initiatives and higher equipment and other expense was partially offset by lower salaries and employee benefits expense and insurance expense. Provision for credit losses of $65 million remained relatively stable.  

Net income of $67 million in fourth quarter 2015 increased $15 million, or 29%, compared with fourth quarter 2014, as a 5% increase in total revenue delivered meaningful operating leverage relative to a 2% increase in noninterest expense. Consumer Banking total revenue increased $37 million from fourth quarter 2014, reflecting strength in net interest income and noninterest income. Noninterest expense increased $13 million as higher outside services expense tied to investment initiatives, higher taxes and insurance and other operating expense were partially offset by lower credit collection costs and occupancy expense. Provision for credit losses of $65 million remained relatively stable with fourth quarter 2014, largely reflecting stable credit quality trends.

Commercial Banking net income of $152 million in fourth quarter 2015 increased $7 million, or 5%, from third quarter 2015, as a $9 million increase in total revenue and $5 million decrease in provision for credit losses was partially offset by a $5 million increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $2 million, or 1%, due to 2% average loan and lease growth and lower deposit costs. Average loans and leases increased $649 million led by Commercial Real Estate, Mid-Corporate and Franchise Finance lines of business, while deposits remained relatively stable. Noninterest income increased $7 million, or 7%, from third quarter 2015, as an increase in service charges and fees, leasing income and interest rate product fees was partially offset by lower capital markets fees as market headwinds impacted originations. Noninterest expense increased $5 million, or 3%, from third quarter 2015 due to an increase in regulatory, equipment and outside services expenses, partially offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefits and insurance costs. Provision for credit losses resulted in a net recovery of $2 million in fourth quarter of 2015, delivering an improvement of $5 million from third quarter 2015, reflecting lower net charge-offs.  

Commercial Banking net income of $152 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased $12 million, or 9%, from fourth quarter 2014, reflecting the benefit of a $14 million increase in total revenue, a $3 million decrease in provision for credit losses and flat noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $18 million, or 6%, from fourth quarter 2014, as the benefit of $3.7 billion average loan and lease growth and a $2.1 billion average deposit growth was partially offset by loan yield compression. Loan growth was driven by strength in Commercial Real Estate, Franchise Finance, Mid-Corporate and Industry Verticals. Noninterest income decreased $4 million, or 4%, as improvement in service charges and fees was more than offset by lower capital markets fees as market headwinds impacted originations. Noninterest expense was flat compared to fourth quarter 2014 levels, which included higher regulatory costs and an operating lease residual write-down. Fourth quarter 2015 results reflect increased insurance costs, equipment and outside services expense, and lower occupancy costs.

 2 Includes held for sale.  

Other recorded net income of $2 million in fourth quarter 2015 compared to net income of $7 million in third quarter 2015. The decrease was largely due to increased noninterest expense and provision for credit losses, which included a $14 million reserve build, partially offset by higher total revenue. Net interest income of $4 million increased $3 million from the prior quarter, driven by residual funds transfer pricing. Noninterest income of $29 million reflects an $8 million increase in securities gains compared to third quarter 2015. Noninterest expense of $6 million reflects an increase in incentive compensation. Provision for credit losses in other of $28 million in fourth quarter 2015 included a $14 million reserve build, compared with $9 million of provision for credit losses in third quarter 2015, which included a $1 million reserve build. Provision for credit losses within other mainly represents the residual change in the consolidated allowance for credit losses after attributing the respective net charge-offs to the Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking segments, while also factoring in net charge-offs related to the non-core portfolio.  

Other net income of $2 million in fourth quarter decreased from net income of $5 million in fourth quarter of 2014 because of higher wholesale funding costs, continued non-core loan run off and an increase in provision expense, which reflects a $14 million reserve build compared to an $8 million reserve release in fourth quarter 2014. These items were partially offset by higher securities gains and a reduction in restructuring charges and special items.

Retail loans increased $763 million, while commercial loans and leases increased by $645 million, driven by strength in Commercial Real Estate, Mid-Corporate and Franchise Finance. Retail loan growth largely reflects growth in residential mortgage, student loans and other retail, which includes the impact of our new consumer unsecured product, partially offset by lower home equity balances and a reduction in the non-core portfolio.  

Average interest-earning assets increased $5.5 billion, or 5%, from fourth quarter 2014, driven by average loan growth of $6.2 billion, or 7%. Commercial loans and leases growth of $3.6 billion and retail loan growth of $2.6 billion were modestly offset by a $788 million reduction in investments and interest-bearing deposits. Commercial loan growth in fourth quarter 2014 was paced by Commercial Real Estate, Franchise Finance, Corporate Finance and Mid-Corporate.

Investments and interest-bearing deposits of $26.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 increased $1.0 billion from September 30, 2015. Investments and interest-bearing deposits decreased $762 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2014, driven by a reduction in securities available for sale reflecting more efficient balance sheet management. At the end of fourth quarter 2015, the average effective duration of the securities portfolio increased to 3.5 years, compared with 3.3 years at September 30, 2015, largely reflecting an increase in long-term rates, which slowed prepayment speeds. The average effective duration of the securities portfolio remained stable from December 31, 2014.  

Period-end loans and leases of $99.0 billion at December 31, 2015 increased $1.6 billion, or 2%, from $97.4 billion at September 30, 2015. The linked-quarter increase was driven by a $945 million increase in commercial loans and leases and a $666 million increase in retail loans. Commercial loan and lease growth reflects a $538 million increase in commercial loans, a $293 million increase in commercial real estate and an increase in lease outstandings. Retail loan growth was driven by a $526 million increase in residential mortgages and a $513 million increase in student loans, partially offset by a reduction in home equity outstandings, auto and continued run off in the non-core portfolio. During the quarter, we purchased a net $308 million of student loans and $94 million of residential mortgages, partially offset by net auto purchase run off of $28 million and commercial lease sales of $76 million.  

Period-end loans and leases increased $5.6 billion from December 31, 2014, reflecting a $3.0 billion increase in commercial loans and leases and a $2.6 billion increase in retail loans.

Credit quality during the quarter remained strong with relatively low levels of charge-offs and nonperforming loans and leases. Nonperforming loans and leases of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015 increased $26 million from September 30, 2015, reflecting an $18 million increase in commercial and an $8 million increase in retail. The increase in commercial was driven by a $35 million increase in commercial real estate, tied to a single relationship, which more than offset decreases in other commercial categories. The increase in retail was driven by a $7 million increase in residential mortgage and a $4 million increase in auto, largely due to portfolio growth and seasoning. Nonperforming loans and leases to total loans and leases of 1.07% at December 31, 2015 remained relatively stable compared to 1.06% at September 30, 2015 and decreased 11 basis points from 1.18% at December 31, 2014. Nonperforming loans and leases of $1.1 billion decreased $41 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2014, reflecting improving trends in both Consumer and Commercial categories. The improvement in retail nonperforming loans was driven by a $69 million improvement in real estate-secured categories, partially offset by an increase in student and auto, largely reflecting portfolio growth and seasoning. Other real estate owned of $46 million increased $7 million from September 30, 2015 and $4 million from December 31, 2014.  

Nonperforming non-core loans totaled $156 million in fourth quarter 2015, compared with $162 million in third quarter 2015, and $184 million in fourth quarter 2014. Nonperforming non-core loans to total non-core loans of 6.8% at December 31, 2015, compared with 6.5% at September 30, 2015, and 6.1% at December 31, 2014. Troubled debt restructured loans (“TDRs”) of $1.3 billion included $1.2 billion of retail loans and $156 million of commercial loans. Performing TDRs represented 69% of total TDRs as of December 31, 2015, compared with 68% as of September 30, 2015, and 69% as of December 31, 2014.  

Net charge-offs of $77 million, or 31 basis points of total loans and leases, in fourth quarter 2015 were relatively flat compared to $75 million, or 31 basis points, in third quarter 2015. Retail product net charge-offs of $80 million increased $10 million from $70 million in third quarter 2015, driven by a $7 million increase in auto. Commercial product net recoveries were $3 million in fourth quarter 2015 compared with net charge-offs of $5 million in third quarter 2015. These results included non-core net charge-offs of $13 million in fourth quarter 2015 compared to $9 million in third quarter 2015, and $15 million of losses in fourth quarter 2014. Annualized non-core net charge-offs to total average non-core loans and leases of 2.20% in fourth quarter 2015, compared with 1.36% in third quarter 2015, and 1.92% in fourth quarter 2014.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

This document contains non-GAAP financial measures. The table below presents reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures. These reconciliations exclude restructuring charges and/or special items, which are usually included, where applicable, in the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. Special items include regulatory expenses and expenses relating to our initial public offering.  

The non-GAAP measures set forth below include “total revenue”, “noninterest income”, “noninterest expense”, “pre-provision profit”, “income before income tax expense (benefit)”, “income tax expense (benefit)”, “net income (loss)”, “salaries and employee benefits”, “outside services”, “occupancy”, “equipment expense”, “amortization of software”, “other operating expense”, “net income (loss) per average common share”, “return of average common equity” and “return on average total assets”. In addition, we present computations for “tangible common equity (period-end)”, “pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital”, “return on average tangible common equity”, “return on average total tangible assets,” “operating leverage” and “efficiency ratio” as part of our non-GAAP measures.  

We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because these are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe restructuring charges and special items in any period do not reflect the operational performance of the business in that period and, accordingly, it is useful to consider these line items with and without restructuring charges and special items. We believe this presentation also increases comparability of period-to-period results.  

We also consider pro forma capital ratios defined by banking regulators but not effective at each period end to be non-GAAP financial measures. As analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using these pro forma ratios, we believe they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess our capital adequacy on the same basis.  

Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for our results as reported under GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements  

This document contains forward-looking statements within the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements regarding potential future share repurchases and future dividends are forward-looking statements. Also, any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words “believes”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “intends”, “plans”, “goals”, “targets”, “initiatives”, “potentially”, “probably”, “projects”, “outlook” or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” and “could.”  

Forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management, and on information currently available to management. Our statements speak as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation:  

   •   negative economic conditions that adversely affect the general economy, housing prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits which may affect, among other things, the level of nonperforming assets, charge-offs and provision expense;  

   •   the rate of growth in the economy and employment levels, as well as general business and economic conditions;  

   •   our ability to implement our strategic plan, including the cost savings and efficiency components, and achieve our indicative performance targets;  

   •   our ability to remedy regulatory deficiencies and meet supervisory requirements and expectations;  

   •   liabilities and business restrictions resulting from litigation and regulatory investigations;  

   •   our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;  

   •   the effect of the current low interest rate environment or changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale;  

   •   changes in interest rates and market liquidity, as well as the magnitude of such changes, which may reduce interest margins, impact funding sources and affect the ability to originate and distribute financial products in the primary and secondary markets;  

   •   the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin;  

25  

Citizens Financial Group, Inc.  

   •   financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation and regulation relating to bank products and services;  

   •   a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks;  

   •   management’s ability to identify and manage these and other risks; and  

   •   any failure by us to successfully replicate or replace certain functions, systems and infrastructure provided by RBS.  

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends will depend on our financial condition, earnings, cash needs, regulatory constraints, capital requirements (including requirements of our subsidiaries), and any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock, or as to the amount of any such dividends.  

More information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and March 3, 2015.  

Note: Percentage changes, per share amounts and ratios presented in this document are calculated using whole dollars.
