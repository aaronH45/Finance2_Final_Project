Under the Company’s non-employee director compensation program (the “Program”), Ms. Zane will receive standard non-employee director compensation, prorated for the time period from the effective date of her appointment to the date of the Company’s 2016 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2016 Annual Meeting”), which includes (i) a cash retainer of $4,698 (representing the prorated amount of the Program’s annual cash retainer of $90,000) and (ii) an equity award valued at $9,657 (representing the prorated amount of the Program’s annual grant of equity having a value of $185,000) vesting at the end of her term. The actual number of shares to be granted to Ms. Zane will be determined on the date of grant, May 2, 2016, which is the first business day of the month following the month in which she will be appointed. 

In connection with her appointment to the Board, the Company intends to enter into an indemnification agreement with Ms. Zane in substantially the same form as the Company has entered into with each of the Company’s existing directors and as previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

A copy of our press release announcing the appointment of Ms. Zane is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
