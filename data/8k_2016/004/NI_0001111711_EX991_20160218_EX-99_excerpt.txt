Schedules 1 and 2 of this news release contain a reconciliation of net operating earnings and operating earnings to GAAP net income and operating income, respectively.

For the three months ended Dec. 31, 2015, NiSource’s net operating earnings (non-GAAP) were $99.6 million, or $0.31 per share, compared with $79.6 million, or $0.25 per share, for the same period in 2014.

As outlined in our third quarter update, on July 1, 2015 NiSource successfully completed the separation of Columbia Pipeline Group Inc. (CPG) (NYSE: CPGX) through a distribution of all of the common stock of CPG held by NiSource to NiSource shareholders. CPG financial results for all periods are classified as discontinued operations.

“2015 was a dynamic year of exciting change and progress for NiSource,” said NiSource President and CEO Joseph Hamrock. “Our teams executed for our customers through our investment-driven utility business plan while maintaining the commitments outlined throughout the separation of 

1

Columbia Pipeline Group. We finished 2015 continuing to build momentum with an eye toward continued growth and enhanced performance in 2016.”

NiSource invested a record $1.37 billion across its gas and electric utilities in 2015. Since outlining its $30 billion in identified long-term regulated utility infrastructure investments, the company has now executed against approximately $2 billion of those investments. NiSource expects to invest$1.4 billion in capital during 2016 to continue to modernize and improve its system across all seven states. 

Significant NiSource milestones achieved in 2015 included:

•J.D. Power recognizing NiSource utilities for customer satisfaction, with Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania (CPA) an award winner for the second straight year, and Columbia Gas of Virginia (CVA) named one of the most improved brands in the nation. 

•Replacing 361 miles of priority pipe, including removing the last known cast iron pipe from the CVA system, and continuing to enhance safety and reliability for customers. 

•Completing significant regulatory initiatives that support enhanced safety, reliability, training and customer programs. This includes successful rate settlements in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia; extension of CVA’s modernization program; approval of the first year of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts’ (CMA) Gas System Enhancement Plan; and continued execution of Columbia Gas of Ohio's (COH) modernization program.

•Completion of the last of three flue gas desulfurization (FGD) units at Northern Indiana Public Service Co.’s (NIPSCO) coal-generation facilities, the culmination of $850 million in investments over approximately five years that have improved air quality and help ensure NIPSCO’s generation fleet remains in compliance with current environmental regulations.

•Full deployment of automated meter reading (AMR) devices across our nearly 4 million natural gas and electric customers, completing a six-year project. This new meter technology enhances customer service and safety and reduces costs.

Fourth Quarter 2015 Highlights

During the fourth quarter of 2015, NiSource continued to advance its business plan by executing on its customer focused infrastructure investments and regulatory programs.

Gas Distribution Operations

•On Dec. 3, 2015, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved a settlement in CPA's base rate case. The settlement maintains CPA's ability to continue replacing and upgrading its natural gas distribution system. The approved rate adjustment went into effect on Dec. 18, 2015 and will increase the company’s annual revenues by approximately $28 million. The settlement also included new incentives that will significantly reduce costs for customers converting to natural gas.

•On Nov. 1, 2015, CMA implemented new rates under its previously approved base rate case settlement. The settlement supports CMA’s continued effort to modernize its pipeline infrastructure and transform its operations to continue to serve customers safely and reliably. The approved settlement provides for increased annual revenues of $32.8 million starting Nov. 1, 2015, with an additional $3.6 million annual increase starting Nov. 1, 2016.

•NIPSCO continued executing on its seven-year, $817 million natural gas system modernization program. The company filed its semi-annual tracker and program update on 

2

Aug. 31, 2015, and expects an order from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) in the first quarter of 2016.

Electric Operations 

•On Dec. 16, 2015, the IURC approved a settlement between NIPSCO, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and NIPSCO’s largest industrial customers which resolved all outstanding issues raised by parties in an Indiana Court of Appeals proceeding related to the company’s previous long-term electric infrastructure modernization plan.

•On Dec. 31, 2015, NIPSCO filed a new $1.3 billion, seven-year electric infrastructure modernization plan with the IURC. The plan is focused on electric transmission and distribution investments made for safety, reliability, and system modernization. NIPSCO expects an order on its seven-year plan in the third quarter of 2016.

•NIPSCO remains on schedule with its electric base rate case filed on Oct. 1, 2015 with the IURC. The case seeks to update rates to reflect the current costs of generating and distributing power, plus ongoing investments which are delivering substantial benefits to customers, including programs that have reduced the duration of power outages by 40 percent. An IURC decision is expected in the third quarter of 2016.

•Progress also continued on two major electric transmission projects designed to enhance region-wide system flexibility and reliability. Right-of-way acquisition, permitting and substation construction are under way for both projects. Line and tower construction is expected to begin in 2016. These projects involve an investment of approximately $450 million for NIPSCO and are anticipated to be in service by the end of 2018.

“Our well-established utility investment programs continued to produce high value for our customers and investors in 2015,” Hamrock said. “Now in our first full year as a pure utility company, we’re deeply committed to leadership in safety and service to our customers and communities as core drivers of sustained and growing value.”

2016 Guidance, Financial & Growth Commitments Reaffirmed

Hamrock reaffirmed that NiSource expects to deliver non-GAAP net operating earnings per share of $1.00 to $1.10 in 2016. As outlined above, NiSource also expects to make approximately $1.4 billion in planned infrastructure enhancement investments during the year. This 2016 earnings and investment guidance provides the starting point for NiSource's long-term annual earnings per share and dividend growth projections of 4-6 percent annually.

NiSource remains committed to maintaining solid, investment grade credit ratings. Standard & Poor’s rates NiSource at BBB+, Moody’s rates NiSource at Baa2, and Fitch rates NiSource at BBB- with a positive outlook. As of Dec. 31, 2015, NiSource maintained $1.2 billion in net available liquidity, consisting of cash and available capacity under credit facilities.

Corporate and Other Operations reported operating earnings of $10.0 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2015, compared to an operating earnings loss of $10.2 million for the comparable prior period.

Regulation G Disclosure Statement

This press release includes financial results and guidance for NiSource with respect to net operating earnings and operating earnings, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC’s Regulation G. The company includes such measures because management believes they permit investors to view the company’s performance using the same tools that management uses and to better evaluate the Company’s ongoing business performance. With respect to such guidance, it should be noted that there will likely be differences between such measures and GAAP equivalents due to various factors, including, but not limited to, fluctuations in weather, environmental laws, the impact of asset sales, separation-related costs, and certain income tax items. NiSource is not able to estimate the impact of such factors on GAAP earnings and, as such, is not providing earnings guidance on a GAAP basis.
