PEOPLE’S UNITED FINANCIAL REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER  

NET INCOME OF $0.23 PER SHARE AND OPERATING EARNINGS OF $0.22 PER SHARE  

BRIDGEPORT, CT – People’s United Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBCT) today reported net income of $70.8 million, or $0.23 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $64.7 million, or $0.22 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2014, and $68.4 million, or $0.23 per share, for the third quarter of 2015. Included in this quarter’s results is a net after-tax gain of $6.1 million ($0.02 per share) resulting from the sale of the Company’s payroll services business as well as non-operating expenses of $2.5 million after-tax ($0.01 per share).  

Operating earnings were $67.2 million, or $0.22 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $65.1 million, or $0.22 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2014, and $68.4 million, or $0.23 per share, for the third quarter of 2015.  

For the year ended December 31, 2015, net income totaled $260.1 million, or $0.86 per share, compared to $251.7 million, or $0.84 per share, for 2014. Operating earnings were $262.5 million, or $0.87 per share, for 2015, compared to $244.5 million, or $0.82 per share, for 2014.  

The Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.1675 per share quarterly dividend, payable February 15, 2016 to shareholders of record on February 1, 2016. Based on the closing stock price on January 20, 2016, the dividend yield on People’s United Financial common stock is 4.6 percent.  

“We are pleased to report growth in full-year operating earnings per share for the sixth consecutive year, particularly given the prolonged low interest rate environment,” commented Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer. “These results are driven by the strategic investments we have made in talent, products and services. Throughout 2015, we continued to move the Company forward by organically growing loans and deposits, strengthening fee businesses, implementing technology enhancements and furthering cross-sell efforts.”  

Barnes continued, “As we continually evaluate the best ways to serve customers and improve operating efficiency, we sold our payroll services business in the fourth quarter to the Company’s current payroll software licensor and entered into a long-term referral agreement. The sale provides customers high-quality payroll solutions at comparable costs and minimal transition impact.”

Barnes concluded, “Entering 2016, the franchise is well-positioned to achieve ongoing growth as we continue to execute on the significant opportunities that exist across our attractive footprint, especially within the Boston and New York markets. We remain focused on improving profitability, while continuing to build the business for long-term success.”  

“Our 2015 financial performance reflects ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management,” stated David Rosato, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “Record full year operating earnings of $263 million increased over seven percent from the prior year and benefited from both higher net interest income and fee revenues. We achieved strong annual loan and deposit growth of seven percent and nine percent, respectively. At the same time we maintained excellent asset quality across each portfolio as evidenced by net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans of only eight basis points for the full year.”  

Rosato concluded, “Capital ratios continue to be strong, especially given the Company’s diversified business mix and history of exceptional credit risk management. Our balance sheet remains asset sensitive which positions us well to benefit from a rising interest rate environment.”  

At December 31, 2015, People’s United Financial’s common equity tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital ratios were 9.8 percent and 11.7 percent, respectively, and the tangible equity ratio stood at 7.2 percent. For People’s United Bank N.A., common equity tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital ratios were 10.2 percent and 12.6 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2015.  

Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average total loans on an annualized basis were 0.09 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, a slight increase from 0.06 percent in the third quarter of 2015, but an improvement from 0.13 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the originated loan portfolio, non-performing loans equaled 0.58 percent of loans at December 31, 2015, compared to 0.68 percent at September 30, 2015 and 0.77 percent at December 31, 2014.  

Operating return on average assets of 0.71 percent for the fourth quarter of 2015 declined from 0.73 percent in the third quarter of 2015 and 0.75 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating return on average tangible stockholders’ equity of 10.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 declined from 10.5 percent in the third quarter of 2015, but increased from 10.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014.  

People’s United Financial, a diversified financial services company with $39 billion in assets, provides commercial and retail banking, as well as wealth management services through a network of approximately 400 branches in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Through its subsidiaries, People’s United Financial provides equipment financing, brokerage and insurance services.

Loans acquired in connection with business combinations are initially recorded at fair value, determined based upon an estimate of expected cash flows, including a reduction for estimated credit losses, and without carryover of the respective portfolio’s historical allowance for loan losses. A decrease in expected cash flows in subsequent periods may indicate that a loan is impaired, which would require the establishment of an allowance for loan losses. As such, selected asset quality metrics have been highlighted to distinguish between the ‘originated’ portfolio and the ‘acquired’ portfolio.  

NON-PERFORMING ASSETS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Reported net of government guarantees totaling $16.9 million at December 31, 2015, $17.3 million at September 30, 2015, $16.6 million at June 30, 2015, $17.5 million at March 31, 2015 and $17.6 million at December 31, 2014.  

 (2) Represents acquired loans that meet People’s United Financial’s definition of a non-performing loan but are not, under the accounting model for acquired loans, subject to classification as non-accrual in the same manner as originated loans. Because acquired loans are initially recorded at an amount estimated to be collectible, losses on such loans, when incurred, are first applied against the non-accretable difference established in purchase accounting and then to any allowance for loan losses recognized subsequent to acquisition.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP  

In addition to evaluating People’s United Financial’s results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible equity ratios, tangible book value per share and operating earnings metrics. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People’s United Financial’s underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. Further, the efficiency ratio and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control, while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of People’s United Financial’s capital position.  

The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People’s United Financial to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangible assets, losses on real estate assets and non-recurring expenses, which are also excluded in arriving at operating non-interest expense) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis plus total non-interest income (including the FTE adjustment on bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) income, and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans and acquired loans, and non-recurring income) (the denominator). In addition, operating lease expense is excluded from total non-interest expense and netted against operating lease income within non-interest income to conform with the reporting approach applied to fee-based businesses already presented on a net basis. People’s United Financial generally considers an item of income or expense to be non-recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.  

Operating earnings exclude from net income those items that management considers to be of such a non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), People’s United Financial’s results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to: (i) non-recurring gains/losses; (ii) writedowns of banking house assets and related lease termination costs; (iii) severance-related costs; (iv) merger-related expenses, including acquisition integration and other costs; and (v) charges related to executive-level management separation costs, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Operating earnings per share is derived by determining the per share impact of the respective adjustments to arrive at operating earnings and adding (subtracting) such amounts to (from) GAAP earnings per share. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average total assets. Operating return on average tangible stockholders’ equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average tangible stockholders’ equity. The operating dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.  

The tangible equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible stockholders’ equity (total stockholders’ equity less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the denominator). Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible stockholders’ equity by common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) common shares).  

In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by People’s United Financial for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions.

 (1) Operating lease expense is excluded from total non-interest expense and netted against operating lease income within non-interest income to conform with the reporting approach applied to fee-based businesses already presented on a net basis.  

 (2) Items classified as “other” and deducted from non-interest expense for purposes of calculating the efficiency ratio include, as applicable, certain franchise taxes, real estate owned expenses, contract termination costs and non-recurring expenses.  

 (3) Items classified as “other” and added to (deducted from) total revenues for purposes of calculating the efficiency ratio include, as applicable, asset write-offs and gains associated with the sale of branch locations.
