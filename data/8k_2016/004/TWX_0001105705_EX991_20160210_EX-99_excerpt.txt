   •   Company posted Adjusted Operating Income of $6.9 billion  

   •   Adjusted EPS grew 14% to $4.75

NEW YORK, February 10, 2016 – Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2015.  

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bewkes said: “We had another very successful year in 2015, demonstrating once again Time Warner’s ability to deliver strong financial performance as well as creative and programming excellence. Revenues grew 3% and Adjusted Operating Income was up 19%. All three of our operating divisions increased revenue and profits while also investing to capitalize on the shift to on-demand viewing and growing worldwide demand for the very best video content. Warner Bros. had its best year ever in videogames, led by Mortal Kombat X and Batman: Arkham Knight, and remained the number one supplier of broadcast television programming, including the biggest new hit of the TV season in Blindspot. As we embark on what promises to be a very strong year for Warner Bros. theatrically, Mad Max: Fury Road and Creed received a combined 11 nominations for the 88th Academy Awards.”  

Mr. Bewkes continued: “Home Box Office grew subscribers both on its linear networks and through HBO NOW, our new stand-alone streaming service. Once again, HBO distinguished itself with the combination of the biggest Hollywood hits and best original programming. In 2015, HBO received 43 Primetime Emmys, the most in a single year by any network in at least 25 years — led by a record 12 Emmys for Game of Thrones. Turner continued to prove its tremendous value to its audiences, distributors, and advertisers with TBS, TNT and Adult Swim all ranking among ad-supported cable’s top 10 networks in primetime among adults 18-49 for the year. CNN was the fastest-growing top 40 cable network in its key demographic in the U.S. for the year, and Cartoon Network was the only top 3 kids network to grow ratings. Further demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns, during 2015 we returned $4.8 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and this morning announced a 15% increase to our dividend and a new $5 billion share repurchase program.”  

Full-Year Company Results  

Full-year revenues and Adjusted Operating Income increased 3% and 19% from 2014 to $28.1 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively, due to growth across all operating divisions. The growth in Adjusted Operating Income benefited from lower programming charges at Turner and restructuring and severance charges across the Company, partially offset by a swing in intersegment eliminations. Revenues and Adjusted Operating Income included the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $1.1 billion and $480 million, respectively, in the year. Operating Income increased 15% from 2014 to $6.9 billion.  

The Company posted 2015 Adjusted Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations (“Adjusted EPS”) of $4.75, up 14% from $4.15 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS included the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of $0.50 in the current year. Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations was $4.58 in 2015 compared to $4.41 in 2014.  

In 2015, Cash Provided by Operations from Continuing Operations reached $3.9 billion and Free Cash Flow totaled $3.6 billion. As of December 31, 2015, Net Debt was $21.6 billion, up from $19.8 billion at the end of 2014, due to share repurchases, dividends and investments and acquisitions, partially offset by the generation of Free Cash Flow.  

Fourth-Quarter Company Results  

Revenues decreased 6% to $7.1 billion due to a decline at Warner Bros., partially offset by increases at Home Box Office and Turner. Adjusted Operating Income declined 12% to $1.4 billion due to decreases at all operating divisions as well as a swing in intercompany eliminations. Revenues and Adjusted Operating Income included the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $270 million and $115 million, respectively, in the quarter. Operating Income was flat at $1.4 billion as the prior year quarter included a $173 million foreign currency charge related to the remeasurement of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency resulting from a change in the foreign currency exchange rate used by the Company.  

The Company posted Adjusted EPS of $1.06, up 8% versus $0.98 for the prior year quarter. Adjusted EPS included the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of $0.12 in the current year quarter. Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations was $1.06 compared to $0.84 in the prior year quarter.

 (d) Operating Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2015 included the impact of a $22 million foreign currency charge related to the remeasurement of the Company’s net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency resulting from a change in the foreign currency exchange rate used by the Company from the SICAD 2 exchange rate to the Simadi rate.  

 (e) Operating Income (Loss) for both the three months and year ended December 31, 2014 included the impact of a $173 million foreign currency charge related to the remeasurement of the Company’s net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency resulting from a change in the foreign currency exchange rate used by the Company from the official rate to the SICAD 2 exchange rate.

TURNER  

Full-Year Results  

Revenues increased 2% ($200 million) to $10.6 billion, benefiting from increases of 16% ($88 million) in Content and other revenues, 2% ($69 million) in Advertising revenues and 1% ($43 million) in Subscription revenues. The increase in Content and other revenues was due to higher subscription video-on-demand revenues, primarily from licensing select Turner original programming to Hulu. Advertising revenues benefited from domestic growth, primarily due to Turner’s news business, and local currency growth at Turner’s international networks, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates. The increase in Subscription revenues was due to higher domestic rates and local currency growth at Turner’s international networks, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates and lower domestic subscribers.  

Adjusted Operating Income increased 32% ($1.0 billion) to $4.1 billion primarily due to lower programming and restructuring and severance expenses. Programming costs declined 11% due to a decrease in programming charges ($395 million). Excluding the charges from both years, programming costs declined in the low single digits primarily due to lower syndicated programming expenses as a result of the abandonment of certain programming in 2014 and the absence of NASCAR programming, partially offset by higher costs associated with airing the MLB playoffs.  

Operating Income increased 38% ($1.1 billion) to $4.1 billion. The current and prior years included $17 million and $137 million, respectively, of foreign currency charges related to the remeasurement of Turner’s net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency.  

In 2015: TBS, TNT and Adult Swim ranked among ad-supported cable’s top 10 networks in primetime among adults 18-49, TBS was the #1 ad-supported cable network in primetime among adults 25-54 and the #1 ad-supported entertainment cable network in primetime among adults 18-49, CNN was the fastest growing top 40 cable network in the U.S. among adults 25-54 and CNN.com was the most viewed digital news source. Cartoon Network was the only top 3 kids network to grow ratings in 2015, and in December 2015, was the #1 cable network in VOD in the U.S., a position it has held for 21 straight months. Bleacher Report ranked as the #2 digital sports destination averaging 37 million monthly unique visitors across its desktop and mobile platforms in 2015.   

Fourth-Quarter Results  

Revenues increased 2% ($54 million) to $2.7 billion, due to an increase of 5% ($52 million) in Advertising revenues. Subscription and Content and other revenues were essentially flat in the quarter. Advertising revenues increased due to domestic growth and local currency growth at Turner’s international networks, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates. The increase in domestic advertising revenues was due to growth at Turner’s news business and the airing of the MLB playoffs, including additional games in the quarter. Subscription revenues benefited from domestic growth and local currency growth at Turner’s international networks, offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates. Domestic subscription revenues increased due to higher rates and the favorable comparison to the impact of a contract dispute with a distributor in the prior year’s quarter, partially offset by lower subscribers.  

5  

Adjusted Operating Income decreased 15% ($140 million) to $781 million as the increase in revenues was more than offset by higher programming expenses. Programming costs grew 22% primarily due to higher programming charges ($87 million). Excluding the charges from both periods, programming costs grew in the low teens mainly due to higher costs associated with airing the MLB playoffs, including additional games in the quarter, and the timing of original programming.  

Operating Income declined 1% ($11 million) to $777 million as the prior year quarter included the $137 million foreign currency charge.  

HOME BOX OFFICE  

Full-Year Results  

Revenues increased 4% ($217 million) to $5.6 billion, due to increases of 4% ($170 million) in Subscription revenues and 6% ($47 million) in Content and other revenues. Subscription revenues grew primarily due to higher domestic rates, partially offset by lower international revenues, which included the impact of the transfer to Turner of the operation of HBO’s basic cable network in India. The increase in Content and other revenues primarily reflects higher licensing revenues, partially offset by lower home entertainment revenues.  

Adjusted Operating Income rose 5% ($88 million) to $1.9 billion, reflecting the higher revenues partially offset by increased expenses. The growth in expenses was mainly due to higher marketing and technology costs related to HBO NOW, HBO’s stand-alone streaming service, as well as higher programming costs, partially offset by lower restructuring and severance costs. Programming costs grew 3% reflecting higher original programming expenses, including programming charges.  

Operating Income increased 5% ($92 million) to $1.9 billion.  

In 2015, HBO and Cinemax added a total of 2.7 million domestic subscribers, including from HBO NOW. In 2015, HBO received a record 43 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most of any network for the 14th consecutive year, with Game of Thrones receiving 12 awards, a record for a series in one year, and Olive Kitteridge receiving eight awards, the second-most of any program. For the 88th Academy Awards, HBO received 3 nominations for Documentary (Short Subject).  

Fourth-Quarter Results  

Revenues increased 6% ($74 million) to $1.4 billion, due to increases of 3% ($37 million) in Subscription revenues and 20% ($37 million) in Content and other revenues. Subscription revenues grew primarily due to higher domestic rates, partially offset by lower international revenues, which included the impact of the transfer to Turner of the operation of HBO’s basic cable network in India. The increase in Content and other revenues primarily reflected higher international licensing revenues, partially offset by lower home entertainment revenues.  

Adjusted Operating Income was essentially flat at $393 million as the increase in revenues was offset by higher expenses. The increase in expenses was mainly due to higher programming costs as well as higher marketing and technology costs related to HBO NOW. Programming costs increased 11% primarily due to programming charges.  

6  

Operating Income was essentially flat at $393 million.  

WARNER BROS.  

Full-Year Results  

Revenues increased 4% ($466 million) to $13.0 billion, reflecting higher videogames and television revenues, partially offset by lower theatrical and home entertainment revenues as well as the impact of foreign exchange rates. The increase in videogames revenues was mainly due to the releases of Mortal Kombat X, LEGO Dimensions and Batman: Arkham Knight. Television revenues increased primarily due to higher licensing revenues, including from the domestic availabilities of 2 Broke Girls, The Big Bang Theory, Person of Interest, Friends and Seinfeld. Theatrical revenues declined as the prior year included revenues from the final two installments of The Hobbit trilogy as well as The LEGO Movie and Godzilla.  

Adjusted Operating Income increased 15% ($187 million) to $1.4 billion, reflecting higher revenues as well as lower restructuring and severance charges and related cost-savings.  

Operating Income increased 22% ($257 million) to $1.4 billion. The prior year included a $36 million foreign currency charge related to the remeasurement of Warner Bros.’ net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency and $41 million of asset impairments.  

Warner Bros. has over 65 series airing on television for 2015-2016 television season, including 32 primetime series on broadcast networks, the most of any studio for the 12th time in the past 13 seasons. Season-to-date among adults 18-49: Blindspot ranked as the #1 new series, The Voice ranked as the #1 non-scripted series and The Big Bang Theory ranked as the #1 comedy in primetime on broadcast television. In 2015, Warner Bros. ranked as the #3 U.S. videogame publisher producing two of the top ten titles and remained #1 domestically in overall home entertainment. For the 88th Academy Awards, Warner Bros. received 11 nominations, including a Best Picture nomination for Mad Max: Fury Road.  

Fourth-Quarter Results  

Revenues decreased 13% ($510 million) to $3.3 billion, mainly due to lower theatrical revenues, as the prior year quarter included the releases of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, Interstellar and Annabelle, as well as the impact of foreign exchange rates.  

Adjusted Operating Income decreased 5% ($18 million) to $373 million, due to the decline in revenues partially offset by lower restructuring and severance charges and theatrical valuation adjustments.  

Operating Income increased 15% ($47 million) to $366 million. The prior year quarter included the $36 million foreign currency charge and $36 million of asset impairments.  

CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME AND PER SHARE RESULTS  

Full-Year Results  

Adjusted EPS was $4.75 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $4.15 in 2014. The increase in Adjusted EPS primarily reflects higher Adjusted Operating Income and fewer shares outstanding, offset in part by higher taxes as a result of a $639 million net tax benefit in 2014, which was mainly related to the reversal of certain tax reserves in connection with an audit settlement.  

7  

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had Income from Continuing Operations of $3.8 billion, or $4.58 per diluted common share. This compares to Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner common shareholders in 2014 of $3.9 billion, or $4.41 per diluted common share.  

For both 2015 and 2014, the Company had Net Income of $3.8 billion.  

Fourth-Quarter Results  

Adjusted EPS was $1.06 for the three months ended December 31, 2015, compared to $0.98 in last year’s fourth quarter. The increase in Adjusted EPS primarily reflects lower taxes and fewer shares outstanding.  

For the three months ended December 31, 2015, the Company had Income from Continuing Operations of $857 million, or $1.06 per diluted common share. This compares to Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner common shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2014 of $720 million, or $0.84 per diluted common share.  

For the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, the Company had Net Income of $857 million and $718 million, respectively.  

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The Company utilizes Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Operating Income margin and Adjusted EPS, among other measures, to evaluate the performance of its businesses. These measures are considered important indicators of the operational strength of the Company’s businesses. Some limitations of Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Operating Income margin and Adjusted EPS are that they do not reflect certain charges that affect the operating results of the Company’s businesses and they involve judgment as to whether items affect fundamental operating performance.  

Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) is Operating Income (Loss) excluding the impact of noncash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets; gains and losses on operating assets (other than deferred gains on sale-leasebacks); gains and losses recognized in connection with pension and other postretirement benefit plan curtailments or settlements; external costs related to mergers, acquisitions or dispositions, as well as contingent consideration related to such transactions, to the extent such costs are expensed; amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations; and the foreign currency losses during the three months ended December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015, related to the translation of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency resulting from the Company’s change to the SICAD 2 exchange rate beginning December 31, 2014 and the Simadi exchange rate during the quarter ended March 31, 2015, respectively. Adjusted Operating Income margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income divided by Revenues.  

Adjusted EPS is Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. common shareholders with the following items excluded from Income from Continuing Operations attributable to Time Warner Inc. common shareholders: noncash impairments of goodwill, intangible and fixed assets and investments; gains and losses on operating assets (other than deferred gains  

8  

 on sale-leasebacks), liabilities and investments; gains and losses recognized in connection with pension and other postretirement benefit plan curtailments or settlements; external costs related to mergers, acquisitions, investments or dispositions, as well as contingent consideration related to such transactions, to the extent such costs are expensed; amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations; the foreign currency losses during the three months ended December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 related to the translation of net monetary assets denominated in Venezuelan currency resulting from the Company’s change to the SICAD 2 exchange rate beginning December 31, 2014 and the Simadi exchange rate during the quarter ended March 31, 2015, respectively; and amounts attributable to businesses classified as discontinued operations; as well as the impact of taxes and noncontrolling interests on the above items and the Company’s share of the above items with respect to equity method investments. Adjusted EPS is considered an important indicator of the operational strength of the Company’s businesses as this measure eliminates amounts that do not reflect the fundamental performance of the Company’s businesses. The Company utilizes Adjusted EPS, among other measures, to evaluate the performance of its businesses both on an absolute basis and relative to its peers and the broader market. Many investors also use an adjusted EPS measure as a common basis for comparing the performance of different companies.  

Free Cash Flow is defined as Cash Provided by Operations from Continuing Operations plus payments related to securities litigation and government investigations (net of any insurance recoveries), external costs related to mergers, acquisitions, investments or dispositions, to the extent such costs are expensed, contingent consideration payments made in connection with acquisitions, and excess tax benefits from equity instruments, less capital expenditures, principal payments on capital leases and partnership distributions, if any. The Company uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate its businesses and this measure is considered an important indicator of the Company’s liquidity, including its ability to reduce net debt, make strategic investments, pay dividends to common shareholders and repurchase stock.  

A general limitation of these measures is that they are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation and excluded items. Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the Company’s Operating Income (Loss), Diluted Income per Common Share from Continuing Operations and various cash flow measures (e.g., Cash Provided by Operations from Continuing Operations), as well as other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
