FARMINGTON, Conn., Jan. 27, 2016 - United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) today reported full year 2015 Adjusted EPS of $6.30. All results in this release reflect continuing operations unless otherwise noted.

“I’m pleased to report UTC’s 2015 earnings reached the top end of expectations we set months ago,” said UTC President and Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes. “Solid execution on our strategic priorities has set a strong foundation for future growth.”

“In line with our 2015 strategic priorities, we took decisive actions to streamline our portfolio with the divestiture of Sikorsky and return over $12 billion to shareowners. Returning cash to shareowners continues to be a top priority and we are still targeting $22 billion of total shareowner returns through share repurchases and dividends from 2015 through 2017,” Hayes said. “We also streamlined UTC’s organizational structure and initiated a $1.5 billion multi-year restructuring plan to improve competitiveness.” 

“UTC is now more focused than ever on innovative new technologies for the aerospace and buildings industries. This week Pratt & Whitney’s Geared Turbofan entered into service on the first A320neo - making aviation history by meeting all of its key performance requirements from day one,” Hayes added.

Full-year 2015 Adjusted EPS of $6.30 decreased 2 percent year over year, with foreign currency having an unfavorable impact of $0.19, or 3 percent. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, Adjusted EPS was up slightly year over year. GAAP earnings per share were $4.53, reflecting $0.31 in restructuring and $1.46 of net charges related to other significant non-recurring and non-operational items.

Full year sales of $56.1 billion decreased by 3 percent, as 1 point of organic sales growth was more than offset by 4 points of adverse foreign exchange. Free cash flow for the year was 126 percent of net income attributable to common shareowners, including slightly more than 25 points of benefit associated with restructuring and other significant items.

Fourth quarter Adjusted EPS of $1.53 was down 8 percent. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter reflected a loss of $0.30 per share, including $0.16 of restructuring costs and $1.67 of net unfavorable other significant items. Sales of $14.3 billion were down 5 percent driven primarily by 4 points of unfavorable foreign exchange, with organic sales up slightly in the quarter.

Otis new equipment orders in the quarter increased 2 percent over the prior year at constant currency, and grew 11 percent excluding China. Equipment orders at UTC Climate, Controls & Security decreased by 5 percent. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 11 percent at Pratt & Whitney, and up 8 percent at UTC Aerospace Systems. 

“As we enter 2016, the tough actions that we’ve taken, and will continue to take, put us in position to achieve our financial objectives. We remain confident in our full year 2016 Adjusted EPS expectations of $6.30 to $6.60 on sales of $56 billion to $58 billion, despite a difficult macro environment,” Hayes added.

UTC continues to anticipate 2016 free cash flow in the range of 90 to 100 percent of net income attributable to common shareowners. The company also continues to expect share repurchase of $3 billion in 2016, beyond the repurchases that will be completed in 2016 under the previously announced $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program. UTC continues to assume a $1 billion to $2 billion placeholder for acquisitions in 2016.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

Adjusted EPS, adjusted segment margins and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures that are used in UTC’s financial press releases and webcasts. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding amounts prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) is included in the tables to this press release. 

Adjusted EPS and adjusted segment margin reflect continuing operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and/or non-operational nature (often referred to in this press release as “other significant items”). Management believes Adjusted EPS and adjusted segment margin are both useful in providing period to period comparisons of the results of the Company’s operational performance. The tables attached to this press release provide additional information as to the items and amounts that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS and adjusted segment margin. 

Free cash flow represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow provides a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing UTC’s ability to fund its activities, including the financing of acquisitions, debt service, repurchases of the Company’s Common Stock and distribution of earnings to shareowners. 

When we provide our expectations for Adjusted EPS and/or free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, the closest corresponding GAAP measures (expected EPS from continuing operations and expected cash flow from operations) and a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectation and the corresponding GAAP measure generally are not available (except as otherwise indicated) without unreasonable effort due to potentially high variability, complexity and low visibility as to the items that would be excluded from the GAAP measure in the relevant future period. The variability of the excluded items may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP results. 

Adjusted EPS, adjusted segment margins and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate adjusted EPS, adjusted segment margins and free cash flow differently than the Company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparisons with such other companies.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(1)Adjusted Net Sales, Adjusted Operating Profit and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Net Sales represents Net Sales excluding significant items of a non-recurring and non-operational nature. Adjusted Operating Profit represents operating profit excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and non-operational nature. Adjusted EPS represents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and non-operational nature. Management believes Adjusted Net Sales, Adjusted Operating Profit and Adjusted EPS are useful in providing period to period comparisons of the results of the Company’s ongoing operational performance. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding amounts prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is included in the tables above.

(2)Debt to total capitalization equals total debt divided by total debt plus equity. Net debt to net capitalization equals total debt less cash and cash equivalents divided by total debt plus equity less cash and cash equivalents.

(3)Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the total reported increase within the Corporation's ongoing businesses less the impact of foreign currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures completed in the preceding twelve months and significant non-recurring and non-operational items. 

(4)Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow provides a useful measure of liquidity and an additional basis for assessing UTC's ability to fund its activities, including the financing of acquisitions, debt service, repurchases of UTC's common stock and distribution of earnings to shareholders. A reconciliation of net cash flow provided by operating activities, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, to free cash flow is provided above.

(5)Adjusted Net Sales, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EPS and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted Net Sales, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EPS and free cash flow differently than the Company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparisons with other companies.
