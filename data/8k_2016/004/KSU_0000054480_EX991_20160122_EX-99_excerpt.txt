Starling. “Despite these challenges, KCS attained a fourth quarter 2015 operating ratio of 63.4%, a 3.3 point improvement from the prior year. System velocity and system dwell metrics also improved, returning KCS to the top tier of Class I railroads in these categories.”

“Though our industry still must contend with economic uncertainty in 2016, the progress we have made during 2015 gives us confidence that KCS is positioned to maximize its near-term and longer-term business opportunities.”
