   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

EXPEDITORS REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 2015 EPS OF $0.61 PER SHARE 1 

SEATTLE, WASHINGTON - February 23, 2016, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) today announced fourth quarter 2015 financial results including the following highlights compared to the same quarter of 2014:

•Diluted Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders per share increased 20% to $0.61 

•Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders increased 15% to $114 million 

•Operating Income increased 13% to $178 million[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Revenues decreased (10)% to $1.6 billion

“As the strength of our results show, we have adapted well to a rapidly changing environment to produce net revenue yields that are among the best in our history," commented Bradley S. Powell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "We generated these strong results even though both air and ocean volume growth softened in the latter part of the year, and average sell rates came under pressure. Despite those dynamics, our people proved adept at taking advantage of opportunistic buy rates to increase operating profit and produce a fourth quarter operating income to net revenue margin in excess of 33%. In the fourth quarter, we continued to benefit from available ocean and air carrier capacity and favorable spot market buying opportunities, even as our revenues declined on lower average sell rates and volumes, as a result of slower market conditions. It’s no surprise that global uncertainty has made an increasingly interconnected marketplace more unpredictable, and we expect rate volatility to continue for some time. Looking forward, we are aware of the uncertainties and challenges with the global economy and global trade, and how they may impact the comparisons to our 2015 financial results.”

Jeffrey S. Musser, President and Chief Executive Officer, added, “The best year in the Company’s history doesn’t happen by accident. Throughout 2015, we further implemented our strategic plan to align more closely with opportunities and focus on growing our businesses. While we believe we benefited in the first half of the year from some unquantifiable increase in airfreight because of the West Coast labor dispute, we were adversely impacted by a softening in rates and volumes in the second half of the year. These shifting dynamics required our people to do what they do best, which is drive efficiency while providing the highest level of customer service. Through their efforts, we demonstrated how we are able to expand our margins by going after profitable business and gaining market share. I couldn’t be more proud of the energy and the entrepreneurial spirit at Expeditors. That culture has enabled us to grow and achieve a new Company best. We’ve grown deliberately and organically, investing in our people and our systems to make us more efficient and profitable than ever before in our history. I thank all of our employees for their dedication to making this our best year ever."

“This was also a year of record returns to shareholders,” Mr. Musser continued. “In 2015, we paid out more than $135 million in dividends and repurchased nearly $630 million in stock. Our disciplined business model, combined with the strength of our balance sheet, has given us the flexibility to invest in profitable growth while also returning capital to investors. While our first priority will always be investing for growth in our business, we are dedicated to accomplishing both.”

Net Revenues (Non-GAAP measure)

We commonly refer to the term “net revenues” when commenting about our Company and the results of its operations. Net revenues are a Non-GAAP measure calculated as revenues less directly related operations expenses attributable to the Company's principal services. We believe that net revenues are a better measure than are total revenues when analyzing and discussing our effectiveness in managing our principal services since total revenues earned as a freight consolidator include the carriers' charges to us for carrying the shipment, whereas revenues earned in other capacities include primarily the commissions and fees earned by us. Net revenue is one of our primary operational and financial measures and demonstrates our ability to concentrate and leverage purchasing power through effective consolidation of shipments from customers utilizing a variety of transportation carriers and optimal routings. Using net revenues also provides a commonality for comparison among various services. The following table presents the calculation of net revenues.
