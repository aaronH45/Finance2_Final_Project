COMERICA ADJUSTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2015 RESULTS

Revision Due to Recently Discovered Isolated Event Associated with Single Customer Loan

DALLAS/February 16, 2016 -- Comerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) today announced that it is adjusting its fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results, from those reported on January 19, 2016, as a result of recently discovered irregularities with a single customer loan relationship in the Retail Bank. Following the discovery, Comerica increased its provision for credit losses, recorded a charge-off for the amount in question, and decreased incentive compensation expense based on the revised results, effective as of December 31, 2015.

Comerica had approximately $26 million outstanding from an Arizona-based sales and appraisal company at December 31, 2015. Following an extensive analysis of the situation, Comerica has determined that there was significant doubt as to collectibility of the loan and, given the unique irregularities, it is believed to be an isolated incident.

Comerica Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ralph W. Babb, Jr. said, "Our investigation is ongoing and we are assessing all circumstances surrounding this matter. We remain confident in our systems and processes and will vigorously prosecute all legal options available to us to recover on this isolated loss." 

The adjustments will reduce Comerica's 2015 net income by $14 million after-tax, or 8 cents per share, from $535 million, or $2.92 per share, to $521 million, or $2.84 per share. Adjusted fourth quarter 2015 net income was $116 million, or 64 cents per share, compared to previously reported net income of $130 million, or 71 cents per share. 

The following table summarizes the impact of the adjustments on the previously reported financial results.

(a)Estimated as of January 19,2016. Prior to the adjustments, the final Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio would have been 10.56%.

Comerica’s Annual Report on Form 10-K will reflect these adjustments when it is filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The revisions primarily impacted the Retail Bank and Other Markets. Revised fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial information is included with this release.

(a) Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as defined by Basel I risk-based capital rules.

n/a - not applicable.

The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with Basel I risk-based capital rules in effect through December 31, 2014. Effective January 1, 2015, regulatory capital components and risk-weighted assets are defined by and calculated in conformity with Basel III risk-based capital rules. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders equity per share of common stock. Comerica believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.
