 Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

On January 12, 2016, American Tower Corporation (the “Company”) completed a registered public offering of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.300% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “2021 notes”) and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.400% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the “2026 notes” and, collectively with the 2021 notes, the “Notes”), which resulted in aggregate net proceeds to the Company of approximately $1,237.2 million, after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under its multi-currency unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in June 2013, as amended, and for general corporate purposes.  

The Company issued the Notes under an indenture dated as of May 23, 2013 (the “Base Indenture”), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of January 12, 2016 (“Supplemental Indenture No. 4” and, together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”), each between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The following description of the Indenture is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed provisions of the Indenture.  

The 2021 notes will mature on February 15, 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 3.300% per annum. The 2026 notes will mature on February 15, 2026 and bear interest at a rate of 4.400%. Accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes will be payable in U.S. Dollars semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2016. Interest on the Notes will accrue from January 12, 2016 and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The terms of the Indenture, among other things, limit the Company’s ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ abilities to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that the Company and its subsidiaries may incur liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, provided the aggregate amount of such liens shall not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Indenture.  

The Company may redeem the Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at its election at the applicable redemption price. If the Company redeems the 2021 notes prior to January 15, 2021 or the 2026 notes prior to November 15, 2025, the Company will pay a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If the Company redeems the 2021 notes on or after January 15, 2021 or the 2026 notes on or after November 15, 2025, the Company will pay a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date. In addition, if the Company undergoes a Change of Control and Ratings Decline, each as defined in the Indenture, the Company may be required to repurchase all of the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date.  

The Indenture provides that each of the following is an event of default (“Event of Default”): (i) default for 30 days in payment of any interest due with respect to the Notes; (ii) default in payment of principal or premium, if any, on the Notes when due, at maturity, upon any redemption, by declaration or otherwise; (iii) failure by the Company to comply with covenants in the Indenture or Notes for 90 days after receiving notice; and (iv) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries. If any Event of Default arising under clause (iv) above occurs, the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all the outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the entire principal amount on all the outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately.  

The foregoing is only a summary of certain provisions and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Base Indenture, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 23, 2013 as an exhibit to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-188812) and the Supplemental Indenture No. 4 by and between the Company and the Trustee, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1, and incorporated by reference herein.
