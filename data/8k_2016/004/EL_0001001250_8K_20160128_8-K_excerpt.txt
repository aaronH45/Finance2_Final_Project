ITEM 5.02(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. 

On January 28, 2016, the Stock Plan Subcommittee of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (the “Company”) granted John Demsey, Executive Group President, a long-term equity award under the Company’s Amended and Restated Fiscal 2002 Share Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). This summary is qualified in its entirety by the Performance Share Unit Award Agreement (including the Notice of Grant) (collectively, the “Agreement”) attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. 

This award is designed to further align Mr. Demsey’s interests with those of our stockholders and as an incentive for him to continue employment with us. The award has a potential payout equal to 71,694 shares of Class A Common Stock over three tranches (or 23,898 shares per tranche). The vesting date for the first tranche is January 29, 2018, the second tranche is January 29, 2019, and the third tranche is January 29, 2020. The aggregate grant date value of the three tranches is approximately $6.0 million, based on the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. 

No portion of the award will generally vest unless the Company has achieved positive Net Earnings for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. For purposes of the award, “Net Earnings” has the meaning used by the Company in its consolidated financials in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect on July 1, 2015. If Mr. Demsey voluntarily resigns or retires prior to the vesting of any tranche, the unvested tranche(s) will be forfeited regardless of whether he is retirement eligible. If Mr. Demsey’s employment is terminated without cause, then for each tranche that has not yet vested, he will earn and vest in the pro rata portion of such tranche, subject to actual achievement of the performance goal. If Mr. Demsey dies or becomes disabled, then for each tranche that has not yet vested, he will earn a pro rata portion of such tranche. Upon a change in control of the Company, the performance goal will be deemed to be met, and if the award is assumed, the award will only accelerate vesting upon a double trigger event. If the award is not assumed upon a change in control of the Company, the award will be settled immediately. Dividend equivalents will be paid out in cash in connection with shares that are earned.
