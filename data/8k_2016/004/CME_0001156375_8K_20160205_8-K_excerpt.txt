 Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

The information set forth under “Item 2.02. Results Of Operations and Financial Condition,” including the Exhibit attached hereto, shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.  

Attached and incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 99.1 is a copy of a press release of CME Group Inc. dated February 5, 2016, reporting CME Group Inc.’s financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2015.  

To supplement CME Group’s financial statements on a GAAP basis, the attached press release includes financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP, consisting of non-GAAP net income, earnings per share and adjusted operating expenses. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provide important supplemental information to management and investors about financial and business trends relating to CME Group Inc.’s financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provide a better measure of comparability with the Company’s prior financial reports. Management acknowledges that non-GAAP adjustments may include recurring items. These non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, CME Group Inc. has included a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the press release.  

 Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.  

A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.  

SIGNATURES  

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
