NEW YORK, February 4, 2016 – Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE / Euronext Paris: PM) today announced its 2015 full-year and fourth-quarter results. 

“PMI had an excellent year in 2015. Against a backdrop of improving industry volume trends in many key geographies, our cigarette brand portfolio performed superbly, driven by solid market share gains – underpinned by the successful roll-out of the Marlboro 2.0 Architecture – our enhanced commercial approach, and investments made in both 2014 and 2015 to support our business. Furthermore, our underlying financial results, underpinned by robust pricing, and our strong free cash flow, were equally impressive," said André Calantzopoulos, Chief Executive Officer.

“We continued to make exciting progress on the development, assessment and commercialization of our Reduced-Risk Products. We significantly expanded the roll-out of iQOS in Japan and introduced it into several new markets. We are well positioned to accelerate deployment in additional geographies this year."

"We enter 2016 with enhanced business fundamentals and ongoing strategic initiatives that will strengthen them further. While currency headwinds endure, we fully expect to continue to grow our business and generously reward our shareholders.”

2015 FULL-YEAR AND FOURTH-QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

In this press release, “PMI” refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries. References to total international cigarette market, defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the United States, total cigarette market, total market and market shares are PMI tax-paid estimates based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may, in defined instances, exclude the People's Republic of China and/or PMI's duty free business. "North Africa" is defined as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. "OTP" is defined as other tobacco products.  "EEMA" is defined as Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa and includes PMI's international duty free business. In the fourth quarter of 2015, to further align with the Member State composition of the European Union, PMI transferred the management of its operations in Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Slovenia from its Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa segment to its European Union segment, resulting in the reclassification of current and prior year amounts between the two segments. The reclassification was not material to the respective segments’ results. The term “net revenues” refers to operating revenues from the sale of our products, excluding excise taxes and net of sales and promotion incentives. Operating companies income, or “OCI,” is defined as operating income, excluding general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles, plus equity (income)/loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries, net. PMI's management evaluates business segment performance and allocates resources based on OCI. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items. Management also reviews OCI, OCI margins and earnings per share, or “EPS,” on an adjusted basis (which may exclude the impact of currency and other items such as acquisitions, asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items), as well as free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, and net debt. PMI believes it is appropriate to disclose these measures as they improve comparability and help investors analyze business performance and trends. Non-GAAP measures used in this release should be neither considered in isolation nor as a substitute for the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Comparisons are to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures, see the relevant schedules provided with this press release. "Reduced-Risk Products" (“RRPs”) is the term the company uses to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking cigarettes. PMI’s RRPs are in various stages of development and commercialization, and we are conducting extensive and rigorous scientific studies to determine whether we can support claims for such products of reduced exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke, and ultimately claims of reduced disease risk, when compared to smoking cigarettes. Before making

any such claims, we will rigorously evaluate the full set of data from the relevant scientific studies to determine whether they substantiate reduced exposure or risk. Any such claims may also be subject to government review and approval, as is the case in the United States today. Trademarks and service marks in this press release that are the registered property of, or licensed by, the subsidiaries of PMI, are italicized.

NET REVENUES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2015 Full-Year

Net revenues of $26.8 billion decreased by 10.0%. Excluding unfavorable currency of $4.7 billion and the impact of acquisitions, net revenues increased by 5.8%, driven by favorable pricing of $2.1 billion from across all Regions. The favorable pricing was partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix of $325 million, mainly due to Asia and Latin America & Canada.

2015 Fourth-Quarter

Net revenues of $6.4 billion declined by 11.2%. Excluding unfavorable currency of $1.1 billion and the impact of acquisitions, net revenues increased by 4.0%, driven by favorable pricing of $466 million from across all Regions. The favorable pricing was partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix of $175 million, mainly due to EEMA and Latin America & Canada, partially offset by Asia.

OPERATING COMPANIES INCOME

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2015 Full-Year

Reported operating companies income of $11.0 billion decreased by 9.1%. Excluding unfavorable currency of $2.4 billion and the impact of acquisitions, operating companies income increased by 10.8%, primarily driven by favorable pricing, as well as a favorable net comparison to asset impairment and exit costs in 2014, mainly related to the discontinuation of cigarette production in the Netherlands. Excluding the impact of these asset impairment and exit costs, operating companies income, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 6.6%, despite unfavorable volume/mix of $473 million, mainly due to EEMA, Asia and Latin America & Canada, and higher costs across all Regions. The higher costs principally related to: cigarette brand building initiatives, notably in France and Germany, Indonesia, Japan and North Africa, the global roll-out of the Marlboro 2.0 Architecture, and expenses 

- -4 -

related to the implementation of the EU Tobacco Products Directive in May 2016; business building and optimization initiatives, including the global roll-out of the enhanced commercial approach and new distribution models, notably in Canada and the United Kingdom; and increased investments behind the commercialization of Reduced-Risk Products, notably in the EU, Japan and Russia.

2015 Full-Year

The decrease in PMI's total cigarette shipment volume reflected declines in: Asia, mainly due to Korea, Pakistan and the Philippines, and in Latin America & Canada, mainly due to Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico.

Excluding the favorable net impact of estimated trade inventory movements, PMI's cigarette shipment volume declined by 2.9%, mainly reflecting market share loss, notably of: Marlboro, largely due to its price increase in the first quarter of 2015 to €5.20 per pack from its round retail price point of €5.00 per pack; and Philip Morris, including the morphed Diana that had been impacted by the growth of the super-low price segment; partly offset by super-low price Chesterfield.
