Commentary on Fiscal 2016 Second Quarter Financial Results

Global Payments delivered high-single digit normalized organic adjusted net revenue growth (on a constant currency basis), cash operating margin expansion (on a constant currency basis) and mid-teens cash earnings per share growth, despite significant negative impacts of foreign currency translation. Each of these accomplishments exceeded the company’s budget expectations and its stated cycle guidance. 

On December 15, 2015, the company provided the following fiscal 2016 second quarter financial results:

•Adjusted net revenue grew 5% to $518 million, compared to $494 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, or 12% on a constant currency basis. 

•Cash earnings per share grew 15% to $0.76, compared to $0.66 in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, or 29% on a constant currency basis.

•Cash operating margins were 29.6%, expanding 60 basis points on a constant currency basis year over year.

•GAAP revenues grew 4% to $722 million, compared to $697 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015, and GAAP earnings per share were $0.60, compared to $0.55 in the prior year.

Additional highlights for the quarter include:

North America

•North America Segment adjusted net revenue growth was 7% with cash operating income growth of 9%, including the effects of unfavorable currency trends in Canada. 

•Performance was driven by adjusted net revenue growth of 13% in the United States, reflecting high-single digit normalized organic growth from direct channels (including OpenEdge, which grew in the high-teens).

•Local currency growth in Canada was in line with the company’s expectations for the quarter, but was more than offset by the weak Canadian dollar which unfavorably impacted North America adjusted net revenue growth by 400 basis points. 

•Cash operating margins for North America expanded 50 basis points, or 150 basis points on a constant currency basis.

Europe

•Europe Segment adjusted net revenue growth was flat in U.S. dollars for the quarter on a year-over-year basis, but increased 12% on a constant currency basis. 

•Europe constant currency adjusted net revenue growth was driven by double-digit volume and transaction growth in Spain and mid-teens organic growth in the United Kingdom.

•Cash operating income grew 5% on a constant currency basis and cash operating margins declined for the quarter in line with the company’s expectations, largely due to the annualization of market-based pricing impacts in Spain. 

Asia-Pacific

•Asia-Pacific Segment adjusted net revenue grew 9% for the quarter, or 19% on a constant currency basis. 

•Normalized organic adjusted net revenue growth for Asia-Pacific was mid-single digits on a constant currency basis.

•Ezidebit, which annualized in the first half of the fiscal second quarter, produced over 20% organic revenue growth in local currency.

•Cash operating margins in Asia expanded 30 basis points, or 50 basis points on a constant currency basis.

NON-GAAP FINANICAL MEASURES

We supplement revenues, income, earnings per share information and cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP by providing income and related earnings per share on a “cash earnings” basis, Adjusted Net Revenue and Free Cash Flow in this document to assist with evaluating our performance. In addition to GAAP measures, management uses these non-GAAP measures to focus on the factors the company believes are pertinent to the daily management of our operations. Management believes Adjusted Net Revenue more closely reflects the economic benefits to the Company's core business and allows for better comparisons with industry peers. We believe Free Cash Flow is a useful measure of our ability to service debt, return capital to shareholders, invest in the business, and demonstrate value creation of our underlying operations. Management uses these non-GAAP metrics, together with other metrics, to set goals for and measure the performance of its business and to determine incentive compensation. Our Adjusted Net Revenue, income and earnings per share reported on a cash earnings basis and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, revenues, income, earnings per share and cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Our measures of Adjusted Net Revenue, income and earnings per share on a cash earnings basis and Free Cash Flow reflect management's judgment of particular items, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

Adjusted Net Revenue excludes gross-up related payments associated with certain wholesale lines of business to reflect economic benefits to the Company. On a GAAP basis, these payments are presented gross in both revenues and operating expenses. We define Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities, excluding the impact of changes in settlement assets and obligations, less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interests each of which is derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows. 

Income and the related earnings per share on a cash earnings basis exclude acquisition-related amortization expense, share-based compensation and certain other items specific to each reporting period as more fully described in the accompanying reconciliations in Schedule 7, Schedule 8 and Schedule 9. The tax rate used in determining the net income impact of cash earnings adjustments is either the jurisdictional statutory rate in effect at the time of the adjustment or the jurisdictional expected annual effective tax rate for the period, depending on the nature and timing of the adjustment.
