FLORHAM PARK, N.J. - Feb. 16, 2016 - Zoetis Inc. (NYSE: ZTS) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 and updated its guidance for full year 2016 and 2017.

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $22 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, a decrease of 83% and 84%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014; the significant decrease was primarily driven by charges related to changes in the company’s accounting for operations in Venezuela.

or $0.43 per diluted share, an increase of 5% and 8%, respectively. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 excludes the net impact of $192 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. On an operational basis, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 29%, with foreign currency having a negative impact of 24 percentage points. 

For the full year 2015, the company reported revenue of $4.8 billion, which is flat compared with the full year 2014. Revenue reflected an operational increase of 8%, with foreign currency having a negative impact of 8 percentage points. 

Net income for the full year 2015 was $339 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, decreasing 42% and 41%, respectively, compared to the full year 2014. Adjusted net income for the full year 2015 was $889 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, an increase of 13% compared with full year 2014.

EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY 

“In 2015, Zoetis continued to affirm our reputation as the global leader in the animal health industry with a strong financial performance, ongoing investments in our future growth, and a commitment to creating value for our customers and our shareholders,” said Juan Ramón Alaix, Chief Executive Officer at Zoetis. “In our three years as a public company, we have been delivering consistent operational revenue growth, and we expect our 2015 growth to show once again that we are growing faster than the industry.”

“We also grew our adjusted net income faster than sales as we focus on greater efficiency in our business,” continued Alaix. “We continue to have confidence in our end markets, business model, new product launches, improved product supply and progress toward our efficiency goals. Despite the negative impacts of foreign currency and Venezuela, we are pleased to reaffirm our 2016 and 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per share, which was updated in January to reflect the European Commission tax decision.”

“We delivered 6% operational revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which is particularly notable as compared against a strong fourth quarter of 2014,” said Paul Herendeen, Chief Financial Officer at Zoetis. “Our commitment to improving the efficiency of our operations - expenses 

2 |

were down 8% operationally in the quarter - enabled us to grow adjusted net income by 29% operationally.” 

“Our industry and our company continue to grow despite turbulence in parts of the global economy. For 2015, we delivered operational revenue growth of 8%, extending our history of growing faster than the animal health market,” said Herendeen. “The same drivers that made 2015 a financial success for Zoetis -- a resilient and growing animal health industry, new products, lifecycle innovations, business development activities and fast-paced improvements to our cost structure -- give us great confidence in our future.” 

QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTS

Zoetis organizes and manages its business across two regional operating segments: the United States (U.S.) and International. Within these segments, the company delivers a diverse portfolio of products for livestock and companion animals tailored to local trends and customer needs. In the fourth quarter of 2015:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Revenue in the International segment was $624 million, an increase of 3% operationally compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. Sales of companion animal products grew 6% operationally, led by increased availability of APOQUEL in the UK and other European markets, timing of buying patterns in Japan, and continued growth of vaccines in China. Sales of livestock products grew 2% operationally, led by growth in Brazil, Spain and Mexico. Growth in Brazil was due to strength in the cattle market and successful new product launches. Growth in Spain was driven by strong performance in swine, while growth in Mexico was due to performance of key brands in cattle and swine. Livestock growth in these markets was offset by business reductions in Venezuela and India, weakness in anti-infective sales in Western Europe, and unfavorable weather conditions in the UK.

Zoetis continues to drive demand and strengthen its diverse portfolio of products through lifecycle innovations, strong customer relationships and access to new markets and technologies. The company is focused on improving the performance and delivery of its current product lines; expanding product indications across species; pursuing approvals in new geographies; and developing innovative medicines, treatments and solutions for emerging diseases and unmet customer needs. Some recent highlights include:

•Zoetis received approval in the European Union and New Zealand for SIMPARICA™ (sarolaner), a new oral parasiticide for dogs that will help the company compete in the approximately $3 billion global market of flea and tick products. Zoetis is also on track 

3 |

for approval in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2016 and expects to launch there and in the EU at that time, with other global markets to follow. 

•Zoetis continued to broaden its innovative vaccine offerings for both companion animal and livestock as it strengthens its portfolio and focus on disease prevention. 

◦In November, the company was granted a conditional license from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to market Canine Influenza Vaccine, H3N2, Killed Virus, the first conditionally licensed vaccine to help control disease associated with canine influenza virus H3N2 (CIV H3N2). [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

◦Shortly after the company closed its deal in the fourth quarter to acquire PHARMAQ, the global leader in vaccines for aquaculture, one of their new vaccines for salmon received an emergency license in Chile, one of the world’s largest farmed fish markets.

•As part of bringing lifecycle innovation to its existing portfolio, Zoetis received approvals for new indications and formulations of key products.

◦In January, Zoetis received FDA approval for an update to the labeling for CERENIA® (maropitant citrate) Injectable, which allows for intravenous administration during surgical protocols, which use medication that induces vomiting. Previously approved only for subcutaneous injection, this CERENIA label update gives veterinarians the flexibility of an additional delivery option to help prevent vomiting in canine and feline patients.

◦The company also launched a new formulation of LUTALYSE®, a reproductive product for use in dairy and beef cattle, in the U.S. LUTALYSE HighCon is the first and only prostaglandin on the market approved by the FDA for subcutaneous administration in addition to intramuscular administration. This approval provides producers and veterinarians with flexible administration options while allowing them to abide by strict dairy and beef quality assurance standards.

FINANCIAL GUIDANCE 

Zoetis' guidance for the full year 2016 and the full year 2017 continues to reflect the company’s confidence in its diverse portfolio, the strength of its business model, and the stability and predictability of the animal health industry. The guidance includes the previously announced impact of the European Commission decision regarding Belgium tax rulings. 

Zoetis has also updated elements of its guidance today to reflect foreign exchange rates as of late January, changes related to the company’s accounting for its operations in Venezuela, and 

4 |

other operational views. Considering these factors, the company’s guidance for the full year 2016 and the full year 2017 is the following:

Full Year 2016:

•Revenue of between $4.650 billion to $4.775 billion

•Reported diluted EPS for the full year of between $1.30 to $1.48 per share 

•Adjusted diluted EPS for the full year between $1.71 to $1.81 per share

Full Year 2017:

•Revenue of between $4.950 billion to $5.150 billion

•Reported diluted EPS for the full year of between $1.95 to $2.13 per share 

•Adjusted diluted EPS for the full year between $2.18 to $2.32 per share

“Despite the continued negative impact of foreign currency since we provided guidance in November, we have been able to offset that impact on our adjusted diluted EPS, based on the strong momentum in our business, advancement of our R&D pipeline and successful execution of our efficiency plans,” said Paul Herendeen, Chief Financial Officer at Zoetis.

Additional guidance on other items such as expenses and tax rate is included in the financial tables and will be discussed on the company's conference call this morning.

Zoetis will host a webcast and conference call at 8:30 a.m. (EST) today, during which company executives will review fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, discuss 2016 and 2017 financial guidance and respond to questions from financial analysts.

2016 GUIDANCE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

A reconciliation of 2016 adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS guidance to 2016 reported net income attributable to Zoetis and reported diluted EPS attributable to Zoetis common shareholders guidance follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Reflects the impact of the European Commission decision regarding Belgium tax rulings, as announced in January 2016. The reported diluted EPS impact includes $55 million of one-time charges, in addition to the $65 million impact to adjusted net income.

(b)Reflects the impact of changes to foreign exchange rates underlying prior guidance and late January 2016 foreign exchange rates.

(c)Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are defined as reported U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income and its components and reported diluted EPS excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. Adjusted cost of sales, adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses, adjusted interest expense and adjusted other (income)/deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and, therefore, components of the overall adjusted income measure. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is defined as reported EBIT excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors.

Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. 

(d)Primarily includes certain nonrecurring costs related to restructuring and other charges for the operational efficiency initiative and supply network strategy, becoming an independent public company, such as new branding (including changes to the manufacturing process for required new packaging), the creation of standalone systems and infrastructure, site separation, and certain legal registration and patent assignment costs.
