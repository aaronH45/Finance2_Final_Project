Item 8.01 Other Events 

The Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp. subsidiary ("PWC") of United Technologies Corporation ("UTC") has entered into a series of amendments to certain research and development support arrangements previously entered into with Canadian federal and provincial government agencies. These amendments were signed on December 30, 2015. As a result of these amendments, UTC's Pratt & Whitney business unit recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately USD $870 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Under the amendments, PWC will make four annual payments commencing in January 2016 to fully settle and terminate PWC's contractual obligations to pay royalties to these agencies contingent upon future engine deliveries and company sales. The four payments, which include previously accrued amounts, will total approximately USD $965 million in the aggregate. PWC has also agreed to maintain its commitments to perform certain assembly, test and manufacturing operations in Canada and Quebec; and to spend approximately USD $8 million per year in support of innovation and research and development through initiatives with post-secondary institutions and key industry associations in Canada and Quebec over a fourteen year period. The aggregate amount of the four payments and the amounts PWC has agreed to spend in support of innovation, research and development initiatives is approximately USD $1.08 billion.
