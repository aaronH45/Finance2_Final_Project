Dublin, Ireland - February 18, 2016 - Perrigo Company plc (NYSE: PRGO; TASE) today announced results for the fourth quarter and calendar year ended December 31, 2015. 

Perrigo’s Chairman and CEO Joseph C. Papa commented, “The team delivered record performance in the face of a busy year and the challenges associated with an eight month long unsolicited takeover attempt. I would like to thank our Consumer Healthcare (“CHC”) and Rx teams for achieving all-time record net sales for the calendar year, and the Rx team for surpassing $1 billion in net sales. Since we closed the Branded Consumer Healthcare (“BCH”) acquisition, Euro net sales have improved year over year, due to some 

1

exciting new product launches and the acquisition of our new portfolio of leading OTC brands from GSK . Although the segment did not meet our internal expectations, we are taking specific actions to address this performance. We are confident that our durable business model and future growth prospects will continue to deliver value for our shareholders and provide Quality Affordable Healthcare Products® to our customers and patients worldwide.”

Refer to Tables I, II, III, and IV at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjustments to the current year and prior year periods and additional non-GAAP information. The Company’s reported results are summarized in the attached Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, which include selected balance sheet and cash flow data .

Net sales in the quarter were $1.42 billion, an increase of 33% on a reported basis.

Segment Results

Consumer Healthcare

Net sales in the fourth quarter were $710 million, a 6% increase on a constant currency basis, reflecting new product sales of $60 million and an increase in sales of existing products of $32 million (primarily in the infant formula, cough/cold and smoking cessation categories). These increases were partially offset by discontinued products of 

3

$47 million and a decline of $19 million in existing products (primarily in the analgesics and diabetes categories). Net sales were impacted by $10 million of unfavorable foreign currency movements. 

Record fourth quarter adjusted gross profit margin of 33.4% increased 140 basis points compared to last year primarily due to product mix, improved commodity costs and manufacturing efficiencies.

Adjusted operating income of $127 million in the fourth quarter improved $15 million, or 14%, compared to the prior year due to higher gross profit contribution and relatively flat operating expenses.

Branded Consumer Healthcare 

Net sales of $326 million in the fourth quarter included new product sales of $32 million, highlighted by the launch of Bronchostop® cough/cold syrup. Additionally, the Top 20 Brands grew 6% year-over-year. 

Fourth quarter adjusted gross profit percent to sales was 53.9% and adjusted operating income was $42 million, or 12.8%. 

Rx Pharmaceuticals

Net sales in the fourth quarter of $283 million, an increase of 2% over a record prior year, were driven by new product sales of $25 million, which were offset by a decrease in sales of existing products of $24 million. 

Fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $124 million decreased by 3% compared to the prior year, driven by a full quarter of investments in the specialty pharmaceuticals sales force this year and marketing costs. 

Specialty Sciences

The Company recognized $84 million of royalty revenue in the fourth quarter related to global sales of the Multiple Sclerosis drug Tysabri®. Net sales included $4 million in unfavorable foreign currency movements. 

Asset Impairment 

During the Company's impairment testing for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Company identified an impairment of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets based on management’s expectations for future revenues, profits and cash flows associated with these assets. The indefinite-lived intangible assets were purchased in conjunction with the Omega Pharma Invest NV acquisition and are included in the BCH segment. The assessment resulted in an impairment charge of $185 million, which represents the 

4

difference between the carrying amount of the intangible assets and their estimated fair value. The primary assumptions supporting the fair value of these assets and cash flow projections assume revenue growth based on the Company's best estimates for product line extensions, product life cycle strategies and geographical expansion within the markets in which the BCH segment currently distributes products, and gross margins and advertising and promotion investments largely consistent with historical trends.

In addition, the Company began actively marketing its India API business during the fourth quarter and recorded an impairment charge of $29 million related to the assets held for sale. 

Conclusion

Papa concluded, “Fourth quarter 2015 BCH financial performance was below our expectations. We are executing on our plan to drive improved BCH performance by taking select actions in the key areas of people, process, and products. First, we are changing the management structure of the BCH segment, incorporating Perrigo’s matrix leadership model in place, which will drive better transparency and accountability, sharpening our focus on performance metrics. Second we are improving our processes in order to align systems, connectivity and functional accountability of the BCH business to Perrigo standards - while continuing to leverage the powerful marketing platform that BCH has in place. Finally, we have conducted a portfolio review, and are taking actions in BCH to exit slower growing or underperforming brands to reallocate these resources to higher growth products. I am confident that these actions, when taken together, will result in improved operating performance and an acceleration of growth in the BCH segment. I want to stress our commitment and conviction around the long-term prospects for the BCH business and the European OTC marketplace as a whole.”

Guidance

Non-GAAP Measures 

This press release contains non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is included at the end of this press release. As a part of these non-GAAP measures, we report sales performance using the financial measure of "constant currency". We believe this provides meaningful information to assist our shareholders in understanding our financial results and true operational performance by assuming that foreign exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current period. The comparisons presented at constant currency reflect current year results translated at the prior year's exchange rates. This includes the royalty revenue related to Biogen Inc.'s sales of its Multiple Sclerosis drug Tysabri® included in the Specialty Sciences Segment.

A copy of this press release, including the reconciliations, is available on our website at www.perrigo.com.
