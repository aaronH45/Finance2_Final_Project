Indianapolis, Ind. – January 27, 2016 – Anthem, Inc. (NYSE: ANTM) today announced that fourth quarter 2015 net income was $180.9 million, or $0.68 per share. These results included net negative adjustment items of $0.46 per share.

Excluding the items noted in each period, adjusted net income was $1.14 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 38.7 percent compared with adjusted net income of $1.86 per share in the prior year quarter (refer to page 15 for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or “GAAP”).  

Full year 2015 net income totaled approximately $2.6 billion, or $9.38 per share, including net negative adjustment items of $0.78 per share. Full year 2014 net income was approximately $2.6 billion, or $8.99 per share, including net negative adjustment items of $0.36 per share. Excluding the items noted in each period, adjusted net income was $10.16 per share for the full year of 2015, an increase of 8.7 percent from $9.35 per share in 2014 (refer to page 15).  

“Our solid fourth quarter results reflected a continuation of our positive operating momentum as we ended the year serving 38.6 million members across our Commercial and Government markets. As we look ahead to 2016, we remain well-positioned to continue advancing affordability, quality and choice for our members. We believe our strategy will be enhanced with the pending acquisition of Cigna, which we continue to expect should close in the second half of 2016,” said Joseph Swedish, chairman, president and chief executive officer.

“We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and our full-year 2015 results of $10.16 in adjusted EPS. Our 2015 performance and favorable medical cost trends set a strong starting point for 2016,” said Wayne DeVeydt, executive vice president and chief financial officer. 

CONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS  

Membership: Medical enrollment totaled approximately 38.6 million members at December 31, 2015, an increase of approximately 1.1 million members, or 2.9 percent, from 37.5 million at December 31, 2014. Medicaid enrollment increased by 721,000 members and the Commercial & Specialty Business enrollment increased by 314,000 medical members as the Company experienced growth of 328,000 and 104,000 in the National and Local Group markets, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of 118,000 members in the Individual business. Enrollment also grew in the Medicare business and Federal Employee Program by 35,000 and 30,000, respectively.  

Medical enrollment decreased by 102,000 members, or 0.3%, sequentially during the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease reflected enrollment losses in the National and Individual businesses, partially offset by gains in the Medicaid business.  

Operating Revenue: Operating revenue was $20.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of approximately $1.2 billion, or 6.6 percent, versus the nearly $18.8 billion in the prior year quarter. The growth in revenue reflected premium increases to cover overall cost trends and higher enrollment in the Medicaid and Commercial self-funded businesses. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Local Group fully insured and Individual enrollment.  

Benefit Expense Ratio: The benefit expense ratio was 87.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 250 basis points from 84.5 percent in the prior year quarter. The increase was largely driven by an increase in the Individual and Local Group businesses, which included higher favorable prior period reserve development in the 4th quarter of 2014 than in the 4th quarter of 2015 and the timing of medical cost experience. The increase was partially offset by improved medical cost performance in certain markets in the Medicare business.  

Medical claims reserves established at December 31, 2014, developed moderately better than the Company’s expectation during 2015, which resulted in offsetting adjustments for the risk stabilization programs from Health Care Reform.  

Medical Cost Trend: For the full year 2015, underlying Local Group medical cost trend was at the lower half of our previously guided range of 6.5% - 7.5%. The Company anticipates that medical cost trends will be in the range of 7.0% - 7.5% in 2016.  

Days in Claims Payable: Days in Claims Payable (“DCP”) was 42.7 days as of December 31, 2015, an increase of 0.4 days from 42.3 days as of September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to changes in the timing of claims payments between periods.  

SG&A Expense Ratio: The SG&A expense ratio was 16.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 10 basis points from 16.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily driven by higher costs to support strong membership growth in 2015, partially offset by the impact of higher enrollment in the Medicaid business, which carries a lower average SG&A expense ratio than the consolidated company average.  

2  

Operating Cash Flow: Operating cash flow was $949.1 million, or 5.2 times net income in the fourth quarter of 2015, and approximately $4.1 billion, or 1.6 times net income for full year 2015. The Company’s 2015 results include the impact of approximately $500 million in timing items related to government and vendor payments. For 2016, the company expects operating cash flow to be greater than $3.0 billion, which includes the impact of the timing items referenced above.  

Share Repurchase Program: The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the pending acquisition of Cigna. During 2015, the Company repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares of its common stock, or 3.9 percent of the shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014, for $1.5 billion, or a weighted-average price of $145.50. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had nearly $4.2 billion of Board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining.  

Cash Dividend: During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.625 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $163.1 million.  

Investment Portfolio & Capital Position: During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded net realized gains on investments totaling $30.6 million and other-than-temporary impairment losses totaling $28.5 million. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company recorded net realized gains of $43.8 million, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairment losses totaling $13.5 million.  

As of December 31, 2015, the Company’s net unrealized gain position in the investment portfolio was $367.5 million, consisting of net unrealized gains on equity securities totaling $389.7 million and net unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities totaling $22.2 million. As of December 31, 2015, cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $1.4 billion.  

Discontinued Operations: In late December 2013, the Company entered into agreements to divest its 1-800 CONTACTS subsidiary and related assets. The sales were completed on January 31, 2014. As a result, the current and prior period operating results of 1-800 CONTACTS have been classified as discontinued operations, net of the related tax effects.

 (2)  “NM” = calculation not meaningful.  

Commercial & Specialty Business: Operating gain in the Commercial & Specialty Business segment totaled $55.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $483.7 million, or 89.7 percent, from $539.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease is a result of a higher benefit expense ratio in the Individual and Local Group businesses which included higher favorable prior period reserve development in the 4th quarter of 2014 than in the 4th quarter of 2015 and the timing of medical cost experience as well as fully insured membership declines. These declines were partially offset by enrollment growth in the self-funded businesses.  

Government Business: Operating gain in the Government Business segment was $417.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $62.9 million, or 17.7 percent, from $354.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was driven by improved medical cost performance in the Medicare business and enrollment increases in the Medicaid business.  

Other: The Company reported an operating loss of $33.8 million in the Other segment for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with an operating loss of $8.9 million in the prior year quarter.

Basis of Presentation  

 1. Operating revenue and operating gain, both non-GAAP measures, are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reporting segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain, is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense and selling, general and administrative expense. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains/losses on investments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management (refer to page 15 for the GAAP reconciliation tables).  

 2. Operating margin is defined as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Consolidated operating margin is a non-GAAP measure.  

 3. In late December 2013, Anthem, Inc. entered into agreements to divest its 1-800 CONTACTS subsidiary and related assets. As a result, the Company reclassified the current and prior period results of 1-800 CONTACTS as discontinued operations, net of the related tax effects. The 1-800 CONTACTS subsidiary and related assets sale was completed on January 31, 2014.
