Full Year Results

Full year revenues of $6,394 million increased $129 million, or 2%, compared to the prior year, as 6% growth at U.S. Networks was partially offset by a 2% decline at International Networks, primarily due to currency effects. Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization (“OIBDA”)(1) decreased 4% to $2,398 million, as 6% growth at U.S. Networks was more than offset by a 15% decline at International Networks, primarily due to currency effects, and a small operating loss at Education and Other. Excluding currency effects, total Company revenues and Adjusted OIBDA grew 10% and 4%, respectively, as changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced both revenue and Adjusted OIBDA growth by 8%. Excluding currency effects and the impact of the Eurosport acquisition(2), the SBS Radio disposition(3), and the consolidation of Discovery Family(4), total Company revenues and Adjusted OIBDA increased 6% and 3%, respectively.

Full year net income available to Discovery Communications, Inc. declined to $1,034 million ($1.58 per diluted share)(5) compared to $1,139 million ($1.66 per diluted share) for the full year 2014, primarily due to currency exchange rates, higher losses associated with the sale of businesses and lower equity earnings, partially offset by a decrease in taxes, restructuring costs and equity-based compensation. Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share ("Adjusted EPS")(1), which excludes the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, was $1.76 for the full year compared to $1.84 for full year 2014. Adjusted EPS increased 13% excluding currency effects, as changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced full year Adjusted EPS by 17%.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow

In addition to the results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) provided in this release, the Company has presented Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS and free cash flow. The Company evaluates the operating performance of its segments based on financial measures such as revenues and Adjusted OIBDA. Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income excluding: (i) mark-to-market equity-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) amortization of deferred launch incentives, (iv) restructuring and other charges, (v) certain impairment charges, (vi) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and (vii) certain inter-segment eliminations related to production studios.

The Company uses Adjusted OIBDA to assess the operating results and performance of its segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to each segment. The Company believes Adjusted OIBDA is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. The Company excludes mark-to-market equity-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, certain impairment charges, and gains and losses on business and asset dispositions from the calculation of Adjusted OIBDA due to their volatility. The Company also excludes depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of intangible assets and deferred launch incentives, as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. Additionally, certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. 

The Company defines Adjusted Net Income as net income available to Discovery Communications, Inc. stockholders excluding the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and defines Adjusted EPS as earnings excluding the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets per diluted share. Note that given the change in conversion ratio for our preferred stock, the preferred shares are now only included in the diluted share count. The Company believes Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are relevant to investors because these metrics allow them to evaluate the performance of the Company's operations exclusive of the non-cash amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets that impact the comparability of results from period to period.

The Company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less acquisitions of property and equipment. The Company uses free cash flow as it believes it is an important indicator for management and investors of the Company’s liquidity, including its ability to reduce debt, make strategic investments and return capital to stockholders.

Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures, and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, earnings per diluted share and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Please review the supplemental financial schedules beginning on page 12 for reconciliations to GAAP measures.
