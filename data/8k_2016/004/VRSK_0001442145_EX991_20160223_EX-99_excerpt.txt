Expenses and Adjusted EBITDA

Cost of revenues increased 10.4% in the fourth quarter and 11.3% for the full year compared with the respective prior-year periods, excluding second-quarter nonrecurring items related to the Wood Mackenzie acquisition. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to contributions from acquisitions and salaries and benefits to support business growth. Excluding acquisitions and prior-year pass-through costs in Healthcare, cost of revenues grew 1.0% in the quarter and 4.4% for the full year. The prior-year cost of revenues included $4.8 million of severance charges in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2014.

Selling, general, and administrative expense, or SG&A increased 47.2% in the quarter and 28.4% for the full year, excluding second-quarter nonrecurring items related to the Wood Mackenzie acquisition, primarily due to acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A decreased 0.4% for the fourth quarter and increased 0.8% for the full year as a result of increases in salaries and benefits to support growth in the business offset by decreases in third party costs and professional services fees.

Income from continuing operations increased 14.5% to $114 million in the fourth quarter and 36.9% to $508 million for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 22.5% in the quarter and 24.0% for the full year. Excluding acquisitions, second-quarter one-time items related to the Wood Mackenzie acquisition, and a $15.6 million gain on sale of third-party warrants, Adjusted EBITDA increased 6.9% in the quarter and 11.7% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 46.9% in the fourth quarter, up from 46.2% in the prior-year period. For the full year, Adjusted EBITDA margins were 48.1%, up from the prior year's 46.0%. Excluding the gain on sale of third-party warrants, Adjusted EBITDA margins were 47.4% for the full year.

The 30.8% increase in Decision Analytics Adjusted EBITDA to $161 million in the quarter was the result of acquisitions, growth in the business, and improved operations. Decision Analytics Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, excluding recent acquisitions, grew 3.7%. For the full year, Decision Analytics Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased 35.7%. Excluding acquisitions, Decision Analytics Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations grew 16.6% for the full year. 

The fourth-quarter 2015 Adjusted EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 11.4% to $102 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management, including the impact of lower costs resulting from the fourth-quarter 2014 talent realignment. For the full year, Risk Assessment Adjusted EBITDA grew 10.2% as a result of revenue growth, lower costs resulting from the talent realignment, and good cost management.

Adjusted EPS

GAAP diluted net income per share was $0.66 in the fourth quarter and $3.01 for the full year. Diluted adjusted earnings per share (adjusted EPS) were $0.80 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 23.1% compared with the same period in 2014. Diluted adjusted EPS were $3.09 for the full year, an increase of 28.8% compared with 2014. Adjusted EPS increased because of growth in operations, both organic and acquired, and lower taxes. The increases were partially offset by higher fixed asset depreciation and amortization expense and higher interest costs related to new debt issuance primarily related to the Wood Mackenzie acquisition.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, increased 33.5% to $458 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2015, including the contribution from acquisitions. This represented 46.0% of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. Capital expenditures increased 13.2% to $166 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Capital expenditures were 8.0% of revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.

Forward-Looking Statements

This release contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or to future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “target,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control and that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements.

Other factors that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements can be found in Verisk’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what we projected. Any forward-looking statement in this release reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, growth strategy, and liquidity. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Notes Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The company has provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding its operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income from continuing operations, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow, provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the company’s management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the company and for budgeting and planning purposes.

Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of our segments. In all periods shown here and going forward, the company defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as net income from 

6

continuing operations before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets and excluding second-quarter nonrecurring items related to the Wood Mackenzie acquisition.

Although securities analysts, lenders, and others frequently use EBITDA in their evaluation of companies, EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our statement of cash flow reported under U.S. GAAP. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with traditional U.S. GAAP operating performance measures as part of its overall assessment of company performance. Some of these limitations are as follows:

•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments.

•Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs.

•Although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

•Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of their calculations as comparative measures.
