Affirms 2016 guidance range 

MELVILLE, N.Y., February 10, 2016 – Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ: HSIC), the world’s largest provider of health care products and services to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners, today reported record fourth quarter financial results. 

Net sales for the quarter ended December 26, 2015 were $2.9 billion, an increase of 5.5% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. This consisted of 10.3% growth in local currencies and a 4.8% decline related to foreign currency exchange. In local currencies, internally generated sales increased 6.5% and acquisition growth was 3.8% (see Exhibit A for details of sales growth). 

Net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $129.9 million, or $1.56 per diluted share. Excluding restructuring costs of $12.4 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share, adjusted net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $139.3 million or $1.67 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 4.7% and 7.1%, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 (see Exhibit B for reconciliation of GAAP net income and EPS to non-GAAP adjusted net income and EPS). 

“We are delighted to report that sales growth during the fourth quarter was particularly strong, and we believe we gained market share on an overall basis during the quarter both in North America and internationally, as we successfully continued our long-standing strategy of organic growth complemented by strategic acquisitions. We are especially pleased with our worldwide internal sales growth in local currencies for the quarter of 6.5%, which represents the highest quarterly growth rate in eight years,” said Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein. “Adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.67. This caps off a successful 2015 performance with adjusted EPS growth for the year of nearly 10%, despite the continued negative impact from the strength of the U.S. dollar. We are pleased to affirm guidance for 2016 adjusted diluted EPS, which represents growth of 10% to 12% compared with 2015 adjusted diluted EPS.”

Dental sales of $1.4 billion increased 1.5%, consisting of 7.3% growth in local currencies and a 5.8% decline related to foreign currency exchange.

The 6.6% internal growth in local currencies included 7.6% growth in North America and 4.9% growth internationally. 

“We achieved local internal sales growth at multiyear high levels across our dental business – in North America, internationally and for the group as a whole. In North America, consumable merchandise internal sales growth in local currencies of 6.1% was particularly strong. Equipment sales and service internal sales growth in local currencies of 11.5% also was excellent and reflected strength in sales of traditional equipment,” commented Mr. Bergman. “International consumable merchandise internal sales growth in local currencies grew by 4.0%, led by the U.K. and France. International equipment sales and service internal growth in local currencies was a solid 7.0%, led by Germany, Australia, Austria and the U.K. During the fourth quarter, we acquired a 90% ownership in Dental Trey, which complements our existing business in Italy with a solid product offering and long-standing customer relationships. We also recently signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Dental Cremer, a distributor of dental supplies and equipment in Brazil.

We also acquired RxWorks, a practice management software company serving veterinarians in Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and the Netherlands.”
