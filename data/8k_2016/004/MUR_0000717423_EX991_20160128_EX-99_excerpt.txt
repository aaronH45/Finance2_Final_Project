   ·    Lowered G&A expense by approximately 16 percent year-over-year  

 FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  

 The net loss of $587.1 million, or $3.41 per diluted share, includes a non-cash impairment of oil and natural gas properties of $192.2 million, or $123.5 million net of taxes, as a result of further declines in market prices for future production since the end of third quarter. The non-cash property impairment primarily occurred at oil and natural gas fields in the deepwater Gulf of   

 1  

 Mexico. The net loss also includes deepwater rig contract exit costs of $282.0 million, or $183.3 million net of taxes. The two deepwater rigs that were under contract in the Gulf of Mexico were stacked before their contract expiration dates and the remaining obligations owed in 2016 under the contracts were expensed in 2015. The rigs were stacked due to a severe drop in commodity prices causing Murphy to plan for a significantly lower capital spending program in 2016, lack of partner support for continued drilling and no available farm-out opportunities. The net loss also includes recognition of a U.S. deferred tax charge of $188.5 million associated with a $2.0 billion distribution from a foreign subsidiary to the parent in December 2015. The distribution was paid in the form of $800.0 million in cash and the remainder through a 10 year note.  

 The net loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $583.2 million, or $3.39 per diluted share. The company reported an adjusted loss, which excludes both the results of discontinued operations and certain other items that affect comparability of results between periods, of $130.5 million, or $0.76 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2015. The company realized a hedging gain of $36.8 million before tax from settled crude oil contracts and natural gas forward sales in the fourth quarter of 2015. Details for fourth quarter can be found in the attached schedules.  

 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from continuing operations in the fourth quarter 2015 totaled a negative $122.0 million, or $6.41 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) sold, inclusive of the impact of the aforementioned $282.0 million in deepwater rig exit costs. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and exploration expenses (EBITDAX) in the fourth quarter 2015 totaled $97.1 million, or $5.10 per boe sold. Both EBITDA and EBITDAX were significantly impacted by a greater than 42 percent reduction in Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices between the comparative periods and the cost to exit two deepwater rig contracts in the Gulf of Mexico. Details for fourth quarter EBITDA and EBITDAX can be found in the attached schedules.  

 Fourth quarter 2015 production averaged nearly 200,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), slightly ahead of our 199,000 boepd guidance, primarily due to higher natural gas production from the Montney area in Western Canada and higher production in Malaysia for Sarawak natural gas. Details for fourth quarter production can be found in the attached schedules.  

 “Despite a major decline in oil prices, 2015 was a good year operationally for Murphy. We increased our proved reserves even with the inclusion of the 10 percent sell-down of our  

 2  

 Malaysian assets. The company’s year-end 2015 reserves to production ratio is 10.2, up from 9.2 a year ago. Our base production and type curves onshore in the Eagle Ford Shale and Montney continue to show strong performance to our original plans. Furthermore, service costs continue to decrease in the current commodity price environment,” stated Roger W. Jenkins, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We remain focused on driving down operating and G&A costs across all segments of our business. The cost reductions better position the company to weather the anticipated ‘lower-for-longer’ commodity price environment.”    

 2015 FINANCIAL RESULTS  

 For the year-ended December 31, 2015, Murphy reported a net loss of $2,270.8 million, or $13.03 per diluted share which includes non-cash impairments of oil and natural gas properties totaling $2,493.2 million, or $1,660.0 million net of taxes. The property impairments occurred at the Seal heavy oil field in Western Canada, and oil and natural gas fields offshore Malaysia and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The net loss also includes deepwater rig contract exit costs of $282.0 million, or $183.3 million net of taxes, and recognition of a U.S. deferred tax charge of $188.5 million associated with a distribution from a foreign subsidiary. Details on these adjustments are detailed in the fourth quarter financial results section. The company realized a hedging gain of $79.4 million before tax from settled crude oil contracts and natural gas forward sales in the full-year 2015.   

 The company reported an adjusted loss, which excludes both the results of discontinued operations and certain other items that affect comparability of results between periods, for the year-ended December 31, 2015 of $536.7 million, or $3.08 per diluted share.   

 EBITDA from continuing operations for the full-year 2015 totaled $948.1 million, or $12.38 per boe sold. EBITDAX for the same period totaled $1,419.0 million, or $18.53 per boe sold. Both EBITDA and EBITDAX were greatly impacted by a 47 percent decrease in Brent and WTI oil prices between the comparative periods and the deepwater rig contract exit costs. Details for year-to-date EBITDA and EBITDAX can be found in the attached schedules.   

 Production for the full-year 2015 averaged 207,903 boepd. Details for 2015 production can be found in the attached schedules.   

 OVERHEAD COST REDUCTIONS   

 Management has taken a proactive approach towards improving Murphy’s efficiency and structure in direct response to the low commodity price environment. Over the course of 2015,   

 3  

 the company announced and implemented key organizational changes including lowering staffing levels by over 20 percent and decreasing G&A expense by approximately 16 percent from 2014 levels, or $57.3 million. Full year benefits from these actions will be realized in 2016.

 2016 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND PRODUCTION GUIDANCE  

 Murphy is planning 2016 capital expenditures for operations to be $825.0 million, which is approximately 62 percent lower than the $2.19 billion spent in 2015. Approximately, 45 percent will be allocated toward offshore, 41 percent will be allocated toward the Eagle Ford Shale and 14 percent will be allocated toward Canada onshore. At this time, the capital program for 2016 remains under review for additional downward revisions should lower commodity prices persist.  

 Production for the first quarter 2016 is estimated in the range of 190,000 – 194,000 boepd with full-year 2016 production to be in the range of 180,000 to 185,000 boepd. Guidance can be found in the attached schedules.
