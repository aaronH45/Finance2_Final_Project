[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

3 Included in both the expense ratio and combined ratio is $5.0 million, or 7.2 points, of amortization/depreciation expense associated with the acquisition of a controlling interest in ARX Holding Corp. Excluding this additional expense and the actuarial adjustments taken during the month, the Property business would have reported a loss/LAE ratio of 55.6, an expense ratio of 26.9 and a combined ratio of 82.5 for December 2015. 

4Represents adjustments solely based on our actuarial reviews. In the Property segment, in addition to evaluating emerging claim data, ARX and its subsidiaries have been refining their analysis of their loss/LAE reserves based on the revised methodology that was implemented in conjunction with our review of the fair value of their loss/LAE reserves at the date of acquisition, which has created more variability in the monthly actuarial adjustments recorded this year.

Monthly Commentary

•Progressive operates on an accounting calendar that typically consists of a 52-week year, with 13-week quarters and a 4-week December. Under this calendar, we periodically recognize an additional week of activity, as was the case in 2014. Consequently, for 2014, our annual, fourth quarter, and December periods each include an additional week, which affects comparisons to the corresponding periods of 2015.

•On December 4, 2015, the Board of Directors declared an annual variable dividend to be paid on February 12, 2016, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 3, 2016 (ex-dividend date of February 1, 2016). The amount of the annual variable dividend is $0.8882 per common share, or an estimated $519.2 million in the aggregate, and is reflected in our 2015 financial statements. The annual variable dividend was calculated using the following formula, as specified by the Board in its December dividend declaration:

Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Statements in this release that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed herein. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, uncertainties related to estimates, assumptions, and projections generally; inflation and changes in economic conditions (including changes in interest rates and financial markets that affect the valuation of securities, including derivatives, in our portfolio); the possible failure of one or more governmental, corporate, or other entities to make scheduled debt payments or satisfy other obligations; the potential or actual downgrading by one or more rating agencies of our securities or governmental, corporate, or other securities we hold; the financial condition of, and other issues relating to the strength of and liquidity available to, issuers of securities held in our investment portfolios and other companies with which we have ongoing business relationships, including reinsurers and other counterparties to certain financial transactions; the accuracy and adequacy of our pricing, loss reserving, and reinsurance methodologies; the competitiveness of our pricing and the effectiveness of our initiatives to attract and retain more customers; our ability to obtain adequate reinsurance at acceptable rates and to collect under our reinsurance contracts; initiatives by competitors and the effectiveness of our response; our ability to obtain regulatory approval for the introduction of products to new jurisdictions, for requested rate changes and the timing thereof and for any proposed acquisitions; the effectiveness of our brand strategy and advertising campaigns relative to those of competitors; legislative and regulatory developments at the state and federal levels, including, but not limited to, matters relating to vehicle and homeowners insurance, health care reform and tax law changes; disputes relating to intellectual property rights; the outcome of litigation or governmental investigations that may be pending or filed against us; weather conditions (including the severity and frequency of storms, hurricanes, floods, snowfalls, hail, and winter conditions); changes in driving patterns, including vehicle usage as influenced by the level of oil and gas prices, among other factors; our ability to accurately recognize and appropriately respond in a timely manner to changes in loss frequency and severity trends; technological advances; acts of war and terrorist activities; our ability to maintain the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems, including protecting our information technology systems from cyber-attacks and other intrusions, and business functions, and safeguard personal and sensitive information and data in our possession; our continued access to and functionality of third-party systems that are critical to our business; court decisions, new theories of insurer liability or interpretations of insurance policy provisions and other trends in litigation; changes in health care and auto and property repair costs; and other matters described from time to time in our releases and publications, and in our periodic reports and other documents filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for one or more contingencies. Also, our regular reserve reviews may result in adjustments of varying magnitude as additional information regarding claims activity becomes known. Reported results, therefore, may be volatile in certain accounting periods.
