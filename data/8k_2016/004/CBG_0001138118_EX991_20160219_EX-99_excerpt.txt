Non-Gaap financial measures The following measures are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC guidelines: (i) Fee revenue (ii) Net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc., as adjusted (which we also refer to as “adjusted net income”) (iii) Diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. shareholders, as adjusted (which we also refer to as “adjusted earnings per share” or “adjusted EPS”) (iv) EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted (the latter of which we also refer to as “Normalized EBITDA”) None of these measures is a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use them in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Our management generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes, and the Company believes that these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. The Company further uses certain of these measures, and believes that they are useful to investors, for purposes described below. With respect to fee revenue: The Company believes that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the financial performance of our Occupier Outsourcing and Asset Services business lines and our business generally because it excludes costs reimbursable by clients and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business. With respect to adjusted net income, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA: The Company believes that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the accounting effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, and—in the case of EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA—the effects of financings and income tax and the accounting effects of capital spending. All of these measures may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. In the case of EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA, these measures are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use because they do not consider cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA measures calculated herein may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our credit facilities and debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments. The Company also uses Normalized EBITDA and adjusted EPS as significant components when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.

Footnotes Slide 16 Excludes global securities business. As of December 31, 2015. Slide 21 As of December 31 for each year presented. In Process figures include Long-Term Operating Assets (LTOA) of $0.1 billion for Q4 2015, $0.3 billion for Q4 2014, $0.9 billion for Q4 2013, $1.2 billion for Q4 2012 and $1.5 billion for Q4 2011. LTOA are projects that have achieved a stabilized level of occupancy or have been held 18-24 months following shell completion or acquisition. Pipeline deals are those projects we are pursuing which we believe have a greater than 50% chance of closing or where land has been acquired and the projected construction start is more than twelve months out. Slide 9 The base purchase price was $1.475 billion in cash plus approximately $36 million in estimated net adjustments for working capital and other items. Such net adjustments took into account approximately $45 million in cash acquired by CBRE in the acquisition. The purchase price is subject to post-closing adjustments as outlined in the purchase agreement for the transaction. Deal costs are excluded from the purchase price. Multiple based on GWS adjusted EBITDA as calculated by GWS (when owned by Johnson Controls) and using GWS’s methodologies (when owned by Johnson Controls) as well as previously announced run-rate cost synergies of approximately $50 million, which are expected to be fully realized in 2017. Slide 10 Other includes Development Services (1% in both 2006 and pro-forma 2015) and Other (1% in both 2006 and pro-forma 2015). Capital Markets includes Sales (33% in 2006 and 20% in pro-forma 2015) and Commercial Mortgage Services (4% in 2006 and 5% in pro-forma 2015). Contractual Revenues include Occupier Outsourcing and Asset Services (7% in 2006 and 32% in pro-forma 2015; excludes associated sales and lease revenues, most of which are contractual), Global Investment Management (6% in 2006 and 5% in pro-forma 2015), and Valuation (8% in 2006 and 6% in pro-forma 2015). Fee Revenue is gross revenue less client reimbursed costs largely associated with our employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients. Contractual plus leasing revenues are 64% of 2006 GAAP revenue and 78% of 2015 GAAP revenue. Slide 6 Normalized EBITDA excludes cost containment expenses, integration and other costs related to acquisitions and certain carried interest incentive compensation expense (to align with timing of associated revenue). Adjusted EPS excludes cost containment expenses (net of tax), amortization expense related to certain intangible assets attributable to acquisitions (net of tax), integration and other costs related to acquisitions (net of tax), certain carried interest incentive compensation expense (net of tax) and the write-off of financing costs (net of tax). Excludes the net impact of mark-to-market hedges and exchange rate transaction impact. NOTE: Local currency percent changes versus prior year is a non-GAAP financial measure noted on slides 6 and 11. These percent changes are calculated by comparing current year results versus prior year results, in each case at prior year exchange rates. Slide 11 We regard leasing revenue as largely recurring because unlike most other transaction businesses, leasing activity normally takes place when leases expire. The average lease expires in five to six years. This means that, on average, in a typical year approximately 17% to 20% of leases roll over and a new leasing decision must be made. When a lease expires in the ordinary course, we expect it to be renewed, extended or the tenant to vacate the space to lease another space in the market. In each instance, a transaction is completed. If there is a downturn in economic activity, some tenants may seek a short term lease extension, often a year, before making a longer term commitment. In this scenario, that delayed leasing activity tends to be stacked on top of the normal activity in the following year. Thus, we characterize leasing as largely recurring because we expect an expiration of a lease, in the ordinary course, to lead to an opportunity for a leasing commission from such completed transaction. Occupier Outsourcing and Asset Services revenue excludes associated leasing and sales revenue, most of which is contractual. Fee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients.
