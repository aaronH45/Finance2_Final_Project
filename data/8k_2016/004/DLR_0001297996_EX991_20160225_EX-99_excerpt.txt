DIGITAL REALTY REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 

AND FULL-YEAR 2015 RESULTS

San Francisco, CA -- February 25, 2016 -- Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE: DLR), a leading global provider of data center, colocation and interconnection solutions, announced today financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2015. All per share results are presented on a fully-diluted share and unit basis. 

Highlights[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Reiterated 2016 core FFO per share outlook of $5.45 - $5.60 and "constant-currency" core FFO per share outlook of $5.50 - $5.70

Financial Results

Digital Realty recognized total revenue of $500 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a 15% increase from the previous quarter and a 21% increase over the same quarter last year. For the full-year 2015, Digital Realty recognized total revenue of $1.8 billion, a 9% increase over the prior year. 

Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $288 million, a 15% increase from the previous quarter and a 19% increase over the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.0 billion for the full-year 2015, a 9% increase over 2014. 

Funds from operations (“FFO”) on a fully diluted basis was $118 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, or $0.79 per share, compared to $1.28 per share in the third quarter of 2015 and $1.40 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. FFO per share for the full-year 2015 was $4.85 compared to $5.04 in 2014. 

Excluding certain items that do not represent core expenses or revenue streams, core FFO was $1.38 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $1.32 per share in the third quarter of 2015, and $1.26 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. Core FFO per share for the full-year 2015 was $5.26 per share compared to $4.96 per share in 2014. 

Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $17 million, and net loss available to common stockholders was $40 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $0.28 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015 and net loss available to common shareholders of $0.39 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The net loss during the fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily attributable to the write-off of straight-line rent receivables related to Telx. For the full-year 2015, net income was $302 million and net income available to common shareholders was $217 million, or $1.56 per share, compared to $1.00 per share for 2014. 

Leasing Activity

“Data center demand remains steady, with new leases signed during the fourth quarter of 2015 representing $36 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue, including a $6 million contribution from Telx, the acquisition of which we completed in October,” commented Chief Executive Officer A. William Stein. 

“In addition to space and power, Telx also contributed $7 million of annualized interconnection revenue bookings during the fourth quarter. I am pleased with the rapid progress we have made towards integrating Telx, as well as the consistent execution we achieved in all areas of our business in 2015. The data center fundamental backdrop remains healthy, and particularly following the successful refinancing of our global credit facilities in January and corresponding extension of debt maturities, we are well positioned to continue to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns for shareholders.” 

The weighted-average lag between leases signed during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the contractual commencement date was 4.5 months. 

In addition to new leases signed, Digital Realty also signed renewal leases representing $29 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue during the quarter. Rental rates on renewal leases signed during the fourth quarter of 2015 rolled up 8% on a cash basis and up 19% on a GAAP basis.

The sale is expected to generate net proceeds of $35.8 million, and Digital Realty expects to recognize a gain on the sale of approximately $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. 

As previously announced, during the fourth quarter of 2015 Digital Realty acquired a 126-acre land parcel less than a mile away from its existing Digital Ashburn campus in Loudoun County, VA for a purchase price of $43 million. The site is expected to support the development of over two million square feet and the build-out of approximately 150 megawatts. Construction work is expected to begin in 2016, subject to market demand. Delivery will be phased to facilitate customer expansion requirements upon completion of the existing Digital Ashburn data center campus. 

Likewise during the fourth quarter of 2015, Digital Realty acquired a six-acre land parcel approximately three miles west of downtown Frankfurt, Germany for $6 million. The site is capable of supporting a 27 MW campus across three buildings, totaling 339,000 square feet. Timing and commencement of future development will be subject to market demand. 

Balance Sheet

Digital Realty had approximately $5.9 billion of total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015, comprised of $5.6 billion of unsecured debt and approximately $0.3 billion of secured debt.

2016 GuidanceFinancial Supplement

 Fourth Quarter 2015

2016 Outlook

Digital Realty reiterated its 2016 core FFO per share outlook of $5.45 - $5.60. The assumptions underlying this guidance are summarized in the following table. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Net non-cash rent represents the sum of straight-line rental revenue, straight-line rent expense as well as the amortization of above- and below-market leases (i.e., FAS 141 adjustments). 

(2)The "same-capital" pool includes properties owned as of December 31, 2014 with less than 5% of the total rentable square feet under development. It also excludes properties that were undergoing, or where expected to undergo, development activities in 2015-2016, properties classified as held for sale, and properties sold or contributed to joint ventures for all periods presented. 

Note: In an effort to make 2016 same-capital results comparable to 2015, projected Net Operating Income (NOI) includes intercompany activity related to legacy Telx leases at properties owned as of December 31, 2014 that meet the same capital definition. The intercompany activity will be eliminated to arrive at our consolidated financial results

(3)Other non-recurring CapEx represents costs incurred to enhance the capacity or marketability of operating properties, such as network fiber initiatives and software development costs. 

(4)Recurring CapEx represents non-incremental improvements required to maintain current revenues, including second-generation tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Capitalized leasing costs include capitalized leasing compensation as well as capitalized internal leasing commissions.

During the first quarter of 2015, we reduced the fair value of the earnout related to Sentrum by approximately $44.8 million.

Net operating income represents rental revenue and tenant reimbursement revenue from in-place leases, less rental property operating and maintenance expenses, property taxes and insurance expenses, and is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We caution you not to place undue reliance on our cash capitalization rates because they are based solely on data made available to us in the diligence process in connection with the relevant acquisitions and are calculated on a non-GAAP basis. Our calculation of the cash capitalization rate on acquisitions may change, based on our experience operating the properties subsequent to closing of the acquisitions. In addition, the actual cash capitalization rates may differ from our expectations based on numerous other factors, including the results of our final purchase price allocation, difficulties collecting anticipated rental revenues, tenant bankruptcies, property tax reassessments and unanticipated expenses at the properties that we cannot pass on to tenants.

•Digital Chicago Campus – 9333, 9355 and 9377 W. Grand Avenue, Franklin Park IL

Background

•In May 2012, Digital Realty acquired the three-building, 22-acre campus and created the Digital Chicago Campus.

•Based on strong demand for our Turn-Key Flex® data center product, as well as limited supply in the area, the first phase of construction began with the redevelopment of the 9333 W. Grand Ave. building in August 2012 to accommodate 117,515 square feet and provide 6.8 MW of IT Load.

•As market conditions continued to show limited supply of competitive space along with strong leasing activity in phase one, redevelopment of the 9355 W. Grand Ave. building commenced in June 2013 to accommodate 251,500 square feet and 14.4MW of IT Load in eight 1,800 kW data centers. 

•Two of the data centers in the 9355 Building were combined into one suite and the density was doubled to satisfy a customer's requirement thereby increasing the building's total IT Load from 14.4 MW to 18.0 MW.

Opportunity

•Upon completion, the Digital Chicago Campus will have development potential of 545,445 square feet to support upwards of 40.8 MW of IT Load. The Campus capacity will be increased as a result of increasing the density of the 9355 Building and increasing the IT Load Capacity of the 9377 Building from 12.8MW to 16.0 MW

•Campus utility service is provided by ComEd with 60 MW delivered by multiple 34.5kV services.

•The 9333 W. Grand Ave. building includes four Turn-Key Flex® data centers and is 91.7% leased based upon total IT Load.

•The second phase, 9355 W. Grand Ave., is currently under active redevelopment, with the first four 1,800 kW data centers completed and leased on the second floor. A fifth 2,400 kW data center is preleased and under construction and scheduled to be delivered 1Q2016. A 7,200 kW lease was signed in 4Q2015 for half of the first floor for delivery in 1Q2016 and 2Q2016. The remaining space on the first floor can accommodate 1,200 today or be expanded up to 4,800 kW upon specific customer demand. 

•The third phase is planned for a future ground-up development where the 9377 W. Grand Ave. building is sited today. The site is currently planned for a 176,730 square foot building to accommodate 16 MW of IT Load.

(1)IT Load MW Capacity represents UPS-backed power dedicated to Digital Realty's operated data center space and excludes any power associated with Powered Base Building and non-technical space. 

(2)Leased percentages include preleased space and will not necessarily be the same as occupancy percentages included in the Occupancy Analysis (pp.29-33) due to differences between lease execution and occupancy dates.

Funds from Operations (FFO): 

We calculate funds from operations, or FFO, in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, excluding a gain from a pre-existing relationship, impairment charges, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs’ FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. 

Core Funds from Operations:

We present core funds from operations, or core FFO, as a supplemental operating measure because, in excluding certain items that do not reflect core revenue or expense streams, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in our core business operating performance. We calculate core FFO by adding to or subtracting from FFO (i) termination fees and other non-core revenues, (ii) gain on sale of investment, (iii) significant transaction expenses, (iv) loss from early extinguishment of debt, (v) change in fair value of contingent consideration, (vi) equity in earnings adjustment for non-core items, (vii) severance accrual, equity acceleration, and legal expenses, (viii) bridge facility fees and (ix) other non-core expense adjustments. Because certain of these adjustments have a real economic impact on our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of core FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate core FFO in a consistent manner. Accordingly, our core FFO may not be comparable to other REITs' core FFO. Core FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.

Constant Currency Core Funds from Operations:

We calculate constant-currency core funds from operations by adjusting the core funds from operations for foreign currency translations. 

Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO): 

We present adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, as a supplemental operating measure because, when compared year over year, it assesses our ability to fund dividend and distribution requirements from our operating activities. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, AFFO will be used by investors as a basis to assess our ability to fund dividend payments in comparison to other REITs, including on a per share and unit basis. We calculate AFFO by adding to or subtracting from core FFO (i) non-real estate depreciation, (ii) amortization of deferred financing costs, (iii) amortization of debt discount/premium, (iv) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (v) non-cash stock-based compensation acceleration, (vi) straight-line rent revenue, (vii) straight-line rent expense, (viii) above-and below-market rent amortization, (ix) non-cash tax expense, (x) capitalized leasing compensation, (xi) recurring capital expenditures and (xii) capitalized internal leasing commissions. Other REITs may not calculate AFFO in a consistent manner. Accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs’ AFFO. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: 

We believe that earnings before interest expense, loss from extinguishment of debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and impairment of investments in real estate, or EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), are useful supplemental performance measures because they allow investors to view our performance without the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization or the cost of debt and, with respect to Adjusted EBITDA, change in fair value of contingent consideration, severance related accrual, equity acceleration, and legal expenses, transaction expenses, gain (loss) on sale of property, gain on sale of investment, gain on settlement of pre-existing relationship with Telx, other non-core expense adjustments, noncontrolling interests, and preferred stock dividends. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA excluding change in fair value of contingent consideration, severance related accrual, equity acceleration, and legal expenses, transaction expenses, gain (loss) on sale of property, gain on sale of investment, gain on settlement of pre-existing relationship with Telx, other non-core expense adjustments, noncontrolling interests, and preferred stock dividends. In addition, we believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are calculated before recurring cash charges including interest expense and income taxes, exclude capitalized costs, such as leasing commissions, and are not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of our business, their utility as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do; accordingly, our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to such other REITs’ EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our financial performance.

Net Operating Income (NOI) and Cash NOI:

Net operating income, or NOI, represents rental revenue and tenant reimbursement revenue less utilities, rental property operating expenses, repair and maintenance expenses, property taxes and insurance expenses (as reflected in the statement of operations). NOI is commonly used by stockholders, company management and industry analysts as a measurement of operating performance of the company’s rental portfolio. Cash NOI is NOI less straight-line rents and above and below market rent amortization. Cash NOI is commonly used by stockholders, company management and industry analysts as a measure of property operating performance on a cash basis. However, because NOI and cash NOI exclude depreciation and amortization and capture neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of NOI and cash NOI as measures of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate NOI and cash NOI in the same manner we do and, accordingly, our NOI and cash NOI may not be comparable to such other REITs’ NOI and cash NOI. Accordingly, NOI and cash NOI should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as measures of our performance.

Additional Definitions

Net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio is calculated using total debt at balance sheet carrying value less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents divided by the product of Adjusted EBITDA multiplied by four.

Debt-plus-preferred-to-total-enterprise-value is mortgage debt and other loans plus preferred stock divided by mortgage debt and other loans plus the liquidation value of preferred stock and the market value of outstanding Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. units, assuming the redemption of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. units for shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock.

Fixed charge coverage ratio is Adjusted EBITDA divided by the sum of GAAP interest expense, capitalized interest, scheduled debt principal payments and preferred dividends. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, GAAP interest expense was $62 million, capitalized interest was $3 million and scheduled debt principal payments and preferred dividends was $26 million.
