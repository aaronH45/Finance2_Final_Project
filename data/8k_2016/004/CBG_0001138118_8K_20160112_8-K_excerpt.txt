(d) On January 12, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) appointed Christopher T. Jenny to the Board and the Board’s Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, effective January 12, 2016, to serve until the Company’s 2016 annual meeting of stockholders. There is no arrangement or understanding between Mr. Jenny and any other person pursuant to which Mr. Jenny was selected as a director, and Mr. Jenny has not participated in any “related-party transactions” with the Company as set forth in Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. The Board has also determined that Mr. Jenny is “independent” as defined under New York Stock Exchange and Securities and Exchange Commission rules and guidance as well as under the Board’s Corporate Governance Guidelines and its Categorical Independence Standards.

We described this standard compensation package in our definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2015. He and the Company also entered into the Company’s standard form of Indemnification Agreement for members of its Board, which we previously filed as Exhibit 10.1 to, and described in, the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 8, 2009.
