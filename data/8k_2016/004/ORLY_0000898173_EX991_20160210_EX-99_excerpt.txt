Greg Henslee, O'Reilly's President and CEO, commented, "We are very pleased to once again report another very profitable quarter and a very strong finish to a record breaking year. Our Team's dedication to providing consistent, excellent customer service every day drove our very robust fourth quarter comparable store sales increase of 7.7%, which was on top of a strong comparable store sales increase of 6.3% in the fourth quarter of 2014. This industry leading comparable store sales performance represents our 9th consecutive quarter of comparable store sales growth greater than 5%, with increases of over 7% in each quarter of 2015. Our relentless focus on profitable growth translated our strong top line performance into a 24% increase in fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $2.19, which represents our 28th consecutive quarter of diluted earnings per share growth greater than 15%, and I would like to thank each of our Team Members for their continued hard work and commitment to our ongoing success."

Full-Year Financial Results

Sales for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased $751 million, or 10%, to $7.97 billion from $7.22 billion for the same period one year ago. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $4.16 billion (or 52.3% of sales) from $3.71 billion (or 51.4% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 12%.

ended December 31, 2015, increased to $2.65 billion (or 33.2% of sales) from $2.44 billion (or 33.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 9%. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased to $1.51 billion (or 19.0% of sales) from $1.27 billion (or 17.6% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 19%.

Diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2015, increased 25% to $9.17 on 102 million shares versus $7.34 on 106 million shares for the same period one year ago.

Mr. Henslee continued, "Team O'Reilly's dedication to unsurpassed service levels resulted in a full-year comparable stores sales increase of 7.5%, a record 19.0% operating margin and a 25% increase in full-year diluted earnings per share to $9.17, which represents our seventh consecutive year of 20% or greater annual diluted earnings per share growth. We are very proud of our record breaking 2015 financial results, as well as the addition of 205 net, new stores and the expansion into Connecticut, our 44th state, and we are intensely focused on extending our proven record of profitable growth in 2016. In the coming year, we expect to see continued strong demand in our industry, and more importantly, we remain very confident in our Team's commitment to providing consistently high levels of service to our customers. We will, however, face very difficult same store sales comparisons in each quarter of 2016, and based on these factors, we are establishing our first quarter and full-year 2016 comparable store sales guidance ranges at 3% to 5%. We will see a top-line benefit in 2016 from one additional calendar day, due to Leap Day in February; however, our comparable store sales guidance ranges for both the first quarter and full-year exclude this additional day."
