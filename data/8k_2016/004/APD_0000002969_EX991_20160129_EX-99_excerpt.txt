LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (January 29, 2016) – Air Products (NYSE: APD) today reported net income of $387 million and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.78, both up 15 percent versus prior year for its fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2015.  

On a GAAP basis, net income was $364 million and EPS was $1.67 for the quarter.  

First quarter sales of $2,356 million decreased eight percent from the prior year, as unfavorable currency and lower energy pass-through of five percent each more than offset volume and pricing increases of one percent each.  

Operating income of $519 million increased 17 percent versus prior year, and record operating margin of 22.0 percent improved 460 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA of $786 million increased nine percent over prior year, and record EBITDA margin of 33.4 percent improved 520 basis points. Profit improvement was driven by good cost performance and higher pricing.  

Commenting on the quarter, Seifi Ghasemi, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, “The Air Products teams around the world continue to execute our five-point plan and control what they can control, regardless of challenging economic conditions and currency headwinds. You can see their focus and commitment reflected in our very strong financial results, including EBITDA margin of 33.4 percent, up over 500 basis points, and return on capital employed of 11.7 percent, up 160 basis points.”

First Quarter Results by Business Segment:  

 •    Industrial Gases – Americas sales of $836 million decreased 17 percent versus prior year, as lower energy pass-through reduced sales by 12 percent and currency reduced sales by four percent. Volumes decreased three percent on lower demand in Latin America and weaker North American steel and oilfield services markets. Pricing increased two percent. Operating income of $212 million was flat to last year, and adjusted EBITDA of $335 million increased one percent, as higher pricing, restructuring benefits, and lower maintenance costs were offset by headwinds from currency, lower energy pass-through, and lower volumes. Operating margin of 25.3 percent improved 420 basis points, and EBITDA margin of 40.1 percent improved 700 basis points over prior year.  

 •    Industrial Gases – Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) sales of $438 million declined 12 percent versus last year, primarily driven by 10 percent unfavorable currency. Underlying sales were unchanged, as one percent higher pricing was offset by one percent lower volumes. Operating income of $92 million increased 13 percent from the prior year. On a constant currency basis, operating income was up 22 percent. Operating margin of 20.9 percent increased 470 basis points, and EBITDA margin of 33.3 percent increased 480 basis points over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA of $146 million increased two percent versus prior year. This profit improvement was driven primarily by the benefits of restructuring actions, as well as higher pricing.  

 •    Industrial Gases – Asia sales of $413 million increased four percent versus prior year, as volume growth of 11 percent, driven by both strong underlying business and new plants, was partially offset by six percent unfavorable currency. Operating income of $117 million increased 29 percent, and operating margin of 28.2 percent improved 550 basis points over prior year. Adjusted EBITDA of $180 million increased 16 percent, and EBITDA margin of 43.6 percent increased 480 basis points. This profit improvement was due to higher volumes and strong cost performance.  

 •    Materials Technologies sales of $490 million decreased six percent versus the prior year as positive pricing and mix of two percent was more than offset by six percent lower volumes and two percent unfavorable currency. Operating income of $127 million was up 22 percent from prior year, and operating margin of 26 percent was up 600 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA was $147 million, and EBITDA margin of 30.0 percent was up 530 basis points.  

   •    Electronic Materials sales of $245 million declined four percent from the prior year, as higher pricing and mix was more than offset by lower volumes and unfavorable currency. Excluding delivery systems, volumes would have been flat. Operating margin was up over 1,000 basis points, driven by higher pricing and mix and the benefits of restructuring actions.  

   •    Performance Materials sales of $245 million decreased nine percent from the prior year on lower volumes, unfavorable currency and lower pricing. Operating margin was up slightly, driven by lower raw material costs and the benefits of restructuring actions.  

In the first fiscal quarter of 2016, non-GAAP results for the Company exclude $14 million, or $0.05 per share, for project suspension costs and $12 million, or $0.06 per share, in legal and advisory fees related to the intended separation of the Company’s Materials Technologies business.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(Millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for share data)  

The discussion of first quarter results includes comparisons to non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP Capital Expenditures. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which management uses internally to evaluate our operating performance and manage our capital expenditures.  

We use non-GAAP measures to assess our operating performance by excluding certain disclosed items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business. We believe non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with meaningful information to understand our underlying operating results and to analyze financial and business trends. Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, should not be viewed in isolation, are not a substitute for GAAP measures, and have limitations which include but are not limited to:  

   •    Our measure excludes certain disclosed items, which we do not consider to be representative of underlying business operations. However, these disclosed items represent costs (benefits) to the Company.  

   •    Though not business operating costs, interest expense and income tax provision represent ongoing costs of the Company.  

   •    Depreciation, amortization, and impairment charges represent the wear and tear and/or reduction in value of the plant, equipment, and intangible assets which permit us to manufacture and/or market our products.  

   •    Other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.  

A reader may find any one or all of these items important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures by using them only to supplement our GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. In evaluating these financial measures, the reader should be aware that we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation in the future.

ADJUSTED EBITDA  

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (including noncontrolling interests) excluding certain disclosed items, which the Company does not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful metric for management to assess operating performance.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  

We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease.  

Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be approximately $1,300.  

OUTLOOK  

Guidance provided is on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the impact of certain items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business.

RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE)  

Return on capital employed (ROCE) is calculated as earnings after-tax divided by average total capital. Earnings after-tax is defined as operating income and equity affiliate income, after tax, at our effective tax rate. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income and taxes have been adjusted for the impact of the disclosed items detailed below. Total capital consists of total debt, total equity, and redeemable noncontrolling interest.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

(Unaudited)  

(Millions of dollars, unless otherwise indicated)  

1. MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES SEPARATION  

On 16 September 2015, the Company announced its intention to separate its Materials Technologies business into an independent publicly traded company. Subsequent to the satisfaction of specific conditions, the separation will be accomplished by distribution to Air Products shareholders of all of the shares of common stock of Versum Materials, LLC, or Versum, a newly formed company which will hold the Materials Technologies business. Versum is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and will be converted from a limited liability company to a Delaware corporation (Versum Materials, Inc.) prior to the distribution.  

During the first quarter of 2016, we incurred legal and other advisory fees of $12.0 ($.06 per share) related to the intended separation. Since the announcement, we have incurred $19.5 in separation fees. These fees are reflected on the consolidated income statements as “Business separation costs.” The results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows of the Materials Technologies business will continue to be presented within our consolidated financial statements as continuing operations until the Board of Directors approves the final separation and the separation occurs, at which time we expect the financial presentation of the historical results of this business will be reflected as a discontinued operation.  

2. PROJECT SUSPENSION COSTS  

Our Energy-from-Waste segment consists of two projects under construction in Tees Valley, United Kingdom, designed to process municipal solid waste to generate renewable power. In November 2015, the Company suspended construction of the second project until certain design issues of the first project are understood, remediated, and can be efficiently integrated into the design of the second project. During the three months ended 31 December 2015, we incurred incremental costs of $14.3 ($11.4 after-tax, or $.05 per share) to safely suspend construction activities of the second project. These costs are reflected on the consolidated income statements as “Project suspension costs.” We expect additional costs to be incurred in the second quarter.  

3. BALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATION OF DEFERRED TAXES  

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. As of the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we adopted this guidance on a retrospective basis. Accordingly, prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The guidance, which did not change the existing requirement to net deferred tax assets and liabilities within a jurisdiction, resulted in a reclassification adjustment that increased noncurrent deferred tax assets by $13.7 and decreased noncurrent deferred tax liabilities by $99.9 as of 30 September 2015.
