 On February 3, 2016, Accenture plc (“Accenture”) held its 2016 annual general meeting of shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”).

 The Amended 2010 SIP is substantially the same as the prior Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Share Incentive Plan, except that it has been amended to (1) authorize an additional 9 million shares, (2) establish limits on the total annual compensation granted to Accenture’s non-employee directors for any fiscal year and (3) make other amendments, as described in Accenture’s definitive proxy statement for the Annual Meeting filed on December 11, 2015 (the “Proxy Statement”).

 The Amended 2010 ESPP is substantially the same as the prior Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan, except that it has been amended to (1) authorize an additional 45 million shares and (2) make other amendments, as described in the Proxy Statement.

 The material terms of the Amended 2010 SIP and the Amended 2010 ESPP are described in the Proxy Statement, and the descriptions of the plans included in the Proxy Statement are incorporated herein by reference as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2. The descriptions of the Amended 2010 SIP and Amended 2010 ESPP are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the (1) Amended 2010 SIP, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1, and (2) Amended 2010 ESPP, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.2.

Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

 Requests to include shareholder-nominated director candidates in Accenture’s proxy statement for its 2017 annual general meeting of shareholders must be received by Accenture between July 17, 2016 and August 16, 2016.
