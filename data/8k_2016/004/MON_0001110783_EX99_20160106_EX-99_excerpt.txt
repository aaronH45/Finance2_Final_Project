MONSANTO COMPANY DELIVERS BETTER THAN EXPECTED FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS

•With recent currency devaluation in Argentina, company points to lower half of full-year ongoing EPS guidance of $5.10 to $5.60; full year as-reported guidance improves modestly to $4.12 to $4.79 as a result of the anticipated timing of charges related to announced restructuring actions

•Finalizes plans to reach previously outlined target of $500 million of annual savings by end of FY18

•Company targets ongoing and as-reported EPS CAGR in excess of 20% from end of FY16 to FY19 

•Industry-leading R&D pipeline delivers more than 20 advancements for third-consecutive year

ST. LOUIS, Jan. 6, 2016 - Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) delivered earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter ahead of expectations as operating expenses and soybean sales in Brazil both were better than original expectations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. In 2016, the company continues to execute on key initiatives within its core seeds and traits business led by new global corn hybrid portfolio introductions and continued significant Intacta RR2 PRO™ soybean adoption. Monsanto also remains disciplined in the execution of its Agricultural Productivity strategy, further optimization of spend and acceleration of progress toward its targeted capital structure. In its annual research and development (R&D) update today, the company will highlight more than 20 phase advancements across the industry’s broadest pipeline focused on helping farmers address current and future challenges.

“Through focus and discipline, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the targets and milestones we’ve established for our company in both the near term and through the next decade,” said Hugh Grant, chairman and chief executive officer. “In a challenging agriculture environment, we remain in a position of strength. It's this strength that positions us to be a leading partner in an industry that will continue to change."

“This is an exciting time in agriculture and within our company as we continue to expand the breadth and pace of innovation," said Robb Fraley, Ph.D., executive vice president and chief technology officer, regarding this year’s annual pipeline update. “We've seen incredible progress across our core pipelines of breeding, biotechnology and chemistry, along with our growth platforms of data science and biologicals. Through a truly integrated approach to delivering solutions, we are uniquely positioned to support farmers in their efforts to improve yields and overall productivity in a sustainable way."

Results of Operations

Net sales for the quarter decreased over the prior year’s first quarter to $2.2 billion. Gross profit on an as-reported basis for the 2016 first quarter also decreased over the prior year period to $901 million. As expected, the decline in the quarter is due to weaker foreign currencies, glyphosate pricing and lower corn volumes in Latin America.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs were $543 million and R&D expenses were $364 million for the quarter. Total operating expenses for the quarter, excluding pre-tax restructuring charges of $266 million, were nine percent lower than the prior year, mostly driven by currency. 

The company’s first quarter EPS was a loss of $0.11 on an ongoing basis, ahead of the company’s outlined guidance of a loss in the range of $0.23 to $0.33. This improvement was driven by lower than expected operating expenses and higher than expected Brazil Intacta RR2 PRO™ soybean results. The company’s first quarter EPS was a loss of $0.56 on an as-reported basis, which was better than its outlined guidance of a loss in the range of $0.86 to $1.13. As-reported results include $0.46 for restructuring charges, driven by the finalization of the company's plans to reach its previously outlined target of $500 million of annual savings by the end of fiscal year 2018. (For a reconciliation of ongoing EPS, see note 1.)

Cash Flow

Free cash flow was a source of more than $1.0 billion compared to a source of $969 million for the prior year first quarter, reflecting the disciplined reduction in inventory from the company's corn seed production plans and modest growth in its prepays in the United States. (For a reconciliation of free cash flow, see note 1.) Net cash provided by operating activities for the 2016 fiscal year first quarter was a source of $1.4 billion, compared to a source of $1.3 billion in the first quarter last year. Net cash required by investing activities for the first quarter of 2016 was $336 million, compared to $380 million for the same period of fiscal year 2015. Net cash required by financing activities for the first quarter of 2016 was $2.4 billion, compared to net cash required by financing activities of $107 million for the prior year’s first quarter. The increase in cash required by financing activities was driven by the initiation of the $3 billion accelerated share repurchase in the quarter. The program remains on track and is expected to close sometime in the next three months.

Outlook

With the anticipated continuation of several global and industry headwinds that include the recent currency devaluation in Argentina, Monsanto expects full-year ongoing EPS guidance to be at the lower half of the range of $5.10 to $5.60. Ongoing EPS guidance reflects in part an estimated $0.60 to $0.70 of headwinds from currency, greater than previous estimates of $0.35 to $0.40. Full-year EPS guidance on as as-reported basis improved modestly to $4.12 to $4.79 as a result of the anticipated timing of charges related to announced restructuring 

actions. With a focus on disciplined cash management, the company continues to project free cash flow in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion for fiscal year 2016. The company expects net cash provided by operating activities to be $2.6 billion to $3 billion, and net cash required by investing activities to be approximately $1 billion to $1.2 billion. (For a reconciliation of EPS and free cash flow, see note 1.)

The company now expects five to seven percent gross profit growth from its core Seeds and Genomics segment in fiscal year 2016. This growth is expected to be led by new global corn hybrid portfolio introductions, continued significant Intacta RR2 PRO™ soybean adoption and additional licensing opportunities in the range of $275 million. The company also expects the Agricultural Productivity segment to continue to deliver $900 million to $1.1 billion of gross profit in fiscal year 2016 as the company stays consistent with its strategy to maintain a slight premium over generics.

The company expects operating expenses for fiscal year 2016, exclusive of restructuring expense and environmental and litigation settlements, to be flat versus fiscal year 2015. This expectation is inclusive of new platform spend to support the long-term growth prospects for these opportunities.

Company executives reinforced today that a focus on key priorities and milestones in fiscal year 2016 is expected to set the foundation for rapid future growth. The company’s expanding core growth drivers and R&D leadership advantage, emergence of new platforms and financial discipline all underpin confidence in its growth target. The company expects innovation to drive 80 percent of the expected $3.5 billion in gross profit growth from the end of fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2019.

Seeds and Genomics Segment Detail

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(A) Fiscal first quarter 2016 seeds and genomics gross profit includes a pretax restructuring charge totaling $52 million related to certain asset impairment charges, primarily in the corn business, which is included in cost of goods sold.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Seeds and Genomics segment consists of the global seeds and related traits business, biotechnology platforms and digital agriculture. 

Sales for Monsanto’s Seeds and Genomics segment in the first quarter were $1.4 billion. The company continues to build on the momentum of Intacta RR2 PRO™ soybeans in South America as the company remains on track to reach its target of 30 million acres in fiscal year 2016. With its greater than four bushel per acre yield advantage and ability to reduce insecticide use, grower interest and adoption of the technology continues to grow. 

The company also is making progress on pre-commercial activities for its Roundup Ready 2 Xtend™ Crop System in soybeans, which is expected to be the largest biotech trait launch on more than three million acres in fiscal year 2016. In cotton, Bollgard II® XtendFlex™ is expected to reach 1.5 million acres in just the technology’s second year of commercialization. 

Through new hybrid portfolio introductions across key corn growing regions, Monsanto affirmed its intent to hold or grow share in every major corn market again in 2016, with germplasm price mix lift in the low single digit range in local currency.

Moving beyond seeds, as grower interest grows, Monsanto continues to expect the Climate platform to expand to more than 90 million acres in 2016 with more than 12 million of these acres using its premium offerings. 

Agricultural Productivity Segment Detail

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Agricultural Productivity segment consists of the crop protection products and lawn-and-garden herbicide products.

Segment sales for the first quarter reached $820 million. Monsanto continues to expect Agricultural Productivity segment gross profit to be in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2016 with the expectation that timing related declines in volumes from the first quarter will be recovered in the latter half of the year. The company continues to expect to sell approximately 300 million gallons of glyphosate for the full year at a premium close to that of generics.
