Reduced Risk Profile Expect substantially reduced volatility in credit performance in future cycles 18 Excerpts from Zions’ Corporate Policies Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs): “The Company’s CDO portfolio is a legacy asset that is in run-off and should be prudently managed down. No new CDO securities may be purchased, except in the event that an opportunity arises whereby the purchase of CDOs will result in a net decrease in the Company’s exposure to such securities, by for example, facilitating the disposition of a larger block of such securities held by the Company.” Structured Securities. “Structured securities other than CDOs, particularly those with any form of embedded leverage, pose particular credit, market and liquidity risks, and require detailed analysis. Generally, the purchase of such securities should be avoided, and a decision to make any such purchases requires approval of the management Enterprise Risk Management Committee in addition to ALCO prior to purchase” Safeguard against similar potential purchases– Chief Risk Officer Veto Power “Corporate Chief Risk Officer will serve as a member of ALCO with veto power over any ALCO decision” 0% 100% 200% 300% 400% 500% 2007 2015 CDOs & Construction and Land Development Loans, as a Percent of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ZION Peer Median • Zions has made strong strides in reducing assets that exhibit higher loss rates under economic stress • Zions’ exposure to CDOs and C&D loans moved from the high end of the peers to just slightly above the peer median • Policies in place make purchasing of structured securities in the future subject to a review of Zions’ Board of Directors 90% reduction for ZION Source: Zions and SNL Financial

Oil & Gas Portfolio Key Actions to Mitigate Risk 68 Following are representative key actions taken to mitigate risks in the O&G portfolio: – Active and regular discussions with borrowers about reduction of risk and deleveraging – Corporate Credit Risk in conjunction with Executive Management completing quarterly in person and intensive portfolio reviews and sensitivity testing. – Detailed review of O&G portfolio completed monthly by the Amegy team and Corporate Credit, including loan-level reviews, sensitivity analysis of significant borrowers and risk rating accuracy. – Developed several different analysis methods to estimate potential loss ranges based upon different potential levels of West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) oil prices per barrel. – Reduced O&G portfolio concentration limits from 100% of Bancorp Risk Based Capital to 85% with a target of 75% of Risked Based Capital. – Added additional staffing for upstream engineering (reporting to Credit) responsible for monitoring the engineering data provided to the bank by outside petroleum engineering consultant. – Heightened supervision related to potential Commercial Real Estate and Consumer knock-on risks.  

Agenda: Exploration & Production Executive Summary 69 • Multiple “haircuts” on oil / gas values and commodity prices to arrive at borrowing base. • Semi-annual borrowing base redeterminations and sensitivity testing to ensure proper equity cushion throughout the life of the loan. • The O&G price deck has been lowered nine times since December 2014, of which five were from 8/3/15 through 1/19/16, given rapidly changing oil and gas prices. • Collateral coverage remains acceptable. • Conservative underwriting at origination and active management through the redetermination process has assisted in managing risk.  

Example of Upstream (Reserve-Based) Underwriting 70 Typical Oil & Gas Reserve-Based Loan $100 - E&P company’s PV of oil & gas reserves using current NYMEX prices, discounted at a 9% rate (“PV9”) $ 90 - Apply “bank price deck” (generally ~90% of NYMEX) to determine collateral value. $ 77 - Zions’ risk-adjusted value of reserves (e.g. Zions applies discounts to non-producing reserves) $ 54 - Loan commitment amount (30% haircut if 25%+ of reserves are hedged) $ 46 - Loan commitment amount (40% haircut if less than 25% hedging) $ 30 - Loan balance outstanding amount (average of 60% in 2015) Note: Initial, unrisked collateral value is based on engineering firm assessment of oil/gas reserves. For lending purposes, no more than 25% of the collateral may be comprised of non-producing reserves. Cash flows from the reserves are calculated by employing engineer’s projected volumes, bank oil/gas price deck and actual operating costs, then converted to present value using a 9% discount rate.

Upstream Collateral Coverage Distribution Strong collateral coverage of upstream borrowers; built to withstand further shocks 72 • Upstream commitments reduced approximately 20% during 2015 due largely to the borrowing base redetermination process • Since 12/31/14 there have been six borrowing base deficiencies as a result of the borrowing base redetermination process • Three of these have been cured via company sale, debt reduction from cash flow or the pledge of additional collateral (letter of credit) • We have a high degree of confidence that two of the remaining three will be resolved by mid-2016 • One of the deficiencies may take longer to resolve; however, the borrower is cooperating and is willing to consider all options to resolve the deficiency • Generally speaking, borrowing bases have decreased less than the market may have expected • Although average oil prices fell ~50% in 2015, the impact has been offset by • Increased reserve additions, • Commodity hedging • Expense reductions (approximately 2/3 from service company price reductions, 1/3 from efficiency gains)  

Upstream Collateral Coverage Distribution Strong collateral coverage of upstream borrowers; built to withstand further shocks 73 • We use multiple discounts in our underwriting process. • Unrisked Reserves, Price-Deck Adjusted: Bank Price Deck applied to unrisked, proven oil and gas reserves. • Risked Reserves and Price-Deck Adjusted: Zions’ price deck applied to proven oil and gas reserves which have been adjusted to account for the uncertainty of new production volumes and the uncertainty of converting non- producing and undeveloped reserves to producing status. • While internal underwriting using Risk- Adjusted analysis may cause loans to be internally criticized or classified, on an un- risked basis collateral coverage exists. • Borrowers with satisfactory advance reserve-based loan advance rate may be classified due to higher overall leverage levels due to the presence of second lien or unsecured debt.

The Derivative Effect: Commercial Real Estate Limited expected NPAs or losses on Zions’ commercial real estate portfolio in Houston Key Risks: • Heightened supervision of 23 loans/$235MM in CRE balances among multifamily/office/hospitality in Houston, as follows: • 9 multi-family construction loans totaling $72MM • 5 office construction loans totaling $63MM and 1 office term loan totaling $4MM • 4 hotel construction loans totaling $59MM and 4 hotel term loans totaling $38MM • Stress testing for adverse impact results in grade migration and likely increases in criticized/classified loans, but still no meaningful increase in NPA is expected. • To date, no new credits added to criticized/classified status resulting from the energy sector. 84 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% <1.0 1-1.25 1.25-1.5 1.5-1.75 1.75-2 >=2 Current Houston Term CRE Debt Service Coverage Ratios Strong Cash Flow Coverage for the Houston Term CRE Portfolio  

The Derivative Effect: Commercial Real Estate Limited expected NPAs or losses on Zions’ commercial real estate portfolio in Houston Key Actions to Mitigate Risk: • Heightened supervision of the portfolio. The portfolio is monitored routinely for accurate Risk Grading, with more stress testing in 2016. • Construction for Houston assets curtailed in 4Q14, with negligible new construction loans in the Houston MSA since. • Amegy continues to sell down exposure on large credits, and seeks partners on new originations in all markets. • Actively manage the portfolio for covenant compliance (re-margin requirements, etc.) as most loans have ongoing Debt Coverage Ration/Debt Yield thresholds.

Economic Overview • Utah has the nation‘s most diverse economy 10 Most Diversified Economies in the Country: Hachman Index 2015 Source: Kem C. Gardner Institute Analysis of BEA data Note: A Hachman Index value of 100 means that the distribution of employment among industries is exactly the same as the nation. The closer the value to 100, the more diverse the state’s economy. 1  

Economic Overview • “… some places in the U.S., like Salt Lake City and San Jose, have mobility rates as high as anywhere else in the developed world. … So if you could figure out exactly what Salt Lake City is doing right, and apply that lesson elsewhere, you might be able to get people movin’ on up again.” - The New Yorker, “The Mobility Myth,” James Surowiecki • “Utah occupies the top spot for the fifth time in six years. The state has a very pro-business climate and companies benefit from energy costs that are 23% below the national average and fourth lowest in the U.S. Utah’s employment has expanded 2.2% a year over the past five years—third best in the U.S.” - Forbes, “Best States for Business,” October 2015 • “Utah is proof that if you pursue the right policies, take a balanced approach, and commit to working collaboratively, you can get results.
