on average common equity improved to 11.5% in 2015 from 10.0% in 2014. We increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 9% to $0.36 per share and repurchased 6.9 million shares during the year, returning $830 million in capital to our common shareholders.

Revenue growth of 9% in 2015 reflects significant increases in trust, investment and other servicing fees and net interest income. Expenses increased 5%, reflecting continued strong growth in our business and ongoing investments to support technology and regulatory initiatives,” said Frederick H. Waddell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

FOURTH QUARTER 2015 PERFORMANCE VS. FOURTH QUARTER 2014

Net income per common share was $0.99 in the fourth quarter of 2015, up from $0.98 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income was $239.3 million, compared to $244.0 million in the prior-year quarter. 

Revenue of $1.16 billion was up $26.6 million, or 2%, from $1.13 billion in the prior-year quarter. Noninterest income was $867.3 million, up slightly from the prior-year quarter’s $866.2 million, primarily reflecting higher trust, investment and other servicing fees, offset by lower foreign exchange trading income and other operating income as compared to the prior-year quarter. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis increased $25.1 million, or 9%, to $296.0 million compared to $270.9 million in the prior-year quarter, due to higher levels of earning assets and an increase in the net interest margin. 

Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $747.1 million, up $18.9 million, or 3%, from $728.2 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase primarily reflects new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates and equity markets.

FOURTH QUARTER 2015 PERFORMANCE VS. FOURTH QUARTER 2014 (continued)

Assets under custody and assets under management are the primary drivers of trust, investment and other servicing fees. The following table presents assets under custody and assets under management of Northern Trust's Corporate & Institutional Services (C&IS) and Wealth Management reporting segments.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

C&IS trust, investment and other servicing fees increased $18.4 million, or 5%, to $427.9 million from the prior-year quarter’s $409.5 million.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, increased 2%, driven by new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. Investment management fees increased 10%, primarily due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in C&IS totaled $7.8 million in the current quarter compared to $16.8 million in the prior-year quarter. Other fees in C&IS increased 19%, primarily related to higher sub-advisory fees.

FOURTH QUARTER 2015 PERFORMANCE VS. FOURTH QUARTER 2014 (continued)

Trust, investment and other servicing fees in Wealth Management totaled $319.2 million, relatively unchanged from $318.7 million in the prior-year quarter. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The increase in Wealth Management fees was primarily driven by new business and reduced money market mutual fund fee waivers, offset by unfavorable equity markets. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management totaled $12.7 million in the current quarter compared to $16.2 million in the prior-year quarter.

Foreign exchange trading income totaled $52.5 million, down $8.2 million, or 13%, compared with $60.7 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower client volumes. 

Security commissions and trading income totaled $18.5 million, down 11% compared to $20.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower transition management fees and referral revenue. 

Other operating income totaled $33.0 million, down $8.2 million, or 20%, from $41.2 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease primarily reflects a reduction of income associated with a third-party servicing agreement compared to the prior-year quarter. In addition, the current quarter includes a $25.9 million net gain on the sale of certain loans and leases, offset by a $27.0 million fair value adjustment on leases classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015, each of which is related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio. 

Net interest income on an FTE basis totaled $296.0 million, up $25.1 million, or 9%, compared to $270.9 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase is the result of higher levels of earning assets and an increase in the net interest margin. Earning assets for the quarter averaged $105.6 billion, up $6.2 billion, or 6%, from $99.4 billion in the prior-year quarter, primarily resulting from higher levels of securities and loans, reflecting an increase in total deposits and short-term

borrowings. The net interest margin increased to 1.11% from 1.08% in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher yields on earning assets. 

The provision for credit losses was a credit of $18.5 million in the current quarter, reflecting the adoption of a change in the estimation methodology for inherent losses and improved credit quality. The change in methodology resulted in a decrease in the estimate for the allowance for credit losses for the commercial and institutional loan portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit. There was a provision of $3.0 million in the prior-year quarter. Net charge-offs in the current quarter were $2.9 million, resulting from charge-offs of $5.2 million and recoveries of $2.3 million. The prior-year quarter included $5.4 million of net charge-offs, resulting from $8.2 million of charge-offs and $2.8 million of recoveries. Nonperforming assets decreased 19% from the prior-year quarter. Residential real estate loans and commercial loans accounted for 67% and 24%, respectively, of total nonperforming loans and leases at December 31, 2015.

The table below provides information regarding nonperforming assets, the allowance for credit losses, and associated ratios. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compensation expense, the largest component of noninterest expense, equaled $365.5 million, up $9.8 million, or 3%, from $355.7 million in the prior-year quarter, reflecting staff growth and base pay adjustments, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation accrued in the current quarter.

Employee benefit expense totaled $69.4 million, up $6.7 million, or 11%, from $62.7 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in pension and employee medical expense.

Expense associated with outside services totaled $155.1 million, up $11.9 million, or 8%, from $143.2 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting increased technical services expense and higher consulting expenses due to regulatory related spend, partially offset by lower third-party advisory fees. 

Equipment and software expense totaled $116.5 million, up $13.0 million, or 13% from $103.5 million in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter reflects higher software amortization and disposition costs.

Other operating expense totaled $74.5 million, up 5% from $71.1 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher staff-related and business promotion expenses. 

The provision for income taxes was $111.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of 31.7%. The current quarter includes a $5.5 million income tax benefit related to the decision to reinvest the pre-tax earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the United States.

RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED NET INTEREST INCOME TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT

Net interest income stated on an FTE basis is a non-GAAP financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. Management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income. The tables below present a reconciliation of interest income and net interest income prepared in accordance with GAAP to interest income and net interest income on an FTE basis.
