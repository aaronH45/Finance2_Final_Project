F5 Networks Announces Results for First Quarter of Fiscal 2016

SEATTLE, WA - January 20, 2016 - For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, F5 Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) announced revenue of $489.5 million, reflecting 6 percent growth from $462.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.

GAAP net income was $89.7 million ($1.28 per diluted share), compared to $89.1 million ($1.21 per diluted share) in the first quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased intangible assets, non-GAAP net income was $120.6 million ($1.73 per diluted share), compared to $114.2 million ($1.55 per diluted share) in the first quarter of last year.

A reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income is included on the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations.

“We continue to see growth in software sales, driven by strength in security modules and sales of our virtual editions,” said John McAdam, F5 president and chief executive officer. “Security remains a key driver of growth for the business, with million dollar plus security deals up year over year. In addition, our operating model continues to drive solid profitability and cash generation, with cash flow from operations at a record $204 million for the quarter.

“Over the medium to long term, we are confident the superior performance and breadth of functionality in our portfolio of hybrid solutions, including new BIG-IP appliances and VIPRION blades, as well as new security solutions and high performance versions of our software-only Virtual Editions, will spur the growth of product revenue in the second half of the fiscal year. Our confidence is backed by our annual survey (The State of Application Delivery in 2015) of more than 3,000 customers worldwide, published last week, which details how organizations use and plan to use our products to secure, optimize and deliver applications hosted on-premise and in public clouds. I am personally excited to be back at the helm during what I believe will be another inflection point in F5’s history as a growth company.”

GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation

F5’s management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is net income excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges, net of taxes, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure consists of GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges. This measure of non-GAAP net income is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the company’s tax liability. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that F5 has accounted for since July 1, 2005 in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 718 Compensation—Stock Compensation (“FASB ASC Topic 718”). Amortization of intangible assets is a non-cash expense. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contribute to revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to revenues in future periods. Acquisition-related expenses consist of professional services fees incurred in connection with acquisitions. 

Management believes that non-GAAP net income per share provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company’s core business operations and facilitates comparisons to the company’s historical operating results. Although F5’s management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the core business, management’s reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5’s earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5’s management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the company’s core business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP. 

F5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measure of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the company’s core business and which management uses in its own evaluation of the company’s performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the company provides investors this supplemental measure since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into the company’s operational performance and financial results. 

For reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see the section in our Consolidated Statements of Operations entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
