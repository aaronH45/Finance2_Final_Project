Notes to Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Earnings  

   •   For the fourth quarter 2015, the following items affected the comparability of results between periods: (i) charges of $33.9 million pre-tax for acquisition-related items including transaction costs, purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs; (ii) a charge of $4.5 million pre-tax related to an asset impairment; and (iii) charges of $14.5 million pre-tax for restructuring and productivity initiatives. The net effect of these items decreased net income by $28.3 million, or $0.37 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders. Amortization of intangible assets was $30.9 million pre-tax, which decreased net income on an adjusted basis by $20.5 million, or $0.27 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders.  

   •   For the fourth quarter 2014, the following items affected the comparability of results between periods: (i) net charges of $7.5 million pre-tax for acquisition-related items including purchased research and development, transaction costs, purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs; (ii) a credit of $3.5 million pre-tax related to the excise tax paid on U.S. medical device sales in 2013 associated with an agreement reached with the IRS during 2014; (iii) charges of $12.7 million pre-tax for litigation-related defense costs in connection with the District Court’s pre-trial orders that the company prepare 500 individual cases for trial (the “WHP Pre-Trial Orders”); and (iv) charges of $10.1 million pre-tax for restructuring and productivity initiatives. The net effect of these items decreased net income by $24.7 million, or $0.32 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders. Amortization of intangible assets was $29.1 million pre-tax, which decreased net income on an adjusted basis by $19.3 million, or $0.25 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders.  

   •   For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the following items affected the comparability of results between periods: (i) net charges of $31.7 million pre-tax for acquisition-related items including transaction costs, purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs; (ii) a charge of $4.5 million pre-tax related to an asset impairment; (iii) charges of $595.1 million pre-tax related to estimated costs for product liability matters (net of recoveries), which includes $15.1 million of litigation-related defense costs in connection with the WHP Pre-Trial Orders and other litigation-related charges; (iv) a gain of $210.5 million pre-tax related to a patent infringement litigation against W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc. (“Gore”); and (v) charges of $41.5 million pre-tax for restructuring and productivity initiatives. The net effect of these items decreased net income by $480.4 million, or $6.28 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders. Amortization of intangible assets was $119.5 million pre-tax, which decreased net income on an adjusted basis by $79.3 million, or $1.04 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders.  

   •   For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, the following items affected the comparability of results between periods: (i) net charges of $31.9 million pre-tax for acquisition-related items including purchased research and development, transaction costs, purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs; (ii) a credit of $3.5 million pre-tax related to the excise tax paid on U.S. medical device sales in 2013 associated with an agreement reached with the IRS during 2014; (iii) a charge of $6.2 million pre-tax related to an asset impairment; (iv) charges of $288.6 million pre-tax related to estimated costs for product liability matters, net of recoveries, which includes $30.1 million of litigation-related defense costs in connection with the WHP Pre-Trial Orders; (v) charges of $11.8 million pre-tax for restructuring and productivity initiatives; (vi) a gain of $7.1 million pre-tax related to the sale of an equity investment; and (vii) a decrease of $10.9 million in the income tax provision associated with the completion of IRS examinations for the tax years 2008 through 2010. The net effect of these items decreased net income by $291.5 million, or $3.72 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders. Amortization of intangible assets was $108.8 million pre-tax, which decreased net income on an adjusted basis by $72.4 million, or $0.92 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders.  

This press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the above tables.  

This press release includes net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company’s investors.  

In addition, this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: (1) cost of goods sold excluding the impact of acquisition-related items; (2) marketing, selling and administrative expense excluding charges for acquisition-related items and a credit related to the excise tax paid on U.S. medical device sales in 2013 associated with an agreement reached with the IRS during 2014; (3) research and development expense excluding charges for acquisition-related items and asset impairments; (4) other (income) expense, net, excluding acquisition-related items, litigation charges, net of recoveries (which includes litigation-related defense costs in connection with the WHP Pre-Trial Orders) and  

 other litigation-related charges, Gore proceeds, restructuring and productivity initiative costs, and gain on sale of investment; (5) income tax provision excluding a decrease associated with the completion of IRS examinations and the tax effect of the items set forth in (1) through (4) above; (6) net income excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above; and (7) diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders excluding the items set forth in (1) through (5) above and amortization of intangible assets.  

The company excluded the items described above because they may cause certain statements of operations categories not to be indicative of ongoing operating results, and therefore affect the comparability of results between periods. The company therefore believes that these non-GAAP measures provide an additional and meaningful assessment of the company’s ongoing operating performance. Because the company has historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community, management also believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors’ understanding of the company’s historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures: (1) to establish financial and operational goals; (2) to monitor the company’s actual performance in relation to its business plan and operating budgets; (3) to evaluate the company’s core operating performance and understand key trends within the business; and (4) as part of several components it considers in determining incentive compensation.  

Management recognizes that the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations, including the fact that they may not be comparable with similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies and that management must exercise judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP information. Management compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. All non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the above tables.
