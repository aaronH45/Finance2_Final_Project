(a)Effective January 1, 2015, contractual changes to a card program resulted in a change to the accounting presentation of the related revenues and expenses. The effect of this change was increases of $45 million and $48 million to both noninterest income and noninterest expenses in the fourth and third quarters of 2015, respectively.

(b)Basel III capital rules (standardized approach) became effective for Comerica on January 1, 2015. The ratio reflects transitional treatment for certain regulatory deductions and adjustments. For further information, see "Balance Sheet and Capital Management". Capital ratios for prior periods are based on Basel I rules.

(c)December 31, 2015 ratio is estimated.

(d)See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

"In 2015 we had good balance sheet growth as average loans topped $48 billion and average deposits grew to a record $58 billion,” said Ralph W. Babb, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "All the while, we are navigating our way through a modestly growing U.S. economy, as well as increased regulatory and technology demands. Credit quality continued to be solid, and while net charge-offs and the provision increased, they remain below normal historical levels. Through buybacks and dividends we returned $389 million or 73 percent of 2015 net income to shareholders. Both our book value and tangible book value per share increased 4 percent over the past year, as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value.

"With respect to the fourth quarter, revenue increased more than 2 percent. This was a result of growth in net interest income, which benefited from higher nonaccrual interest and the rise in rates late in the quarter, as well as an increase in fee generation, particularly commercial lending and card fees. Technology and regulatory costs drove noninterest expenses higher, as anticipated. Negative credit migration in our energy exposure continued as expected, while overall our customers have been acting prudently as evidenced by declining loan balances. The remainder of the loan book continues to perform well. We increased our share buyback to $65 million from the $59 million that was repurchased in each of the past six quarters. 

"As we look forward to the year ahead, we remain keenly focused on growing loans and deposits along with managing expenses as we make necessary investments. With the Federal Reserve increasing its benchmark rate 25 basis points in December, our revenue picture looks better, as our balance sheet remains well positioned to benefit from rising rates. With oil prices at a cyclical low, we have been closely monitoring our energy customers. In each quarter of 2015, we increased our reserves for energy and related loans(a). Well into the cycle, we continue to feel comfortable with our energy portfolio. In summary, we are committed to providing high quality financial services and building lasting customer relationships, which combined with our diverse geographic footprint, will continue to assist us in building long-term shareholder value."

(a) Loans related to energy at December 31, 2015 included approximately $3.1 billion of outstanding loans in our Energy business line as well as approximately $625 million of loans in other lines of business to companies that have a sizable portion of their revenue related to energy or could be otherwise disproportionately negatively impacted by prolonged low oil and gas prices.

Net Interest Income

COMERICA REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 2015 NET INCOME OF $130 MILLION - 4

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

◦Interest on loans increased $5 million, reflecting higher interest recognized on nonaccrual loans (+$6 million) and higher loan yields (+$3 million), partially offset by the impact of lower average loan balances (-$3 million) and a decrease in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio (-$1 million). [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

◦Interest on short-term investments increased $2 million, primarily reflecting an increase in average Federal Reserve Bank deposit balances.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income increased $6 million to $270 million in the fourth quarter 2015, compared to $264 million for the third quarter 2015. The increase primarily reflected increases of $8 million in commercial lending fees (primarily syndication agent fees) and $6 million in deferred compensation asset returns, partially offset by decreases of $4 million in warrant-related income and $3 million in hedge ineffectiveness income. The increase in deferred compensation asset returns was offset by an increase in deferred compensation plan expense in noninterest expenses.

Noninterest Expenses

Noninterest expenses increased $28 million to $489 million in the fourth quarter 2015, compared to $461 million for the third quarter 2015, primarily reflecting a $22 million increase in salaries and benefits expense, a $3 million increase in litigation-related expense, reflecting the release of reserves in the third quarter 2015, and smaller increases in several other categories, partially offset by a $3 million decrease in outside processing fees. The increase in salaries and benefits expense primarily reflected an increase in technology-related contract labor expense and higher staff insurance expense. Additionally, benefits in the third quarter 2015 from low deferred compensation expense and lower share-based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures were not repeated in the fourth quarter.

Credit Quality

“Net charge-offs were 21 basis points of average loans in the fourth quarter, remaining below historical normal levels,” said Babb. “Given persistently low oil and gas prices, we continue to see negative migration in the energy book, which has resulted in an increase in criticized loans, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. We have appropriately increased our reserves for energy and related loans in each quarter of 2015, and as of quarter end, our reserve allocation for energy and related loans was more than 4 percent of our total of these loans. Loans in our Energy line of business have declined by approximately $700 million from the February peak and, as of year-end, totaled about $3.1 billion, or about 6.25 percent of our total loans. Well into the cycle, we continue to feel comfortable with our energy and related exposure, and the remainder of the portfolio continues to perform well.”

Balance Sheet and Capital Management

Total assets and common shareholders' equity were $71.9 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2015, compared to $71.0 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2015.

There were approximately 176 million common shares outstanding at December 31, 2015. Share repurchases of $65 million (1.5 million shares) under the equity repurchase program, combined with dividends of 21 cents per share, returned 79 percent of fourth quarter 2015 net income to shareholders. Diluted average shares decreased 2 million to 179 million for the fourth quarter 2015.

The estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, reflective of transition provisions and excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), was 10.53 percent at December 31, 2015. Certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital began phasing in on January 1, 2015 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2018. The estimated ratio under fully phased-in Basel III capital rules is largely the same as the transitional ratio. Comerica's tangible common equity ratio was 9.72 percent at December 31, 2015, a decrease of 19 basis points from September 30, 2015.

Full-Year 2016 Outlook

For full-year 2016 compared to full-year 2015, management expects the following, assuming a continuation of the current economic and low-rate environment:

•Average loans modestly higher in line with Gross Domestic Product growth, reflecting a continued decline in Energy more than offset by increases in most other lines of business.

•Net interest income higher, reflecting the benefit from the December 2015 short-term rate increase, loan growth and a larger securities portfolio, more than offsetting higher funding costs.

•Provision for credit losses higher, with net charge-offs expected to increase but remain below historical normal levels.

•Noninterest income modestly higher, primarily due to growth in card fees from merchant processing services, government card and commercial card. Continued focus on cross-sell opportunities, including wealth management products such as fiduciary and brokerage services.

•Noninterest expenses higher, reflecting continued increases in technology costs and regulatory expenses, increased outside processing in line with growing revenue, higher FDIC insurance expense due to recent regulatory proposal, and typical inflationary pressures. Additionally, 2015 benefited from a $33 million legal reserve release which is offset by lower pension expense in 2016.

•Income tax expense to approximate 32 percent of pre-tax income.

The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Includes items not directly associated with the three major business segments or the Finance Division.

Business Bank

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Average loans decreased $431 million, primarily reflecting decreases in Mortgage Banker Finance, general Middle Market, Energy and Corporate Banking, partially offset by increases in Commercial Real Estate and National Dealer Services.

•Average deposits increased $341 million, primarily reflecting an increase in Corporate Banking, partially offset by decreases in Technology and Life Sciences and general Middle Market.

•Net interest income increased $7 million, primarily reflecting higher interest recognized on nonaccrual loans and higher loan yields, as well as an increase in net funds transfer pricing (FTP) credits, largely due to the increase in average deposits and an increase in the deposit crediting rate, partially offset by the impact of a decrease in average loan balances.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Noninterest income increased $2 million, primarily due to increases in commercial lending fees (primarily syndication agent fees), and card fees, partially offset by decreases in warrant-related income and customer derivative income.

•Noninterest expenses increased $8 million, primarily due to increases in corporate overhead expenses and salaries and benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in outside processing fees. The increase in corporate overhead expense was largely the result of increases in technology costs, regulatory expenses and staff insurance expenses in the fourth quarter that were allocated to the segments. Additionally, third quarter 2015 corporate overhead benefited from a release of litigation reserves.
