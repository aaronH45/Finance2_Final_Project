2016 Outlook Reflects Solid Underlying Demand and Pricing 

RALEIGH, North Carolina (February 9, 2016) – Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) today reported its results for the fourth-quarter and year-ended December 31, 2015. 

Ward Nye, Chairman, President and CEO of Martin Marietta, stated: “Our fourth-quarter performance established quarterly records for Martin Marietta’s net sales and profitability, driven by strong pricing, disciplined execution of our strategic plan and steady growth in general construction activity. Notably, all segments in the aggregates business delivered increased net sales and gross profit, while expanding gross profit margin. We exceeded our incremental gross margin target for heritage Martin Marietta businesses, as well as on a consolidated basis. The West Group led gross profit margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) expansion with a 630-basis-point improvement, largely the result of strong pricing and realized synergies from the TXI acquisition. Importantly, we achieved these consolidated results despite heightened and sustained adverse weather trends that constrained both shipments and efficient production. 

“The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has tracked precipitation levels for 121-years, and the fourth quarter was the wettest, at both the national level and in our key states of Texas, North Carolina and South Carolina, in their history. Similarly, Iowa and Georgia experienced their second and third wettest recorded periods, respectively. These conditions significantly constrained construction and related activity, which led to lower-than-expected shipment and production volumes during the quarter. However, our unrelenting focus on operational excellence and cost discipline, coupled with strong pricing in the Aggregates business, led to attractive margin expansion and earnings growth.  

“For the full-year 2015, we achieved record net sales and profitability, expanded consolidated gross profit margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) by 260 basis points, and exceeded both incremental margin targets for the consolidated heritage businesses and acquisition synergy targets ahead of the expected timeline. In addition, we invested strategic capital in our business, completed several bolt-on acquisitions and returned nearly $630 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

“We continue to execute against our strategic objective of securing and solidifying leading market positions in economically-diverse, high-growth areas. To that end, in November 2015, and last week, we closed two acquisitions near Colorado Springs, Colorado that complement our position in metro-Denver and northern Colorado, collectively the Front Range. The Front Range runs north-south along the Interstate 25 corridor, and over 80 percent of Colorado’s population lives in this area. These two businesses add nearly one billion tons of aggregates reserves and will serve as a high-quality source of construction aggregates to a market transitioning from rapidly depleting alluvial reserves. Coupled with our existing operations, these transactions secured an estimated 100 years of aggregates reserves in the Front Range.   

“Our outlook for 2016 reflects growing underlying demand and strong pricing across our entire geographic footprint. National employment growth, a stimulus for construction activity, remained robust throughout 2015, surpassing the pre-recession peak by nearly five million jobs. These job gains, in addition to substantial contractor backlogs resulting from historic rainfall in 2015, should fuel growth and further recovery of the U.S. construction industry.”  

Mr. Nye continued, “In addition to job growth, positive private sector construction activity and favorable population dynamics in our key markets, we now have a multi-year federal highway bill for the first time in a decade. The five-year, $305 billion Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, or FAST Act, provides the funding certainty states have needed to commit to much-needed longer-term projects to improve America’s transportation network. We believe the FAST Act, coupled with state-level funding initiatives in four of our top five states, namely Texas, North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa, will drive large, multi-year, aggregate-intensive construction projects. Further, it is also likely we will see meaningful projects in rural areas of those states that have been infrastructure-starved during the last decade and will now be better able to develop new avenues for growth and commerce. We are well positioned, through our leading market positions and strong foundation, to capitalize on these opportunities and enhance long-term shareholder value.”

OPERATING RESULTS (All comparisons are versus the prior-year period, unless noted otherwise) 

Aggregates Business  

Aggregates Shipments by End-Use 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For the full year, shipments to the infrastructure market increased five percent in 2015. The growth reflects state-level funding initiatives positively impacting Texas, Iowa, Georgia and Florida. Major infrastructure activity is accelerating at the state-level and, when combined with the FAST Act, will likely increase the rate of infrastructure growth, the duration of the projects and the mix of aggregate-intensive new construction for 2016 and beyond. As one example, shortly after passage of state funding initiatives, the North Carolina Department of Transportation announced an accelerated schedule for 90 highway projects already included in the state’s strategic transportation improvement plan. 

The nonresidential market represented 32 percent of fourth-quarter and full-year aggregate product line shipments and increased three percent for full-year 2015. Light nonresidential construction increased approximately 27 percent for the year, following growth in residential demand and driven by construction activity across all geographies, offsetting a reduction in direct energy shipments into the shale fields. For the year, we shipped 3.6 million tons to the shale fields compared with 7.5 million tons in 2014. 

The residential end-use market aggregates product line shipments increased 20 percent for the full-year 2015, reflecting the continued steady recovery of residential investment. Florida, Colorado and North Carolina each rank in the top-ten states in housing starts. At the metro-level, particular strength is seen in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas illustrating the resilience and diversity of the Texas economy. In addition, strength is seen in Atlanta, Georgia, indicative of the continuing recovery in the Southeastern United States. Aggregate product line shipments to the ChemRock/Rail market increased nine percent in 2015.  

Heritage aggregates product line shipments increased two percent for both the fourth-quarter and full-year 2015. Geographically, heritage aggregates product line shipment gains were led by volume growth in the Southeast Group, where increasing demand throughout Georgia and Central Florida drove a 6.5 percent increase in shipments for the full year. Aggregates product line shipments in the Mid-America Group for 2015 increased five percent. West Group shipments declined by three percent for the year 2015, driven largely by historic rainfall in Texas and Oklahoma, a reduction in shale energy volumes, and the required divestitures related to the TXI acquisition in the third quarter of 2014.

February 9, 2016 

Heritage aggregates product line pricing increased in each reportable group in both the fourth-quarter and full- year 2015, led by the West Group’s 12 percent improvement for the quarter and 11 percent improvement for the full year.  

The heritage ready mixed concrete product line reported robust pricing and volume improvements in 2015. The Company leveraged a five percent volume increase and a ten percent price increase to expand gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) by 220 basis points. The acquired ready mixed concrete business pricing increased nearly 11 percent, reflective of both underlying demand and the expiration of certain TXI project commitments included in 2014 results. Ready mixed concrete shipments increased to 4.6 million cubic yards, but fell below expectations, principally due to adverse Texas weather conditions. 

On a consolidated basis, full-year total production cost per ton shipped for the aggregates product line increased 1.5 percent. The cost per ton reflects lower energy costs offset by higher operating expenses associated with poor weather, most visible in lower productivity per man hour.  

Incremental gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) for the heritage aggregates business exceeded targeted objectives for both the fourth-quarter and full-year 2015. The incremental gross margin of 82 percent for the full-year 2015 was led by growth in both the West Group and the Southeast Group, which achieved incremental gross margin of 135 percent and 78 percent, respectively. The heritage Aggregates business gross margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) was 23.8 percent for the full-year 2015, an increase of 480 basis points. 

Magnesia Specialties Business 

Magnesia Specialties business net sales were negatively affected by a slowdown in the steel industry and declined $9 million, or four percent, for the year. Steel capacity utilization was approximately 71 percent for the year, down from 78 percent for 2014. The business generated $228 million in net sales and a 35 percent gross profit margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues) for the full-year 2015. 

Cement Business 

With the sale of the California cement business in September 2015, fourth-quarter results are not comparable with the prior-year period. Cement shipment volume and net sales declined 371,000 tons and $32 million, respectively, for the quarter related to the California divestiture.  

While 2015 volumes are not comparable due to the California disposition, the Company is encouraged by the continued resilience in the Texas markets, with increasing demand driven by solid population and employment growth. The Portland Cement Association (PCA) forecasts modest demand growth in Texas in 2016, followed by stronger growth in 2017, all underscoring a continued favorable supply/demand imbalance over the next several years.

February 9, 2016 

The remaining cement business continues to benefit from significant pricing improvement throughout Texas, although fourth-quarter volumes were adversely affected by weather conditions. Average selling prices were up ten percent, reflective of the impact from the expiration of legacy TXI cement contracts with below-market pricing in addition to the sale of the lower average priced California cement operations. The business generated $60 million of net sales in the quarter and $22 million in earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, depletion and amortization (EBITDA), a 37 percent EBITDA margin. For the year, the cement business generated $368 million in net sales and delivered a 28 percent gross profit margin (excluding freight and delivery revenues), a 310-basis-point improvement over the prior year. For the full year, EBITDA for the business increased to $101 million. 

Consolidated Operating Results 

SG&A expenses for full-year 2015 were 6.7 percent of net sales, and 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter. The increase of 40 basis points for the full year, and 90 basis points for the fourth quarter, reflects higher pension expense, increased incentive compensation costs (related to performance against strategic, financial and operating objectives) and continued investment in information systems improvements.  

Other operating expenses, net, for the full-year was $15.7 million in 2015 compared with other operating income of $4.6 million in the prior-year. The decrease is due to the $24.3 million pre-tax loss on the sale of California cement operations, partially offset by the $13.1 million pre-tax gain on the divestiture of the San Antonio asphalt operations. Full-year earnings from operations were $479.4 million in 2015 compared with $314.9 million in 2014.  

The Company’s effective income tax rate for full-year 2015 was 30 percent, in line with the Company’s guidance. Cash taxes for the full year were $46 million, which reflects consideration of deferred income taxes and the utilization of an estimated $476 million of net operating loss carryforwards. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Cash provided by operating activities for 2015 was $573.2 million compared with $381.7 million in 2014, principally attributable to higher earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and the absence of TXI transaction costs incurred in 2014.  

Capital investment for the full-year 2015 was $318 million, which includes $78 million related to the new Medina limestone quarry near San Antonio. The rail-connected quarry became operational on January 1, 2016 and ships aggregates products to South Texas, including Houston, and will be an important source of high-quality Department of Transportation specification aggregates.  

At December 31, 2015, the ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined, for the trailing twelve months was 1.9 times, in compliance with the Company’s leverage covenant.  

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM 

The Company is authorized to execute a share repurchase program under which it may acquire up to 20 million shares of its outstanding common stock. Repurchases are expected to be carried out through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated share purchase transactions, or any combination of such methods. The Company expects to complete the repurchase program over the next several years, though the actual timing of completion will be based on an ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of the Company’s

common stock and general market conditions. Share repurchases will be executed based on then-current business and market factors; therefore, the actual return of capital in any single quarter may vary. The repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued by the Board at any time without prior notice.  

During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1,698,000 shares of its common stock for $262 million. For the full-year 2015, the Company repurchased 3,285,000 shares of its common stock for $520 million. As of December 31, 2015, there were 64.5 million shares of Martin Marietta common stock outstanding.  

“I am very pleased with our 2015 performance and achievements, notwithstanding the extraordinary weather challenges that temporarily suppressed our growth trajectory. The backlog of construction projects, coupled with meaningful state department of transportation initiatives and passage of the FAST Act should provide substantial growth opportunities in 2016 and beyond. We remain committed to our core pillars – world-class safety, ethical conduct, our people, sustainability, operational excellence, cost discipline and customer satisfaction – with the goal of continuing to reward our shareholders for their investment in Martin Marietta,” concluded Mr. Nye.

FULL-YEAR 2016 OUTLOOK 

“Based on current forecasts and indications of market activity, we remain positive about the outlook of our business in 2016. Aggregates product line pricing is expected to increase from six to eight percent. Volume growth is expected to continue with an increase of five to seven percent. These gains in aggregates, coupled with pricing improvements across the downstream and cement businesses together with our cost discipline and strategic growth initiatives, are expected to drive increased earnings for the year,” said Mr. Nye. 

The Company also expects positive trends in its business and markets, notably:  

·  

Nonresidential construction is expected to increase in both the heavy industrial and commercial sectors. The Dodge Momentum Index is near its highest level since 2009 and signals continued growth. 

·  

Energy-related economic activity, including follow-on public and private construction activities in its primary markets, will be mixed with overall strength in downstream activity more than offsetting the decline in shale-related volumes.  

·  

Residential construction is expected to continue to grow, driven by positive employment gains, historically low levels of construction activity over the previous several years, low mortgage rates, significant lot absorption, and higher multi-family rental rates.  

·  

For the public sector, modest growth is expected in 2016 as new monies begin to flow into the system, particularly in the second half of the year. Additionally, state initiatives to finance infrastructure projects, including support from the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA), are expected to grow and continue to play an expanded role in public-sector activity. 

Based on these trends and expectations, the Company anticipates the following for full-year 2016:  

·  

Aggregates end-use markets compared to 2015 levels are as follows:  

·Infrastructure market to increase mid-single digits.  

·Nonresidential market to increase in the high-single digits.  

·Residential market to experience a double-digit increase. 

·ChemRock/Rail market to remain relatively flat to modestly down.

RISKS TO OUTLOOK 

The 2016 outlook includes management’s assessment of the likelihood of certain risks and uncertainties that will affect performance, including but not limited to: both price and volume, and a recurrence of widespread decline in aggregates volume negatively affecting aggregates price; the termination, capping and/or reduction of the federal and/or state gasoline tax(es) or other revenue related to infrastructure construction; a significant change in the funding patterns for traditional federal, state and/or local infrastructure projects; a reduction in defense spending, and the subsequent impact on construction activity on or near military bases; a decline in nonresidential construction; a further decline in energy-related drilling activity resulting from a sustained period of low global oil prices or changes in oil production patterns in response to this decline and certain regulatory or other economic factors; a slowdown in the residential construction recovery, or some combination thereof; a reduction in economic activity in the Company’s Midwest states resulting from reduced funding levels provided by the Agricultural Act of 2014 and a reduction in capital investment by the railroads; an increase in the cost of compliance with governmental laws and regulations; unexpected equipment failures, unscheduled maintenance, industrial accident or other prolonged and/or significant disruption to its cement and/or magnesia specialties production facilities; and the possibility that certain remaining synergies and operating efficiencies in connection with the TXI acquisition will not be fully realized within the expected time-frames or at all. Further, increased highway construction funding pressures resulting from either federal or state issues can affect profitability. If these negatively affect transportation budgets more than in the past, construction spending could be reduced. Cement is subject to cyclical supply and demand and price fluctuations. The Magnesia Specialties business essentially runs at capacity; therefore, any unplanned changes in costs or realignment of customers introduce volatility to the earnings of this segment. 

The Company’s principal business serves customers in aggregates-related construction markets. This concentration could increase the risk of potential losses on customer receivables; however, payment bonds normally posted on public projects, together with lien rights on private projects, help to mitigate the risk of uncollectible receivables. The level of aggregates demand in the Company’s end-use markets, production levels and the management of production costs will affect the operating leverage of the Aggregates business and, therefore, profitability. Production costs in the Aggregates business are also sensitive to energy and raw material prices, both directly and indirectly. Diesel fuel and other consumables change production costs directly through consumption or indirectly by increased energy-related input costs, such as steel, explosives, tires and conveyor belts. Fluctuating diesel fuel pricing also affects transportation costs, primarily through fuel surcharges in the Company’s long-haul distribution network. The Cement business is also energy intensive and fluctuations in the price of coal affects costs. The Magnesia Specialties business is sensitive to changes in domestic steel capacity utilization and the absolute price and fluctuations in the cost of natural gas. 

Transportation in the Company’s long-haul network, particularly the supply of rail cars and locomotive power and condition of rail infrastructure to move trains, affects the Company’s ability to efficiently transport aggregate into certain markets, most notably Texas, Florida and the Gulf Coast. In addition, availability of rail cars and locomotives affects the Company’s ability to move dolomitic lime, a key raw material for magnesia chemicals, to both the Company’s plant in Manistee, Michigan, and customers. The availability of trucks, drivers and railcars to transport the Company’s product, particularly in markets experiencing high growth and increased demand, is also a risk and pressures the associated costs.  

All of the Company’s businesses are also subject to weather-related risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profitability. The first and fourth quarters are most adversely affected by winter weather. Hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast generally is most active during the third and fourth quarters.

February 9, 2016 

Risks to the outlook also include shipment declines as a result of economic events beyond the Company’s control. In addition to the impact on nonresidential and residential construction, the Company is exposed to risk in its estimated outlook from credit markets and the availability of and interest cost related to its debt. 

The Company’s future performance is also exposed to risks from tax reform at the federal and state levels.
