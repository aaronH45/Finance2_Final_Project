AND FULL-YEAR 2016 EARNINGS GUIDANCE -

Columbus, Ohio, Feb. 24, 2016 - L Brands, Inc. (NYSE: LB) today reported record 2015 fourth quarter and full-year results.

Leslie H. Wexner, chairman and chief executive officer, commented, “We delivered record results in a year when many retailers struggled. These results are a reflection of the strength of our brands and were driven by tremendous focus and execution across the enterprise. I am very optimistic heading into 2016 and confident in our growth opportunities.”

Fourth Quarter Results

Earnings per share for the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, 2016, increased 14% to $2.15 from $1.89 for the quarter ended Jan. 31, 2015. Fourth quarter operating income increased 13% to $1.078 billion from $957.0 million last year. Net income increased 13% to $636.0 million compared to $564.8 million last year. 

Net sales for the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, 2016, were $4.395 billion, an increase of 8% compared to $4.069 billion for the quarter ended Jan. 31, 2015. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, 2016, increased 6%. 

Full-Year Results

Adjusted earnings per share for the year ended Jan. 30, 2016, which exclude a $78.1 million ($0.23 per share) first quarter pre-tax gain on the sale of the company’s remaining interest in the third-party apparel sourcing business, increased 14% to $3.99 compared to $3.50 for the year ended Jan. 31, 2015. Full-year operating income increased 12% to $2.192 billion compared to $1.953 billion last year, and adjusted net income was $1.184 billion compared to $1.042 billion last year. 

Including the gain from the sale of the sourcing business mentioned above, reported full-year earnings per share were $4.22 compared to $3.50 last year, and net income was $1.253 billion compared to $1.042 billion last year.

Net sales for the year ended Jan. 30, 2016, were $12.154 billion, an increase of 6% compared to $11.454 billion for the year ended Jan. 31, 2015. Comparable store sales for the year ended Jan. 30, 2016, increased 5%.

2016 Outlook

The company currently expects 2016 full-year earnings per share to be between $3.90 and $4.10, including earnings per share between $0.50 and $0.55 in the first quarter. The 2016 earnings per share forecast includes negative impacts related to continued pressure from foreign currency exchange rates and incremental interest expense related to the $1 billion October 2015 note issuance.

The company expects to report a mid-single digit increase in February comparable store sales, above expectations for a low-single digit increase, reflecting a mid-single digit increase at both Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works.

Beginning with the February 2016 sales report, the company will include direct sales in comparable store sales results, consistent with industry practice.
