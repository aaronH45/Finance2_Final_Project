AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION REPORTS

FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2015 FINANCIAL RESULTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Boston, Massachusetts – February 26, 2016: American Tower Corporation (NYSE: AMT) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2015. 

Jim Taiclet, American Tower’s Chief Executive Officer stated, “In 2015, we once again delivered double digit growth in revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per Share while increasing our common stock dividend by nearly 30%. At the same time, we strengthened our positioning across our major markets, including in our home U.S. market through the Verizon transaction, in Brazil through our TIM transaction, in Nigeria where we launched operations in connection with our acquisition of sites from Airtel and most recently in India through our agreement to acquire a majority interest in Viom.

In 2016, we expect to extend our proven track record of generating double digit growth across our key metrics as we drive additional organic revenue on our existing assets and selectively seek complementary new investments, all while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet.”

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS OVERVIEW

American Tower generated the following operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 (unless otherwise indicated, all comparative information is presented against the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014, as applicable). During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company changed its reportable segments to divide its international segment into three regional segments and changed the title of its rental and management segment to “Property” and its network development services segment to “Services”. 

The Company now operates in five reportable segments: U.S. property, Asia property, EMEA property, Latin America property and Services. The Company believes this reporting structure provides more visibility into its operating segments as they continue to grow and corresponds with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing the growth and profitability of the business and assessing its operating performance. Detailed segment-level operating results are provided below. 

For the full year 2015, the Company exceeded the midpoint of its previously issued outlook for total property revenue by approximately $30 million and Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $22 million, driven by strong operating results across its global footprint. Compared to the prior year period, net income for the full year was impacted by a one-time cash tax charge related to Global Tower Partners (“GTP”), expenses associated with the early retirement of debt and the non-cash impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany balances.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Property revenue Core Growth reflects revenue growth excluding the impacts of straight-line and pass-through revenue, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and significant one-time items.

(2)Q4 2015 Organic Core Growth excludes revenue growth associated with properties that the Company has added to the portfolio since the beginning of Q4 2014. FY 2015 Organic Core Growth excludes revenue growth attributable to sites added to the portfolio on or after January 1, 2014.

For the full year 2015, the Company exceeded the midpoint of its previously issued outlook for Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) by approximately $25 million, driven by strong growth in Adjusted EBITDA as well as lower than forecasted cash interest expense and cash tax payments.

FULL YEAR 2016 OUTLOOK

The following estimates are based on a number of assumptions that management believes to be reasonable and reflect the Company’s expectations as of February 26, 2016. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates as a result of various factors, and the Company refers you to the cautionary language regarding “forward-looking” statements included in this press release when considering this information.

In addition, the costs associated with financing the transaction have been reflected in the Company’s outlook.

Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures

In addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) provided throughout this press release, the Company has presented the following non-GAAP and defined financial measures: Gross Margin, Operating Profit, Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, NAREIT Funds From Operations, AFFO, AFFO per Share, Core Growth, Organic Core Growth, New Property Core Growth, Net Leverage Ratio, Tenant Run-Rate Revenue and Tenant Non-Run Rate Revenue. The Company uses Funds From Operations as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), referred to herein as NAREIT Funds From Operations.

The Company defines Gross Margin as revenues less operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations, depreciation, amortization and accretion, selling, general, administrative and development expense and other operating expenses. The Company defines Operating Profit as Gross Margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. For reporting purposes, the Latin America property segment Operating Profit and Gross Margin also include interest income, TV Azteca, net. These measures of Gross Margin and Operating Profit are also before interest income, interest expense, gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, other income (expense), net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest, income (loss) on equity method investments and income tax benefit (provision). The Company defines Operating Profit Margin as the percentage that results from dividing Operating Profit by revenue. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before income (loss) from equity method investments, income tax benefit (provision), other income (expense), gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, interest expense, interest income, other operating income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion and stock-based compensation expense. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA Margin as the percentage that results from dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. NAREIT Funds From Operations is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interest. The Company defines AFFO as NAREIT Funds From Operations before (i) straight-line revenue and expense, (ii) stock-based compensation expense, (iii) the non-cash portion of its tax provision, (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges, (vi) other income (expense), (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, (viii) other operating income (expense), and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interest, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. The Company defines AFFO per Share as AFFO divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. The Company defines Core Growth in total property revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO as the increase or decrease, expressed as a percentage, resulting from a comparison of financial results for a current period with corresponding financial results for the corresponding period in a prior year, in each case, excluding the impact of pass-through revenue (expense), where applicable, straight-line revenue and expense

recognition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and significant one-time items. The Company defines Organic Core Growth in property revenue as the increase or decrease, expressed as a percentage, resulting from a comparison of financial results for a current period with corresponding financial results for the corresponding period in a prior year, in each case, excluding the impact of pass-through revenue (expense), straight-line revenue and expense recognition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, significant one-time items and revenue associated with new properties that the Company has added to the portfolio since the beginning of the prior year period. The Company defines New Property Core Growth in property revenue as the increase or decrease, expressed as a percentage, on the properties the Company has added to its portfolio since the beginning of the prior year period, in each case excluding the impact of pass-through revenue (expense), straight-line revenue and expense recognition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and significant one-time items. The Company defines Net Leverage Ratio as net debt (total debt, less cash and cash equivalents) divided by last quarter annualized Adjusted EBITDA. The Company defines Tenant Run-Rate Revenue as primarily cash-based, recurring revenues, typically tied to long-term tenant lease agreements that in the absence of churn at the end of the contract term should continue in the future, excluding pass-through revenue. The Company defines Tenant Non-Run Rate Revenue as primarily non-recurring revenue, including back-billing, decommissioning agreements and straight-line revenue, as well as out-of-period items, excluding pass-through revenue. These measures are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, they are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of the Company's core businesses. The Company believes that these measures can assist in comparing company performances on a consistent basis irrespective of depreciation and amortization or capital structure. Depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors, including historical cost bases, are involved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's measures of Gross Margin, Operating Profit, Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, NAREIT Funds From Operations, AFFO, AFFO per Share, Core Growth, Organic Core Growth, New Property Core Growth, Net Leverage Ratio, Tenant Run-Rate Revenue and Tenant Non-Run Rate Revenue may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

As this charge is non-recurring, the Company does not believe it is an indication of operating performance and believes it is more meaningful to present AFFO excluding its impact.
