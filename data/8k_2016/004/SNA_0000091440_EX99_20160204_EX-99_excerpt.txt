Excluding $14.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales declined $1.7 million, or 0.6%, as lower sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector were partially offset by sales gains from both the segment’s power tools operations and European-based hand tools business.

 Outlook  

 Snap-on expects to make continued progress in 2016 along its defined runways for coherent growth, leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base, not only in automotive repair, but in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. In pursuit of these initiatives, Snap-on expects that capital expenditures in 2016 will be in a range of $80 million to $90 million.
