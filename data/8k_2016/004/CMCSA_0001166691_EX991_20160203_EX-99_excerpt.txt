Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Comcast Corporation, said, “I am exceptionally proud of our results this year, which were driven by strong performances in each of our core businesses. At Comcast Cable, our focus on delivering the most innovative products and improving the customer experience led to fantastic operating metrics, including our best video customer results in nine years, and our best high-speed Internet customer results in eight years. NBCUniversal had a remarkable year, with record-breaking results at both Theme Parks and Film, and continued success at NBC, which was number one in primetime for the second consecutive season. As we enter 2016, the momentum we see across our portfolio is truly exciting. We are executing at the highest level, investing prudently, and energized and focused on driving growth and shareholder value. Underscoring our confidence in our company, we are increasing our dividend by 10% to $1.10 per share and we also plan to repurchase $5.0 billion of our stock this year.”

Revenue for Cable Communications increased 5.9% to $12.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $11.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by increases of 9.8% in high-speed Internet, 4.4% in video and 18.9% in business services, partially offset by a 9.3% decline in advertising due to lower political advertising revenue.

For the fourth quarter of 2015, Cable Networks segment revenue increased 3.4% to $2.4 billion and operating cash flow decreased 1.9% to $894 million. These results reflect a 6.8% increase in distribution revenue, partially reflecting NASCAR on our sports network, NBCSN, which was more than offset by a modest 0.3% decline in advertising revenue and an increase in sports programming costs, reflecting the impact of NASCAR and higher programming costs for the English Premier League.

Excluding $257 million of revenue generated by the 2014 Sochi Olympics, revenue increased 3.5% (see Table 5), reflecting a 6.5% increase in distribution revenue and a 0.6% increase in advertising, partially offset by lower content licensing and other revenue.

For the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue from the Filmed Entertainment segment increased 25.8% to $1.6 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting a 74.9% increase in home entertainment revenue driven by the strong performances of Minions and Jurassic World, as well as a 22.7% increase in content licensing revenue, partially offset by a 37.5% decline in theatrical revenue. Operating cash flow increased 84.6% to $143 million compared to $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by a 22.1% increase in operating costs, primarily driven by an increase in the amortization of film costs. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue from the Filmed Entertainment segment increased 45.5% to $7.3 billion compared to $5.0 billion in 2014, driven by higher theatrical revenue from the record performances of Minions, Jurassic World, and Furious 7. Operating cash flow increased 73.5% to $1.2 billion compared to $711 million in 2014, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by a 40.9% increase in operating expenses, primarily driven by an increase in the amortization of film costs and higher advertising, marketing and promotion expense due to a larger film slate. 

Theme Parks 

For the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue from the Theme Parks segment increased 38.6% to $1.0 billion compared to $735 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter operating cash flow increased 36.6% to $452 million compared to $330 million in the same period last year. Previously reported amounts have been adjusted to include costs associated with a change in the presentation of amounts payable for a contractual obligation4 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding $169 million of revenue and $80 million of operating cash flow attributable to Universal Studios Japan from its acquisition date, revenue increased 15.5% and operating cash flow increased 12.3% (see Table 5). These results reflect higher guest attendance and per capita spending, driven by the continued success of Orlando’s The Wizarding World of Harry Potter™ — Diagon Alley™, Hollywood’s Fast and Furious: Supercharged, as well as Halloween Horror Nights at the Orlando and Hollywood parks, partially offset by an increase in operating costs to support new attractions. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue from the Theme Parks segment increased 27.3% to $3.3 billion compared to $2.6 billion in 2014. Operating cash flow increased 33.5% to $1.5 billion compared to $1.1 billion in 2014.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, NBCUniversal Headquarters, Other and Eliminations operating cash flow loss was $563 million compared to a loss of $542 million in 2014.

Notes: 

1 We define Operating Cash Flow as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of assets, if any. 

2 Earnings per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. 

3 We define Free Cash Flow as Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets, principal payments on capital leases and cash distributions to noncontrolling interests; and adjusted for any payments and receipts related to certain nonoperating items, net of estimated tax benefits. The definition of Free Cash Flow excludes any impact from Economic Stimulus packages. These amounts have been excluded from Free Cash Flow to provide an appropriate comparison. 

4 NBCUniversal changed its method of accounting for a contractual obligation that involves an interest in the revenue of certain theme parks. As a result of the change, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, amounts payable based on current period revenue are presented in operating costs and expenses. Amounts paid through the third quarter of 2015 were included in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income. For segment reporting purposes, we have adjusted periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2015 to reflect this expense on a consistent basis for all periods in the Theme Parks segment, which resulted in an offsetting adjustment in NBCUniversal Headquarters, Other and Eliminations. 

All percentages are calculated on whole numbers. Minor differences may exist due to rounding.
