ATLANTA, February 10, 2016 -- Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) today announced financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2015. 

“2015 was an outstanding year for Equifax. Our strong performance continued throughout the fourth quarter, with broad-based contribution from each of the business units. We are well positioned for 2016 and beyond,” said Richard F. Smith, Equifax’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We enter 2016 with great momentum driven by our New Product Innovation, Enterprise Growth Initiatives, and a management team that is dedicated to delivering its best to our customers, shareholders, employees, and consumers. In addition, we shortly expect to close on a large strategic acquisition. Veda Group, the premier provider of information solutions in Australia and New Zealand, will bring a highly experienced management team with new and exciting growth opportunities in the Asia Pacific region for 2016 and beyond.”

Financial Results Summary

The company reported revenue of $666.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a 7 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2014 and a 10 percent increase in local currency. 

Fourth quarter diluted EPS attributable to Equifax was $0.93, an increase of 16 percent as compared to fourth quarter of 2014. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax was $1.14, up 12 percent as compared to fourth quarter of 2014. This financial measure for 2015 excludes the Veda acquisition related amounts. The financial measure for both 2015 and 2014 excludes the acquisition-related amortization expense, net of associated tax impacts, as described more fully in the attached Q&A.

For the full year 2015, revenue was $2.7 billion, a 9 percent increase from 2014. Diluted EPS attributable to Equifax was $3.55, a 19 percent increase from the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, full year adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax was $4.50, up 16 percent from the prior year period.

On a non-GAAP basis, full year adjusted operating margin was 27.4%, up 90 basis points from the prior year.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we implemented an organizational realignment which changed our internal structure to include our direct to consumer reseller business in our Personal Solutions segment. This change affected the USIS and International segments, specifically Canada and the U.K. These changes were driven by an enterprise wide strategy to maximize the penetration of our products and services in our targeted markets, and aligned with the recent organizational changes for the business unit leadership. The segment results below reflect this change for all periods presented. Refer to Question 1 in the attached Q&A for more information.

First Quarter and Full Year 2016 Outlook

For the full year, based on the current level of domestic and international business activity, and the Veda acquisition later this month, we anticipate revenue between $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion, and Adjusted EPS between $4.95 and $5.05. Given the recent strength of the US dollar, at current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency to negatively impact 2016 revenue growth between 2% to 3%, and Adjusted EPS by approximately $0.13. On a constant currency basis, revenue is expected to grow 15% to 19% in 2016. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 13% to 15%. 

For the first quarter, based on the current level of domestic and international business activity, not including the Veda acquisition, we anticipate revenue between $685.0 million and $695.0 million, and Adjusted EPS between $1.14 and $1.16. Given the recent strength of the US dollar, at current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency to negatively impact revenue growth by 3%, and Adjusted EPS by approximately $0.04. On a constant currency basis, organic revenue is expected to grow 8% to 10% and Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 10% to 12%. 

Quarterly Dividend Announcement

The Equifax Board of Directors has approved a 14% increase in the quarterly cash dividend, increasing it to $0.33 per share from the previous quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures

Veda acquisition related amounts for due diligence and fees incurred as a direct result of the proposed acquisition, as well as integration expense in the first year following the closure of the acquisition - During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded $0.5 million ($0.3 million, net of tax) for Veda acquisition related amounts. $3.7 million relates to due diligence expenses and fees incurred as a direct result of the proposed acquisition, recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses on our consolidated statement of income. $4.2 million relates to a mark-to-market gain on foreign currency options and amortization of acquisition specific debt issuance costs, recorded in other income, net, on our consolidated statement of income and does not impact our operating margin. The foreign currency options will expire or will be exercised in Q1 2016. During 2015, there was no adjustment for integration expense, however, management plans to exclude integration expense for the first year following the closure of the acquisition. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Income from the settlement of escrow amounts related to a past acquisition - During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded income of $12.3 million ($11.1 million, net of tax) from the settlement of escrow amounts related to an acquisition completed in January 2014. Management believes excluding this income from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014, since an income of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Accrual for certain legal claims - During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a charge of $7.5 million ($4.7 million, net of tax) related to an accrual for certain legal claims. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014, since a charge of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Impairment of our cost method investment in Brazil - During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a charge of $14.8 million ($9.8 million, net of tax) related to the impairment of our cost method investment in Brazil. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014, since a charge of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

State income tax benefit - During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded an unanticipated state income tax benefit of $8.6 million, due to a change in tax law. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014, because a charge of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Charge related to the realignment of internal resources and other - During the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a charge of $23.4 million ($14.9 million, net of tax). This charge was predominantly related to the realignment of our internal resources to support the Company’s strategic objectives and increase the integration of our global operations. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014, since a charge of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Acquisition-related amortization expense, net of tax - We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the material cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management believes excluding the impact of amortization expense is useful because excluding acquisition-related amortization, and other items that are not comparable, allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Certain acquired intangibles result in material cash income tax savings which are not reflected in earnings. Management believes that including a benefit to reflect the cash income tax savings is useful as it 

17

allows investors to better value Equifax. Management makes these adjustments to earnings when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital.

Redeemable noncontrolling interest adjustment- During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, there was not an adjustment of redeemable noncontrolling interest as the redemption value is not in excess of fair value. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements – During the third quarter of 2014, we recorded a settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements of $7.9 million ($5.0 million, net of tax) in our USIS segment. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to operating income when measuring operating profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Adjusted operating income and operating margin, excluding acquisition specific transaction and due diligence expense, accrual for certain legal claims, realignment of internal resources and other costs, and settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreement - Management believes excluding the impact of acquisition specific transaction and due diligence expense, accrual for certain legal claims, realignment of internal resources and other costs, and settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreement from the calculation of operating income and operating margin, on a non-GAAP basis, allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis.
