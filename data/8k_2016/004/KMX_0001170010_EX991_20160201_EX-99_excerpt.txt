CARMAX ANNOUNCES EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION

Richmond, Va., February 1, 2016 – CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) today announced that, as the culmination of a multi-year management succession plan, Bill Nash has been promoted to president and Cliff Wood has been promoted to chief operating officer, effective February 1, 2016. Tom Folliard plans to retire as chief executive officer prior to the end of 2016, at which time it is anticipated that Mr. Nash will assume the role of CEO. Upon Mr. Folliard’s retirement, the Board of Directors expects that he will serve as the non-executive chairman of the board.

“Tom Folliard has built an exceptional management team at CarMax, positioning the company for continued growth,” said Bill Tiefel, chairman of the board. “The execution of our long-term succession plan, with Bill as president and Cliff as COO, ensures a seamless management transition and the continuity of the company’s culture.” Mr. Folliard, 51, has been with CarMax for 23 years and was promoted to president and CEO in May 2006. During his ten years as CEO, Mr. Folliard successfully led CarMax through the company’s establishment as a national brand and a time of significant growth, during which its store base and total revenues more than doubled, and its net income quadrupled.

Mr. Nash, 46, was promoted to executive vice president, human resources and administrative services in 2012, where he oversaw human resources, information technology, procurement, loss prevention, employee health & safety and construction & facilities. He joined CarMax in 1997 as auction manager and was ultimately promoted to vice president of auction services. In 2007, Mr. Nash was promoted to vice president and later, senior vice president of merchandising, a position he held until 2011, when he was named senior vice president, human resources and administrative services. Before joining CarMax, Mr. Nash, a CPA, held a variety of accounting roles at Circuit City. “Bill Nash and I have worked together for nearly 20 years. He is a highly talented leader with experience in all aspects of our business and is the right choice to guide CarMax through the next phase of our growth and development,” said Mr. Folliard.

Mr. Wood, 49, was promoted to executive vice president, stores in 2012, where he was responsible for all sales, service, merchandising, and business office functions. In 1993, he joined CarMax from Circuit City as a buyer in CarMax’s first location. Over time, he rose through the ranks in merchandising and ultimately led the group. Beginning in 2007, he served as vice president of sales. “We are fortunate to have another great leader in Cliff Wood,” said Mr. Folliard. “His breadth of experience and high level of operational expertise will continue to support CarMax’s competitive differentiation.”

“I would like to thank Tom for his vision and support over the years,” said Mr. Nash. “I am honored and excited to have this opportunity. We have an exceptional team of associates who have maintained the truly unique culture that has placed us on Fortune’s ‘100 Best Companies To Work For’ list for 11 consecutive years. Our associates continue to deliver a customer experience that is second to none.”
