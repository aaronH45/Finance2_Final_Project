Item 8.01 Other Events. 

On February 17, 2016, The Macerich Company (the “Company”) entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with one if its investment banks. Under the terms of the ASR agreement, the Company agreed to repurchase $400 million of its outstanding common stock, with an aggregate initial delivery of approximately 4.2 million shares, representing approximately 80% of the total value of the transaction based on current market prices. The final number of shares of the Company’s common stock to be repurchased will be based on the volume-weighted average share price of the Company’s common stock during the term of the ASR, minus a discount. The final settlement of the transactions under the ASR agreement is expected to occur within two months. 

The Company is funding the ASR with cash proceeds generated from the recent sale of joint venture interests in four malls and related refinancings. The ASR is being executed as part of an authorization by the Company’s Board of Directors to repurchase up to $1.2 billion of the Company’s outstanding common stock, announced on September 30, 2015.
