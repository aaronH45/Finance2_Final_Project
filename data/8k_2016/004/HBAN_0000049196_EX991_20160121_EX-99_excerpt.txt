HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED REPORTS 2015 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS INCLUDING 9% YEAR-OVER-YEAR REVENUE GROWTH AND 11% YEAR-OVER-YEAR EPS GROWTH

COLUMBUS, Ohio – Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN; www.huntington.com) reported net income for the 2015 fourth quarter of $178 million, or a 9% increase from the year-ago quarter. Earnings per common share for the 2015 fourth quarter were $0.21, up 11% from the year-ago quarter. Return on average assets was 1.00%, while return on average tangible common equity was 12.4%. 

2015 full-year net income was $693 million, an increase of 10% from the prior year. Earnings per common share for the year were $0.81, up 13% from the prior year. Return on average assets for the full year was 1.01%, while return on average tangible common equity was 12.4%. Total revenue increased 6% over the prior year.

“We are very pleased with our 2015 performance. Impressive full-year revenue growth, coupled with disciplined expense control, delivered strong net income and EPS growth for our shareholders,” said Steve Steinour, chairman, president and CEO. “Our consistent execution of disciplined lending and investment within a risk-balanced environment continues to pay off. We also took proactive steps to better position the company moving into 2016 by investing in key growth drivers, such as technology and our in-store strategy, while exiting some non-core businesses.”

“I am particularly encouraged with our fee income growth as our fourth quarter performance resulted in a strong finish for the year,” Steinour said. “Furthermore, the finalization of our in-store branch expansion is also visibly supporting our deposit and loan growth.”

The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the company’s common stock of $0.07 per common share. The dividend is payable April 1, 2016, to shareholders of record on March 18, 2016.

Table 2 lists certain items that Management believes are significant in understanding corporate performance and trends (see Basis of Presentation). There were two Significant Items in the 2015 fourth quarter: (a) $8 million of franchise repositioning expense related to branch closures and impairment of facilities' leases, and (b) $0.4 million of merger and acquisition-related net gains from the sale of Huntington Asset Advisors ("HAA"), Huntington Asset Services ("HASI"), and Unified Financial Securities ("Unified"), which were completed during the 2015 fourth

Fully-taxable equivalent (FTE) net interest income for the 2015 fourth quarter increased $25 million, or 5%, from the 2014 fourth quarter. This reflected the benefit from the $5.0 billion, or 8%, increase in average earning assets partially offset by a 9 basis point reduction in the FTE net interest margin (NIM) to 3.09%. Average earning asset growth included a $2.7 billion, or 6%, increase in average loans and leases and a $2.1 billion, or 17%, increase in average securities. The NIM contraction reflected a 4 basis point decrease related to the mix and yield of earning assets and 9 basis point increase in funding costs, partially offset by the 4 basis point increase in the benefit from noninterest-bearing funds.

Compared to the 2015 third quarter, FTE net interest income increased $2 million, or less than 1%. Average earning assets increased $1.6 billion, or 3%, sequentially, while the NIM decreased 7 basis points. The decrease in the NIM reflected a 5 basis point decrease related to the mix and yield of earning assets and a 2 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.

Average earning assets for the 2015 fourth quarter increased $5.0 billion, or 8%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compared to the 2015 third quarter, average earning assets increased $1.6 billion, or 3%. This increase reflected a $0.8 billion, or 6%, increase in average securities, a $0.4 billion, or 5%, increase in Automobile loans, and a $0.4 billion, or 2%, increase in C&I loans.

Average total deposits for the 2015 fourth quarter increased $4.6 billion, or 9%, from the year-ago quarter, including a $3.9 billion, or 8%, increase in average total core deposits. The growth in average total core deposits more than fully funded the year-over-year increase in average total loans and leases. Average total interest-bearing liabilities increased $3.3 billion, or 8%, from the year-ago quarter. Year-over-year changes in average total deposits and average total debt included:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Partially offset by:

•$0.6 billion, or 21%, decrease in average core certificates of deposit due to the strategic focus on changing the funding sources to low- and no-cost demand deposits and money market deposits.

Compared to the 2015 third quarter, average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased $0.2 billion, or 1%, and average total interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.2 billion, or 3%. The increase in average total interest-bearing liabilities reflected the issuance of $0.9 billion of long-term debt during the 2015 fourth quarter, a

$0.3 billion, or 2%, increase in average money market deposits, and a $0.3 billion, or 5%, increase in average interest bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a $0.3 billion decrease in average short-term borrowings.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income for the 2015 fourth quarter increased $39 million, or 17%, from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflected:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•$5 million, or 87%, increase in gain on sale of loans, reflecting strong SBA loan sales in the 2015 fourth quarter.

Partially offset by:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compared to the 2015 third quarter, total noninterest income increased $19 million, or 8%. Mortgage banking income increased $12 million, or 66%, primarily driven by a $9 million increase in net MSR hedging-related activities and a $4 million increase in origination and secondary marketing income. Gain on sale of loans increased $4 million, or 72%, as a result of higher SBA loan sales. Other noninterest income increased $3 million, or 8%, primarily reflecting the $3 million gain on the sale of HAA, HASI, and Unified.

Partially offset by:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Reported noninterest expense decreased $28 million, or 5%, from the 2015 third quarter. Other expense decreased $40 million, or 49%, from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting the $38 million addition to litigation reserves in the 2015 third quarter. Outside data processing and other services increased $5 million, or 9%, due to costs related to the build-out of the in-store strategy and ongoing technology investments. Net occupancy expense increased $4 million, or 13%, primarily due to actions related to franchise repositioning.

Overall asset quality remains strong, with modest volatility based on the absolute low level of problem credits. Nonaccrual loans and leases (NALs) increased $71 million, or 24%, from the year-ago quarter to $372 million, or 0.74% of total loans and leases. The increase was primarily centered in the Commercial portfolio and was primarily comprised of several large energy-related relationships. Nonperforming assets (NPAs) increased $61 million, or 18%, from the year-ago quarter to $399 million, or 0.79% of total loans and leases and net OREO. NALs increased $15 million, or 4%, from the prior quarter, while NPAs increased $18 million, or 5%, from the prior quarter.

The provision for credit losses increased to $36 million in the 2015 fourth quarter compared to $2 million in the 2014 fourth quarter. Net charge-offs (NCOs) decreased $1 million, or 5%, to $22 million. NCOs represented an annualized 0.18% of average loans and leases in the current quarter, up from 0.13% in the prior quarter but down from 0.20% in the year-ago quarter. The quarter's results were positively impacted by recovery activity in the C&I and CRE portfolios as a result of continued successful workout strategies. The increase in Consumer charge-offs from the prior quarter was centered in the Indirect Auto portfolio primarily as a result of seasonality. We continue to be pleased with the net charge-off performance across the entire portfolio, as we remain below our targeted range. Overall consumer credit metrics, led by the Home Equity portfolio continue to show an improving trend, while the Commercial portfolios continue to experience some quarter-to-quarter volatility based on the absolute low level of problem loans.

The period-end allowance for credit losses (ACL) as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to 1.33% from 1.40% a year ago, while the ACL as a percentage of period-end total NALs decreased to 180% from 222%. Management believes the level of the ACL is appropriate given the improvement in the credit quality metrics and the current composition of the overall loan and lease portfolio.

(1)December 31, 2015 figures are estimated and are presented on a Basel III basis, including the standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets.

See Pages 16 and 17 of Quarterly Financial Supplement for additional detail.

The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.81% at December 31, 2015, down 36 basis points from a year ago. On a Basel III basis, the regulatory Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio was 9.79% at December 31, 2015, and the regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.53%. On a Basel I basis, the Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio was 10.23% at December 31, 2014, and the regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.50%. All capital ratios were impacted by the repurchase of 23.0 million common shares over the last four quarters.

During the 2015 fourth quarter, the company repurchased 2.5 million common shares at an average price of $11.59 per share under the $366 million repurchase authorization included in the 2015 CCAR capital plan.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes in the 2015 fourth quarter was $56 million and $57 million in the 2014 fourth quarter. The effective tax rates for the 2015 fourth quarter and 2014 fourth quarter were 23.8% and 25.9%, respectively. At December 31, 2015, we had a net federal deferred tax asset of $7 million and a net state deferred tax asset of $43 million.

Expectations – 2016

“We are well positioned starting the new year,” Steinour said. “Although we continue to conservatively budget for unchanged interest rates through 2016, the Federal Reserve’s December rate increase is an encouraging sign for the near-term operating environment. We will continue to execute our core strategies to deepen and grow customer relationships while carefully managing expenses to stay on course for 2016 performance.”

Excluding Significant Items and net MSR activity, we expect full-year revenue growth will be consistent with our long-term financial goal of 4-6%. While continuing to proactively invest in the franchise, we will manage the expense base to reflect the revenue environment.

Overall, asset quality metrics are expected to remain near current levels, although moderate quarterly volatility also is expected, given the quickly evolving macroeconomic conditions, commodities and currency market volatility, and current low level of problem assets and credit costs. We anticipate NCOs will remain below our long-term 

10

normalized range of 35 to 55 basis points.

The effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be in the range of 25% to 28%.

Forward-looking Statement

This document contains certain forward-looking statements, including certain plans, expectations, goals, projections, and statements, which are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as expect, anticipate, believe, intend, estimate, plan, target, goal, or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as will, may, might, should, would, could, or similar variations.

While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the forward-looking statements: (1) worsening of credit quality performance due to a number of factors such as the underlying value of collateral that could prove less valuable than otherwise assumed and assumed cash flows may be worse than expected; (2) changes in general economic, political, or industry conditions; uncertainty in U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; volatility and disruptions in global capital and credit markets; (3) movements in interest rates; (4) competitive pressures on product pricing and services; (5) success, impact, and timing of our business strategies, including market acceptance of any new products or services implementing our “Fair Play” banking philosophy; (6) changes in accounting policies and principles and the accuracy of our assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements; (7) extended disruption of vital infrastructure; (8) the final outcome of significant litigation or adverse legal developments in the proceedings; (9) the nature, extent, timing, and results of governmental actions, examinations, reviews, reforms, regulations, and interpretations, including those related to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, as well as those involving the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, and CFPB; and 

(10) the outcome of judicial and regulatory decisions regarding practices in the residential mortgage industry, including among other things the processes followed for foreclosing residential mortgages. Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described above can be found in Huntington’s 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and documents subsequently filed by Huntington with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available at the time of the release. Huntington assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.

Basis of Presentation

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This document contains GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Huntington’s results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this fourth quarter earnings release, conference call slides, or the Form 8-K related to this document, all of which can be found on Huntington’s website at www.huntington-ir.com.

Significant Items

From time to time, revenue, expenses, or taxes are impacted by items judged by Management to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by Management at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature. We refer to such items as “Significant Items”. Most often, these Significant Items result from factors originating outside the Company – e.g., regulatory actions/assessments, windfall gains, changes in accounting principles, one-time tax assessments/refunds, litigation actions, etc. In other cases they may result from Management decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of business – e.g., merger/restructuring charges, recapitalization actions, goodwill impairment, etc.

Even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not define a Significant Item. For example, changes in the provision for credit losses, gains/losses from investment activities, asset valuation write-downs, etc., reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as a Significant Item.

Management believes the disclosure of “Significant Items”, when appropriate, aids analysts/investors in better understanding corporate performance and trends so that they can ascertain which of such items, if any, they may wish to include/exclude from their analysis of the Company’s performance - i.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from their expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust their estimates of future performance accordingly. To this end, Management has adopted a practice of listing “Significant Items” in its external disclosure documents (e.g., earnings press releases, quarterly performance discussions, investor presentations, Forms 10-Q and 10-K).

“Significant Items” for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance. A number of items could materially impact these periods, including those described in Huntington’s 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other factors described from time to time in Huntington’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Annualized Data

Certain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an “annualized” basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts. For example, loan and deposit growth rates, as well as net charge-off percentages, are most often expressed in terms of an annual rate like 8%. As such, a 2% growth rate for a quarter would represent an annualized 8% growth rate.

Fully-Taxable Equivalent Interest Income and Net Interest Margin

Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at statutory rates. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt municipal securities and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to results of competitors.

Earnings per Share Equivalent Data

11

Significant income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total corporate earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. Investors may also find this information helpful in their evaluation of the Company’s financial performance against published earnings per share mean estimate amounts, which typically exclude the impact of Significant Items. Earnings per share equivalents are usually calculated by applying a 35% effective tax rate to a pre-tax amount to derive an after-tax amount, which is divided by the average shares outstanding during the respective reporting period. Occasionally, when the item involves special tax treatment, the after-tax amount is disclosed separately, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.

Rounding

Please note that columns of data in this document may not add due to rounding.
