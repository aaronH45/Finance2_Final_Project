During the fourth quarter of 2015, Charter's residential customer relationships grew by 82,000, versus 67,000 in the prior-year period. Residential PSUs increased by 191,000 versus a gain of 151,000 in the prior-year period, driven by Charter Spectrum, an industry-leading suite of video, Internet, and voice services launched in 2014. Charter Spectrum includes over 200 HD channels, in addition to minimum offered Internet speeds of 60 Mbps, and a fully-featured voice service, delivered at a highly competitive price. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, 90% of Charter's residential customers received Charter Spectrum products.

Residential video customers increased by 29,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015, versus a loss of 3,000 in the year-ago period. For the past four years, Charter has significantly increased the competitiveness of its video product, by including more HD channels and video on demand offerings, attractive packaging of advanced services, improved selling methods, and enhanced service quality. Today, virtually all of Charter's passings are fully digitized, with access to more HD channels than satellite TV offers, and as of December 31, 2015, over 96% of Charter's residential video customers subscribed to the Company's expanded basic video service.

Charter has introduced its new cloud-based user interface, Spectrum Guide, to its video customers in certain markets, including Fort Worth, Texas and Reno, Nevada. Spectrum Guide dramatically improves video content search and discovery, and fully enables Charter's on-demand offering. In addition, Spectrum Guide can function on nearly all of Charter's deployed set-tops. Charter is also poised to launch its new set-top box, World Box, which features downloadable security along with other advanced functionality, driving an enhanced customer experience and reducing incremental set-top box costs.

Charter added 115,000 residential Internet customers in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 104,000 a year ago. As of December 31, 2015, 88% of Charter's residential Internet customers subscribed to tiers that provided speeds of 60 Mbps or more. The Company continues to see strong demand for its Internet service as consumers value the speed and reliability of Charter's Internet offering.

During the fourth quarter, the Company added 47,000 residential voice customers, versus a gain of 50,000 during the fourth quarter of 2014.

Fourth quarter residential revenue per customer relationship totaled $111.19, and grew by 2.3% as compared to the prior-year period, driven by higher product sell-in, promotional rate step-ups and rate adjustments, partially offset by continued single play Internet sell-in.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, small and medium business (SMB) customer relationships grew by 15,000 versus 12,000 during the fourth quarter of 2014. SMB PSUs increased 28,000, compared to 19,000 during the fourth quarter of 2014. Charter's accelerating SMB customer and PSU growth is being driven by the launch of the Spectrum Business product suite to the small and medium business segments during the first quarter of 2015. This competitive new offering is intended to provide better products and greater value to SMB customers.

Fourth Quarter Financial Results

UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND OPERATING DATA

(dollars in millions, except per share data) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenue

Fourth quarter 2015 revenues rose to $2.5 billion, 6.4% higher than the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by growth in Internet, video and commercial revenues.

Video revenues totaled $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 2.9% compared to the prior-year period. Video revenue growth was driven by higher advanced services penetration, annual and promotional rate adjustments and an increase in expanded basic and digital customers, partially offset by a decrease in residential limited basic video customers.

Internet revenues grew 16.6% compared to the year-ago quarter to $781 million, driven by an increase of 442,000 Internet customers during the last year and by promotional rolloff, price adjustments and revenue allocation from higher bundling. 

Voice revenues totaled $135 million, a decline of 2.7% versus the fourth quarter of 2014, due to value-based pricing and revenue allocation from higher bundling, partially offset by the addition of 159,000 voice customers in the last twelve months. 

Commercial revenues rose to $294 million, an increase of 12.3% over the prior-year period, and was driven by small and medium business revenue growth of 11.5% and enterprise revenue growth of 14.1%. Following the launch of new pricing and packaging for commercial customers, PSU growth has accelerated albeit at lower promotional pricing.

4

Fourth quarter advertising sales revenues of $87 million decreased 18.9% compared to the year-ago quarter primarily driven by a decrease in political advertising revenue of $16 million.

Operating Costs and Expenses

Fourth quarter total operating costs and expenses increased by $89 million, or 5.9%, compared to the year-ago period, reflecting increases in programming costs, other expenses and transition costs related to Charter's pending transactions with Time Warner Cable Inc. ("Time Warner Cable") and Bright House Networks, LLC ("Bright House"). Transition costs accounted for $22 million of total fourth quarter operating costs. Excluding transition costs, fourth quarter total operating expenses increased by $78 million, or 5.3% year-over-year.

Fourth quarter programming expense increased by $49 million, or 7.9%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting contractual programming increases and a higher number of expanded basic package customers and the introduction of new networks to Charter's video offering.

Costs to service customers remained virtually unchanged year-over-year despite year-over-year residential and SMB customer relationship growth of 5.6%, given improved service metrics. Other expenses grew by $28 million, or 14.8%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting higher corporate and administrative labor costs, including the insourcing of IT and software development resources, property taxes and insurance costs and enterprise sales and labor costs.

Adjusted EBITDA

 Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $908 million grew by 7.5% year-over-year, reflecting revenue growth and operating costs and expenses growth of 6.4% and 5.9%, respectively. Excluding transition-related expenses, fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.4% year-over-year.

Net Loss

Net loss totaled $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The year-over-year increase in net loss was driven by $231 million of interest expense related to the financing of Charter's pending transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House, offset by higher income from operations and lower income tax expense. Basic and diluted loss per common share was $1.09 in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.44 during the same period last year. The increase in loss per common share was primarily the result of the factors described above, partially offset by a 1.7% increase in weighted average shares outstanding versus the prior-year period.

Capital Expenditures

Property, plant and equipment expenditures totaled $548 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $543 million during the fourth quarter of 2014. The year-over-year increase in capital expenditures resulted from higher product development investments and transition capital expenditures related to Charter's planned and pending acquisitions, partially offset by a decline in customer premise equipment ("CPE") spending. CPE spending declined versus the prior-year period as Charter completed its all-digital initiative in the fourth quarter of 2014. Transition-related capital expenditures accounted for $49 million of capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding transition-related expenditures, fourth quarter property, plant and equipment expenditures totaled $499 million. 

Cash Flow

During the fourth quarter of 2015, net cash flows from operating activities totaled $611 million, compared to $630 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The year-over-year decline in net cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to higher cash interest paid in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by the financing of Charter's pending transactions with Time Warner Cable 

5

and Bright House, partly offset by an increase in Adjusted EBITDA year-over-year, and a positive contribution from working capital.

Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $80 million, compared to $89 million during the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to the factors described above.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenue

For the year ended December 31, 2015, revenues rose to $9.8 billion, 7.1% higher than in 2014, driven by continued growth in Internet, video and commercial revenues. 

Operating Costs and Expenses

Operating costs and expenses totaled $6.3 billion in 2015, an increase of $430 million, or 7.3%, compared to the year-ago period, reflecting increases in programming costs, other expenses and transition costs. Transition costs accounted for $72 million of total 2015 operating costs. Excluding transition costs, total operating expenses increased by $372 million, or 6.3% year over year. 

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA totaled $3.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 6.8% compared to 2014, reflecting revenue growth and operating costs and expenses growth of 7.1% and 7.3%, respectively. Excluding transition-related expenses, Adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.5% year-over-year.

7

Net Loss

For the year ended December 31, 2015, net loss was $271 million, compared to $183 million in 2014. The increase was driven by $506 million of interest expense related to the financing of Charter's pending transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House and previous transactions with Comcast Corporation ("Comcast"), and an increase in loss on extinguishment of debt, offset by an income tax benefit related to a partnership restructuring in the third quarter of 2015 and higher income from operations. Net loss per common share was $2.43 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.70 in 2014. The increase was primarily the result of the factors described above, offset by 3.2% increase in weighted average shares outstanding.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015, totaled $1.840 billion compared to $2.221 billion in 2014. The decrease was the result of the completion of Charter's all-digital initiative in 2014, partially offset by higher transition capital expenditures and product development costs in 2015. Transition-related capital expenditures accounted for $115 million and $27 million of capital expenditures in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Excluding transition-related expenses, 2015 property, plant and equipment expenditures totaled $1.725 billion, consistent with management expectations.

Cash Flow

In 2015, net cash flows from operating activities totaled $2.4 billion, and remained unchanged year-over-year, with higher Adjusted EBITDA offset by higher cash interest payments associated with debt issued to finance Charter's pending transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House and previous transactions with Comcast.

Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $547 million, compared to $171 million during the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to lower capital expenditures and higher Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by higher cash interest payments.

Liquidity & Financing

As of December 31, 2015, total principal amount of debt was approximately $35.9 billion, and Charter held $21.8 billion in proceeds from debt in escrow for Charter's pending transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House, described below. As of December 31, 2015, Charter's credit facilities provided approximately $961 million of additional liquidity.

In May 2015, Charter entered into a merger agreement with Time Warner Cable and CCH I, LLC (“New Charter”), pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will engage in a series of transactions that will result in Charter and Time Warner Cable becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of New Charter (the “TWC Transaction”). After giving effect to the TWC Transaction, New Charter will be the new public company parent that will hold the operations of the combined companies.

In May 2015, in connection with the execution of the merger agreement with Time Warner Cable, Charter's contribution agreement with Advance/Newhouse Partnership was amended pursuant to which Charter would become the owner of the membership interests in Bright House and any other assets primarily related to Bright House.

In July 2015, Charter issued $15.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes comprised of $2.0 billion of 3.579% senior secured notes due 2020, $3.0 billion of 4.464% senior secured notes due 2022, $4.5 billion of 4.908% senior secured notes due 2025, $2.0 billion of 6.384% senior secured notes due 2035, $3.5 billion of 6.484% senior secured notes due 2045 and $500 million of 6.834% senior notes due 2055. The net proceeds were deposited into an escrow account and will be used to partially finance the TWC Transaction as well as for general corporate purposes.

8

In August 2015, Charter closed on a new term loan H facility and a new term loan I facility totaling an aggregate principal amount of $3.8 billion. The new term loan H facility was issued at a principal amount of $1.0 billion and matures in 2021. Pricing on the new term loan H facility was set at LIBOR plus 2.50% with a LIBOR floor of 0.75% and issued at a price of 99.75% of the aggregate principal amount. The new term loan I facility was issued at a principal amount of $2.8 billion and matures in 2023. Pricing on the new term loan I facility was set at LIBOR plus 2.75% with a LIBOR floor of 0.75% and issued at a price of 99.75% of the aggregate principal amount. The net proceeds were deposited into an escrow account and will be used to partially finance the TWC Transaction as well as for general corporate purposes.

In November 2015, Charter issued $2.5 billion of 5.750% senior secured notes due 2026. The net proceeds were deposited into an escrow account and will be used to partially finance the TWC Transaction as well as for general corporate purposes.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Metrics 

The Company uses certain measures that are not defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) to evaluate various aspects of its business. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net loss or cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. These terms, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to net loss and free cash flow is reconciled to net cash flows from operating activities in the addendum of this news release. 

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net, other expense, net and other operating expenses, such as merger and acquisition costs, special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of the Company's businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by the Company's capital structure or investment activities. However, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and the cash cost of financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures.

Free cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less purchases of property, plant and equipment and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.

Management and the Company's board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to assess Charter's performance and its ability to service its debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under the Company's credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the credit facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission). For the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, we use Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by our 

10

operating subsidiaries to other Charter entities. Our debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees which fees were in the amount of $91 million and $69 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $322 million and $253 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(a)We calculate the aging of customer accounts based on the monthly billing cycle for each account. On that basis, at December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, customers include approximately 38,100, 36,800 and 35,100 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 60 days, approximately 1,700, 1,200 and 1,500 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 90 days and approximately 900, 800 and 900 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 120 days. 

(b)Passings represent our estimate of the number of units, such as single family homes, apartment and condominium units and small and medium business and enterprise sites passed by our cable distribution network in the areas where we offer the service indicated. These estimates are based upon the information available at this time and are updated for all periods presented when new information becomes available. 

(c)Penetration represents residential and small and medium business customers as a percentage of estimated passings for the service indicated.

(d)Customer relationships include the number of customers that receive one or more levels of service, encompassing video, Internet and voice services, without regard to which service(s) such customers receive. Total customer relationships excludes enterprise customer relationships.

(e)Charter revised its methodology for counting customers who reside in residential multiple dwelling units ("MDUs") that are billed under bulk contracts. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we count and report customers based on the number of billed units within each bulk MDU, similar to recent reporting changes at our peers and reflecting the completion of all-digital which requires a direct billing relationship for all units which receive a set-top box. Previously, our methodology for reporting residential customers generally excluded units under bulk arrangements, unless those units had a direct billing relationship. Prior year information has been revised to reflect our revised methodology.

(f)Single play, double play and triple play customers represent customers that subscribe to one, two or three of Charter service offerings, respectively.

(g)Single play, double play and triple play penetration represents the number of residential single play, double play and triple play customers, respectively, as a percentage of residential customer relationships.

(h)Monthly residential revenue per residential customer is calculated as total residential video, Internet and voice quarterly revenue divided by three divided by average residential customer relationships during the respective quarter.

(i)Charter revised its methodology for counting small and medium business video customers. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, small and medium business customers are counted based on the number of customer locations. Previously, we had counted and reported video customers on an equivalent bulk unit (“EBU”) basis. EBUs were calculated by dividing the bulk price charged to accounts in an area by the published rate charged to non-bulk residential customers in that market for the comparable tier of service. Prior year information has been revised to reflect our revised methodology. 

(j)Monthly small and medium business revenue per customer is calculated as total small and medium business quarterly revenue divided by three divided by average small and medium business customer relationships during the respective quarter.

(k)Enterprise PSUs represents the aggregate number of Charter's fiber service offerings counting each separate service offering at each customer location as an individual PSU.
