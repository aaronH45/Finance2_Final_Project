Cambridge, Mass., January 27, 2016 -- Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) today reported full year and fourth quarter 2015 results, including full year revenues of $10.8 billion, an 11% increase versus 2014.

Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Inc. for the year was $3.9 billion, an increase of 20% versus the prior year. 

On a reported basis, GAAP diluted EPS for 2015 were $15.34, an increase of 24% versus 2014. GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Inc. for 2015 was $3.5 billion, an increase of 21% versus 2014.

“We saw solid performance in our industry leading multiple sclerosis portfolio and strong adoption of our hemophilia therapies,” said Chief Executive Officer George A. Scangos, Ph.D. “We continue to make investments in important and promising programs that we believe have the potential to help people suffering from devastating diseases, and we are also excited about the potential to launch three new products this year: BENEPALI®, ZINBRYTATM, and an infliximab biosimilar.” 

“The year ahead will be very exciting for our pipeline, as we look to advance several potential breakthrough programs,” Dr. Scangos continued. “We are executing two Phase 3 clinical trials for aducanumab in Alzheimer’s disease, and are awaiting new data from two other Alzheimer’s candidates. We are encouraged by open label Phase 2 data for nusinersen for spinal muscular atrophy, the leading genetic cause of infant mortality, and are advancing two Phase 3 studies in infants and children with our collaboration partner Ionis. We expect to see Phase 2 data for anti-LINGO in multiple sclerosis in the middle of the year, allowing us to better understand its potential to reverse or repair damage caused by the disease. We are also focused on expanding our leadership in neurology by continuing to attract top talent and using new technology, novel science and a better understanding of disease biology to pursue early stage programs in areas such as Parkinson’s disease and ALS.”

ELOCTA, the trade name for ELOCTATE in Sobi’s territory, is the first hemophilia A treatment in the EU to offer prolonged protection against bleeding episodes with prophylactic injections every three to five days. Sobi will lead commercialization in Europe.

•In December 2015, Biogen presented new data demonstrating that ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX may effectively manage target joint bleeding and maintain low annualized bleeding rates in people with severe hemophilia A and B. The data were presented by Biogen and Sobi at the 57th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition.

•In December 2015, Biogen initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study of IONIS-SOD1Rx (BIIB067) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), including patients with a mutation in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), which accounts for approximately 2% of ALS patients. IONIS-SOD1Rx is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce the production of SOD1 and is being developed in collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

We supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis by providing additional measures which may be considered “non-GAAP” financial measures under applicable SEC rules. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional insight into the ongoing economics of our business and reflects how we manage our business internally, set operational goals and forms the basis of our management incentive programs. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for reported, or GAAP, net income attributable to Biogen Inc. and diluted earnings per share. 

Our “Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Inc.” and “Non-GAAP earnings per share - Diluted” financial measures exclude the following items from "GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Inc." and "GAAP earnings per share - Diluted": 

1. Purchase accounting and merger-related adjustments.

We exclude certain purchase accounting related items associated with the acquisition of businesses, assets and amounts in relation to the consolidation of variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. These adjustments include charges for in-process research and development, the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets and fair value remeasurement of our contingent consideration obligations. 

2. Stock option expense recorded in accordance with the accounting standard for share-based payments. 

3. Other items.

We evaluate other items on an individual basis, and consider both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We also include an adjustment to reflect the related tax effect of all reconciling items within our reconciliation of our GAAP to Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Inc.
