 Important Information and GAAP/Non-GAAP Information This document contains forward-looking statements within the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,” “targets,” “initiatives,” “potentially,” “probably,” “projects,” “outlook” or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” and “could.” Forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management and on information currently available to management. Our statements speak as of the date hereof and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation: negative economic conditions that adversely affect the general economy, housing prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits which may affect, among other things, the level of nonperforming assets, charge-offs and provision expense; the rate of growth in the economy and employment levels, as well as general business and economic conditions; our ability to implement our strategic plan, including the cost savings and efficiency components and achieve our indicative performance targets; our ability to remedy regulatory deficiencies and meet supervisory requirements and expectations; liabilities and business restrictions resulting from litigation and regulatory investigations; our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms; the effect of the current low interest rate environment or changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale; changes in interest rates and market liquidity, as well as the magnitude of such changes, which may reduce interest margins, impact funding sources and affect the ability to originate and distribute financial products in the primary and secondary markets; the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin; financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation and regulation relating to bank products and services; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; management’s ability to identify and manage these and other risks; and any failure by us to successfully replicate or replace certain functions, systems and infrastructure provided by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc (RBS). In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or share repurchases will depend on our financial condition, earnings, cash needs, regulatory constraints, capital requirements (including requirements of our subsidiaries) and any other factors that our board of directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock, or as to the amount of any such dividends. More information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on March 3, 2015. Note: Percentage changes, per share amounts and ratios presented in this document are calculated using whole dollars. Non‐GAAP Financial Measures This document contains non-GAAP financial measures. The Appendix hereto presents reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures include “total revenue”, “core revenue”, “noninterest income”, “core noninterest income”, “ noninterest expense”, “core noninterest expense”, “net income”, “core net income”, “net income available to common stockholders”, “core net income available to common stockholders”, “net interest income”, “core net interest income”, “service charges and fees”, “core service charges”, “card fees”, “core card fees”, “trust and investment service fees”, “core trust and investment service fees”, “other income”, and “core other income”. In addition, we present computations for “return of average tangible common equity”, “core return of average tangible common equity”, “return on average total assets”, “core return on average total assets”, “efficiency ratio”, “core efficiency ratio”, “net interest margin” and “operating leverage” as part of our non-GAAP measures. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because these are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and to make day-to-day operating decisions. We believe this presentation also increases comparability of period-to-period results. We also consider pro forma capital ratios defined by banking regulators but not effective at each period end to be non-GAAP financial measures. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using these pro forma ratios, we believe they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess our capital adequacy on the same basis. Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for our results as reported under GAAP.
