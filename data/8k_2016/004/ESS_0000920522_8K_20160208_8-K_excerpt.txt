Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

The Board of Directors of Essex Property Trust, Inc. (the “Company”) currently consists of 12 directors. The Company has had plans to reduce that number of directors. In connection with such plans, during the week of February 8, 2016, the Company was informed by each of David W. Brady, Thomas P. Sullivan and Claude Zinngrabe, Jr., who are all currently members of the Board, that they would not stand for re-election to the Board when their terms expire at the Company’s 2016 annual meeting of stockholders. The Board will then consist of 9 directors. Their decisions, as to not standing for re-election, were not due to any disagreements with the Company regarding the Company’s operations, policies or practices. The Company is grateful for their many contributions during their years of service as directors.
