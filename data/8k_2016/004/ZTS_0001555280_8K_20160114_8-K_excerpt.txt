Item 8.01. Other Events.

On January 14, 2016, Zoetis signed a share purchase agreement (the “Agreement”) with Yung Shin Pharmaceutical Industrial Co., Ltd., a pharmaceutical company with an animal health business and headquarters in Taiwan, for the divestment by Zoetis of its 55 percent ownership share of a manufacturing site in Hsinchu, Taiwan. All manufacturing and commercial employees at the legal entity will transfer to Yung Shin. The Agreement also provides for the divestment by Zoetis of a portfolio of products associated with the site. These products include medicated feed additives, anti-infective medicines and nutritional premixes for livestock sold primarily in Taiwan and in international markets.

Under the Agreement, Zoetis will receive approximately USD $13 million in cash. The transaction is not material to Zoetis Inc.

This transaction is an element of the Zoetis operational efficiency program announced on May 5, 2015, which is focused on reducing complexity, optimizing resource allocation and positioning the company for long-term profitable growth. The Taiwan manufacturing site to be divested under the Agreement is among those Zoetis expects to sell or exit as part of the efficiency program. The products to be divested under the Agreement represent a portion of the product stock keeping units that Zoetis expects to eliminate to help improve profitability and enhance the reliability and efficiency of the Zoetis supply network. 

Zoetis expects to complete the transaction in the second quarter of 2016, pending the successful completion of customary regulatory review in Taiwan.
