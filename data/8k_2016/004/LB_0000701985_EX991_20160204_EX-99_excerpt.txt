L BRANDS REPORTS RECORD FOURTH QUARTER SALES

- RAISES FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS GUIDANCE -

- INCREASES REGULAR DIVIDEND BY 20% - 

- DECLARES $2.00 SPECIAL DIVIDEND -

- AUTHORIZES NEW $500 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM -

Columbus, Ohio (Feb. 4, 2016) - L Brands, Inc. (NYSE: LB) reported net sales for the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, 2016, of $4.395 billion, an increase of 8% compared to $4.069 billion for the quarter ended Jan. 31, 2015. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, 2016, increased 6%. 

Net sales for the year ended Jan. 30, 2016, were $12.154 billion, an increase of 6% compared to $11.454 billion for the year ended Jan. 31, 2015. Comparable store sales for the year ended Jan. 30, 2016, increased 5%.

Net sales for the four-week period ended Jan. 30, 2016, were $811.3 million, an increase of 4% compared to sales of $783.1 million for the four-week period ended Jan. 31, 2015. Comparable store sales for the four weeks ended Jan. 30, 2016, decreased 2%. January sales results were negatively impacted by a timing shift in the Victoria’s Secret semi-annual sale into December. Absent the estimated impact of this timing shift, total company comps would have increased 1% in January.

The company expects to report fourth quarter earnings per share of about $2.05, above its previous guidance of $1.85 to $1.95. The company will report fourth quarter results and provide 2016 earnings guidance on its earnings call, which will be held on Feb. 25 at 9 a.m. Eastern. Earnings in 2016 will be negatively impacted by $0.10 per share in incremental interest expense related to its $1 billion October 2015 note issuance and by continued pressure from foreign currency exchange rates.

Dividends and Share Repurchase

The company is increasing its annual ordinary dividend by 20%, to $2.40 per share from $2.00 per share. In addition, the company announced a special dividend of $2.00 per share. The quarterly ordinary dividend of $0.60 per share and the $2.00 special dividend will be paid on March 4, 2016, to shareholders of record on Feb. 19, 2016. This is the company’s 165th consecutive quarterly dividend.

Additionally, the company has authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program, which includes the remaining $17 million outstanding under the previous program. The company repurchased $483 million of stock in 2015. Repurchases will be made at the times, in the amounts and in the manner that the company believes appropriate.
