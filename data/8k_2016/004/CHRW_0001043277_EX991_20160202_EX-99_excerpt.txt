 (1) Includes Payment Services revenues which were previously reported separately.  

“Our team delivered great results in the fourth quarter and the full year in 2015,” said John Wiehoff, CEO and Chairman. “The growth in net revenue, net income and earnings per share represent the effectiveness of our network and the positive outcomes we are delivering for customers.”  

Our truckload net revenues increased 13.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Organic truckload net revenues increased approximately ten percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Our acquisition of Freightquote.com (“Freightquote”) on January 1, 2015 contributed approximately 3.5 percentage points to our truckload net revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our North American truckload volumes increased approximately five percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period of 2014. North American truckload volumes, excluding Freightquote,

 increased approximately two percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Our truckload net revenue margin increased in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, due primarily to lower transportation costs, including fuel. In North America, excluding the estimated impacts of the reduction in fuel costs, our average truckload rate per mile charged to our customers decreased approximately three percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. In North America, our truckload transportation costs decreased approximately five percent, excluding the estimated impacts of the reduction in fuel costs.  

Our less-than-truckload (“LTL”) net revenues increased 41.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Freightquote contributed approximately 32 percentage points to our LTL net revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2015. LTL volumes increased approximately 36 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Organic LTL volume increased approximately 17 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Net revenue margin increased in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. This was primarily the result of a change in our freight mix with more small customers from the higher margin Freightquote business.  

Our intermodal net revenues decreased 13.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, notwithstanding the increase in intermodal net revenues attributed to Freightquote. Conversion to truckload from intermodal negatively impacted intermodal volumes and net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015.  

Our ocean transportation net revenues decreased 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease in net revenues was primarily due to lower rates charged to our customers, offset partially by decreased costs and higher volumes.  

Our air transportation net revenues decreased 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was due to lower rates charged to our customers, partially offset by increased net revenue margin.  

Our customs net revenues decreased 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease was due to lower rates, partially offset by higher volume.  

Our other logistics services revenues, which includes managed services, warehousing, and small parcel, increased 16.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily from volume growth in managed services. Freightquote contributed approximately two percentage points to our other logistics services net revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2015.  

Sourcing net revenues increased 11.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to an increase in net revenue per case and a case volume increase of 4.5 percent across a variety of commodities and services.  

For the fourth quarter, operating expenses increased 13.4 percent to $356.2 million in 2015 from $314.1 million in 2014. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 62.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 from 62.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014.  

For the fourth quarter, personnel expenses increased 14.1 percent to $268.2 million in 2015 from $235.1 million in 2014. This was primarily due to an average headcount increase of 14.1 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Our acquisition of Freightquote contributed approximately nine percentage points of the growth in average headcount during the fourth quarter of 2015.

For the fourth quarter, other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 11.4 percent to $88.0 million in 2015 from $79.0 million in 2014. This increase was primarily due to our acquisition of Freightquote including amortization expense of approximately $1.9 million, and an increase in travel expenses.  

Interest and other expense increased during the fourth quarter of 2015 by $7.1 million. During the fourth quarter, we wrote off an indemnification asset related to the acquisition of Phoenix International Freight Services, Ltd., as the indemnifications expired. The impact of this write off was partially offset within the provision for income taxes by related tax liabilities that expired under applicable statute of limitations. These items decreased earnings per share by $0.02 in the fourth quarter.
