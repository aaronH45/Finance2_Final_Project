ITEM 5.03Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

On January 11, 2016, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Monsanto Company (the “Company”) approved and adopted an amendment and restatement (the “Amendment”) of Section 8A of the Company’s Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), the Company’s “proxy access” provision permitting eligible shareowners to have their own director nominees included in the Company’s proxy materials. As previously disclosed, in June 2015, the Company amended and restated the Bylaws to be an early adopter of proxy access following extensive shareowner outreach during the first half of 2015, when the views of the governance community on proxy access were still developing. As a result of the continued evolution of practice regarding proxy access implementation, the Board determined that it would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareowners to approve and adopt the Amendment, which eliminates certain restrictions and conditions on use of the proxy access provision by eligible shareowners of the Company.

The foregoing summary of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amended Bylaws. The amended Bylaws, along with a copy marked to show changes from the prior Bylaws, are included as Exhibits 3.2(i) and 3.2(ii), respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
