On February 26, 2016, the Board approved amendments to the Company’s Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), effective as of March 1, 2016, to implement new “proxy access” provisions that would apply to the Company’s annual meetings of stockholders. As amended, the Bylaws will permit eligible stockholders, including qualifying groups of up to 20 stockholders, that have continuously owned at least 3% of the Company’s outstanding common stock for at least three years to nominate director nominees constituting up to the greater of two directors and 20% of the number of directors serving on the Board, and to have such nominees included in the Company’s proxy materials, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the amended Bylaws and subject to the terms and conditions therein.  

The Bylaws were also amended to make various technical and administrative changes relating to the implementation of proxy access, including to clarify the application of plurality voting to contested elections with respect to proxy access nominations.  

The foregoing description of the Company’s Bylaws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
