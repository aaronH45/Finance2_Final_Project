Item 5.02.Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On February 1, 2016, CarMax, Inc. (the “Company”) announced that, as the culmination of a multi-year management succession plan, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) has approved changes to the Company’s senior management team effective February 1, 2016.

William D. Nash, formerly executive vice president, human resources and administrative services, has been promoted to president of the Company and William C. Wood, formerly executive vice president, stores, has been promoted to executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Company. 

Thomas J. Folliard will continue as the Company’s chief executive officer until his retirement, expected to occur prior to the end of 2016, at which time it is anticipated that Mr. Nash will assume the role of CEO. Upon Mr. Folliard’s retirement, the Board expects that he will serve as the non-executive chairman of the Board. 

Mr. Nash, 46, joined CarMax in 1997 as auction manager. In 2007, he was promoted to vice president and later, senior vice president of merchandising, a position he held until October 2011, when he was named senior vice president, human resources and administrative services. In March 2012, he was promoted to executive vice president, human resources and administrative services. Prior to joining CarMax, Mr. Nash worked at Circuit City.

Mr. Wood, 49, joined CarMax in 1993 as a buyer. He has served as buyer, purchasing manager, district manager, regional director and director of buyer development. He was promoted to vice president, merchandising in 1998, vice president of sales operations in 2007, senior vice president, sales in 2010, and senior vice president, stores in 2011. In March 2012, he was promoted to executive vice president, stores. Prior to joining CarMax, Mr. Wood worked at Circuit City.

In connection with his promotion, effective February 1, 2016, Mr. Nash’s base salary was increased to $800,000 and his target annual incentive bonus was increased from 75% to 100% of his base salary, which will be applied on a pro-rata basis for fiscal year 2016. 

A copy of the Company’s press release announcing the executive succession events is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference into this Item 5.02.

Item 5.03.Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

Effective February 1, 2016, the Board amended and restated the Company’s Bylaws (the “Amended Bylaws”) to separate the offices of chief executive officer and president in connection with the executive succession events described above in Item 5.02. The Amended Bylaws update Article IV to clarify the duties of the chief executive officer and provide for the separate appointment of the president. In addition, conforming changes have been made throughout the Amended Bylaws to clarify the roles of the chief executive officer and the president. 

The Amended Bylaws are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and are hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 5.03. The foregoing summary description of the Amended Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended Bylaws.
