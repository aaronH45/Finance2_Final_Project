 38 Non-GAAP Reconciliation ADJUSTEDEARNINGS Murphy defines Adjusted Earnings as net income adjusted to exclude discontinued operations and certain other items that affect comparability between periods.  Adjusted Earnings is used by management to evaluate the Company’s operational performance and trends between periods and relative to its industry competitors. Adjusted Earnings, as reported by Murphy, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and it should be considered in conjunction with net income, cash flow from operations and other performance measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Adjusted Earnings has certain limitations regarding financial assessments because it excludes certain items that affect net income. Adjusted Earnings should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of Murphy's GAAP results as reported.

 40 Non-GAAP Reconciliation EBITDA Murphy defines EBITDA as income from continuing operations before income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A), net interest expense, and impairment expense.  Management believes that EBITDA provides useful information for assessing Murphy's financial condition and results of operationsand it is a widely accepted financial indicator of the ability of a company to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditure programs, and pay dividends and make other distributions to stockholders. EBITDA per barrel is computed by taking EBITDA divided by total barrels of oil equivalents produced during the respective periods.  EBITDA, as reported by Murphy, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and it should be considered in conjunction with net income, cash flow from operations and other performance measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). EBITDA has certain limitations regarding financial assessments because it excludes certain items that affectnet income and net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of Murphy's GAAP results as reported. $ Millions  Twelve Months Ended –December 31, 2015  Twelve Months Ended –December 31, 2014   Income from continuingoperations   (2,255.8)  1,025.0   Incometax expense (benefit)  (1,026.5)  227.3   Interest expense, net of interest  capitalized  117.4  115.8   DD&Aexpense  1,619.8  1,906.2   Impairmentof assets  2,493.2  51.3   Consolidated EBITDA (Non-GAAP)  948.1*  3,325.6**   *Includes $155.1 MM pre-tax gain on sale of 10% interest in Malaysia in the twelve month period of 2015and $282.0 million pre-tax charge related to exit of deepwaterdrilling rig contracts. **Includes $144.8 million pre-tax gain on sale of 20% interest in Malaysia in the 2014 period.
