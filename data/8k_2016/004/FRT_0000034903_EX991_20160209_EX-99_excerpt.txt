Certain matters discussed within this Supplemental Information may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Although Federal Realty believes the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained. These factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 9, 2016, and include the following:

•risks that our tenants will not pay rent, may vacate early or may file for bankruptcy or that we may be unable to renew leases or re-let space at favorable rents as leases expire;

•risks that we may not be able to proceed with or obtain necessary approvals for any redevelopment or renovation project, and that completion of anticipated or ongoing property redevelopment or renovation projects that we do pursue may cost more, take more time to complete or fail to perform as expected;

•risk that we are investing a significant amount in ground-up development projects that may be dependent on third parties to deliver critical aspects of certain projects, requires spending a substantial amount upfront in infrastructure, and assumes receipt of public funding which has been committed but not entirely funded;

•risks normally associated with the real estate industry, including risks that occupancy levels at our properties and the amount of rent that we receive from our properties may be lower than expected, that new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected, that competition for acquisitions could result in increased prices for acquisitions, that costs associated with the periodic maintenance and repair or renovation of space, insurance and other operations may increase, that environmental issues may develop at our properties and result in unanticipated costs, and, because real estate is illiquid, that we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate;

•risks that our growth will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital;

•risks associated with general economic conditions, including local economic conditions in our geographic markets;

•risks of financing, such as our ability to consummate additional financings or obtain replacement financing on terms which are acceptable to us, our ability to meet existing financial covenants and the limitations imposed on our operations by those covenants, and the possibility of increases in interest rates that would result in increased interest expense; and

•risks related to our status as a real estate investment trust, commonly referred to as a REIT, for federal income tax purposes, such as the existence of complex tax regulations relating to our status as a REIT, the effect of future changes in REIT requirements as a result of new legislation, and the adverse consequences of the failure to qualify as a REIT.

FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND 

FULL YEAR 2015 OPERATING RESULTS

ROCKVILLE, Md. (February 9, 2016) - Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) today reported operating results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2015. Highlights of the quarter and year end recent activity include:

•Generated FFO per diluted share of $1.37 for the quarter, an increase of 7.0% over fourth quarter 2014. For the year, generated FFO per diluted share (excluding prepayment premiums) of $5.32, an increase of 7.7% over 2014. 

•Generated same center property operating income growth of 3.8% for the year (or 2.4% when properties under redevelopment are excluded). For the fourth quarter, same center growth was 2.6% (or 1.0% when properties under redevelopment are excluded), reflecting lower occupancy due to the recapture of significant anchor spaces in the same center pool. 

•Federal Realty’s same-center portfolio was 95.4% leased on December 31, 2015, compared to 96.0% on September 30, 2015 and 96.5% on December 31, 2014.

•Signed leases for 380,714 sf of comparable space at an average rent of $31.88 psf and achieved cash basis rollover growth on comparable spaces of 23%.

•Sold Courtyard Shops in Wellington, Florida, for $52.8 million and, subsequent to year-end, acquired our JV partner’s 70% interest in our unconsolidated real estate partnership for $153.7 million. 

•Affirmed 2016 FFO per diluted share guidance range of $5.65 to $5.71.

“The fourth quarter and the full year represented yet another record for the Trust in terms of FFO per share” commented Donald C. Wood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Federal Realty. “We are excited about the opportunity to gain control of below market anchor space within the core portfolio and drive value through redevelopment and releasing. In addition, with the first phases of our mixed use developments delivering and the next phases well underway, infill acquisitions that will drive future growth opportunities, and strong leasing and rollover results, we continue to drive successfully all facets of our long term strategic plan.”

Financial Results

In the fourth quarter 2015, Federal Realty generated funds from operations available for common shareholders (FFO) of $96.5 million, or $1.37 per diluted share. This compares to FFO of $77.7 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2014. Excluding the early extinguishment of debt charge in fourth quarter 2014, FFO per diluted share was $1.28. For the full year 2015, Federal Realty reported FFO of $352.9 million, or $5.05 per diluted share, which includes the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding the early extinguishment of debt charges in both years, FFO would have been $371.9 million, or $5.32 per diluted share in 2015, compared to $338.1 million, or $4.94 per diluted share in 2014.

Net income available for common shareholders was $67.8 million and earnings per diluted share was $0.97 for fourth quarter 2015 versus $35.0 million and $0.51, respectively, for fourth quarter 2014. For the full year 2015, Federal Realty reported net income available for common shareholders of $209.7 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.03. This compares to net income available for common shareholders of $164.0 million and earnings per diluted share of $2.41 for the full year 2014. 

FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental earnings measure which the Trust considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is attached to this press release in addition to Form 8-K that was filed.

Portfolio Results

Same-center property operating income for full year 2015 increased 3.8% including redevelopments and expansions, and 2.4% excluding redevelopments and expansions compared to 2014. On a quarterly-basis, same-center property operating income in fourth quarter 2015 increased 2.6% including redevelopment and expansion properties, and 1.0% excluding redevelopment and expansion properties, which reflects lower occupancy due to the recapture of significant anchor spaces in the same center pool.

The overall portfolio was 94.3% leased as of December 31, 2015, compared to 95.5% on September 30, 2015 and 95.6% on December 31, 2014. Federal Realty’s same-center portfolio was 95.4% leased on December 31, 2015, compared to 96.0% on September 30, 2015 and 96.5% on December 31, 2014.

During fourth quarter 2015, the Trust signed 99 leases for 439,061 square feet of retail space. On a comparable space basis (i.e., spaces for which there was a former tenant), the Trust leased 380,714 square feet at an average cash-basis contractual rent increase per square foot (i.e., excluding the impact of straight-line rents) of 23%. The average contractual rent on this comparable space for the first year of the new lease is $31.88 per square foot compared to the average contractual rent of $26.00 per square foot for the last year of the prior lease. The previous average contractual rent is calculated by including both the minimum rent and any percentage rent actually paid during the last year of the lease term for the re-leased space. On a GAAP basis (i.e., including the impact of straight-line rents), rent increases per square foot for comparable retail space averaged 35% for fourth quarter 2015.

For all of 2015, Federal Realty signed 316 leases representing 1.4 million square feet of comparable retail space at an average cash-basis contractual rent increase per square foot of 17%, and 29% on a GAAP-basis. The average cash-basis contractual rent on this comparable space for the first year of the new lease is $30.90 per square foot compared to the average cash-basis contractual rent of $26.32 per square foot for the last year of the prior lease. As of December 31, 2015, Federal Realty’s average contractual minimum rent for retail and commercial space in its portfolio is $26.28 per square foot, as compared to $25.59 per square foot on December 31, 2014.

Notes:

(1)There is no guarantee that the Trust will ultimately complete any or all of these opportunities, that the Projected Return on Investment (ROI) or Projected Costs will be the amounts shown or that stabilization will occur as anticipated. The projected ROI and Projected Cost are management's best estimate based on current information and may change over time. 

(2)Projected ROI for redevelopment projects generally reflects only the deal specific cash, unleveraged incremental Property Operating Income (POI) generated by the redevelopment and is calculated as Incremental POI divided by incremental cost. Incremental POI is the POI generated by the redevelopment after deducting rent being paid or management's estimate of rent to be paid for the redevelopment space and any other space taken out of service to accommodate the redevelopment. Projected ROI for redevelopment projects does NOT include peripheral impacts, such as the impact on future lease rollovers at the property or the impact on the long-term value of the property.  

(3)Stabilization is the year in which 95% occupancy of the redeveloped space is achieved. 

(4)All subtotals and totals reflect cost weighted-average ROIs.

Notes:

(1)Anticipated opening dates, total cost, projected return on investment (ROI), anticipated stabilization, and significant tenants for centers under development are subject to adjustment as a result of factors inherent in the development process, some of which may not be under the direct control of the Trust. Refer to the Trust's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for other risk factors.

(2)Projected ROI for development projects reflects the deal specific cash, unleveraged Property Operating Income (POI) generated by the development and is calculated as POI divided by cost.

(3)Projected costs include an allocation of infrastructure costs for the entire project.

(4)Includes costs of which we have claims for recovery against 3rd parties.

Glossary of Terms

Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that means net income or loss plus depreciation and amortization, net interest expense, income taxes, gain or loss on sale of real estate, and impairments of real estate, if any. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because it approximates a key performance measure in our debt covenants, but it should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Funds From Operations (FFO): FFO is a supplemental measure of real estate companies' operating performances. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as follows: net income, computed in accordance with GAAP plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on sale of real estate. NAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure of performance and liquidity of an equity REIT in order to recognize that the value of income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. However, FFO does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income); should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance; and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to pay dividends. We consider FFO a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. 

In addition to FFO, we have also included FFO excluding the "early extinguishment of debt" charges which relate to the early redemption of our 6.20% senior notes in 2015, and our 5.65% senior notes and East Bay Bridge mortgage loan in 2014. We believe the unusual nature of these charges, being make-whole payments on the remaining principal and interest on the redeemed notes/mortgages, is worthy of separate evaluation and consequently have provided both relevant metrics.

Property Operating Income: Rental income, other property income and mortgage interest income, less rental expenses and real estate taxes and excluding operating results from discontinued operations.

Overall Portfolio: Includes all operating properties owned in reporting period.

Same Center: Information provided on a same center basis is provided for only those properties that were owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared, excludes properties that were redeveloped, expanded or under development and properties purchased or sold at any time during the periods being compared. 

Tenant Improvements and Incentives: Represents not only the total dollars committed for the improvement (fit-out) of a space as it relates to a specific lease and, except for redevelopments, may also include base building costs (i.e. expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable. Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements.
