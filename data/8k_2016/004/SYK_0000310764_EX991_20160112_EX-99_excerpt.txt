[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Preliminary net sales for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were $2.7 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively, increases of 3.7% and 2.8%, respectively. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions, preliminary net sales increased 6.4% in the fourth quarter and 6.1% for the full year. 

We have increased our full year adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $5.09 to $5.12, an increase of 7.6% to 8.2% over 2014. Our 2015 share repurchases totaled $700 million for the full year, with remaining open authorization of $1.9 billion. The full year negative foreign currency exchange impact was approximately $0.25 per share, while the fourth quarter includes a negative impact of approximately $0.04 per share. In the fourth quarter the Medical Device Excise Tax was suspended. The full year negative impact of this tax was approximately $0.13 per share in 2015.

"With 2015 organic sales growth of 6.1%, bolstered by a strong fourth quarter increase of 6.4%, our top line results came in at the high end of our expectations at the beginning of the year," said Kevin A. Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "This performance reflects the strength of our diversified revenue model, a commitment to innovation and the competitive advantage of our sales and marketing organizations. Our updated full year guidance range of adjusted EPS also exceeds our initial expectations, underscoring our commitment to delivering sales growth at the high end of med tech and leveraged earnings gains. With these results and the current momentum across our businesses we are well positioned as we head into 2016."
