Effective January 27, 2016, the Board of Directors of McGraw Hill Financial, Inc. (the "Company") amended and restated the Company's By-Laws (the "Amended and Restated By-Laws") to implement a proxy access by-law.

The Amended and Restated By-Laws also make clarifications, updates and other, non-substantive changes that are primarily intended to give the Company additional flexibility in conducting Board and Shareholder meetings and in addressing Director nominations or other business proposed by shareholders.

This description of the amendments to the By-Laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Amended and Restated By-Laws filed as Exhibit 3(ii) to this Report.
