All comparisons below are for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, unless otherwise noted.

Earnings

•Net interest income increased $230 million, or 8%, to $3.2 billion, primarily driven by strong loan receivables growth. Net interest income after retailer share arrangements increased 9%.

•Total platform revenue increased $131 million, or 5%. Platform revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 included a $46 million gain from portfolio sales.

•Provision for loan losses increased $26 million to $823 million largely due to loan receivables growth, partially offset by asset quality improvement.

•Other income decreased $75 million to $87 million, driven primarily by the $46 million gain from portfolio sales in the fourth quarter of 2014.

•Other expense increased $78 million to $870 million, primarily driven by investments in growth and infrastructure build associated with the separation from GE.

•Net earnings totaled $547 million for the quarter compared to $531 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The fourth quarter of 2014 included a $29 million after-tax gain associated with portfolio sales.

Balance Sheet

Key Financial Metrics
