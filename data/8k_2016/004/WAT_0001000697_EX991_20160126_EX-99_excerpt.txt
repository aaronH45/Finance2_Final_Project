CAUTIONARY STATEMENT  

This release may contain “forward-looking” statements regarding future results and events. For this purpose, any statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words, “feels”, “believes”, “anticipates”, “plans”, “expects”, “intends”, “suggests”, “appears”, “estimates”, “projects”, and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The Company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements within this release for a variety of reasons, including and without limitation, foreign exchange rate fluctuations potentially affecting translation of the Company’s future non-U.S. operating results; the impact on demand among the Company’s various market sectors from economic, sovereign and political uncertainties; fluctuations in expenditures by the Company’s customers, in particular large pharmaceutical companies; introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share; pressures on prices from competitors and/or customers; regulatory, economic and competitive obstacles to new product introductions; other changes in demand from the effect of mergers and acquisitions by the Company’s customers; uncertainties relating to organizational/leadership changes; increased regulatory burdens as the Company’s business evolves, especially with respect to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, among others; shifts in taxable income in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates; the outcome of tax examinations or changes in respective country legislation affecting the Company’s effective tax rate; the ability to access capital, maintain liquidity and service our debt in volatile market conditions, particularly in the U.S., as a large portion of the Company’s cash is held and operating cash flows are generated outside the U.S.; environmental and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of products and risks associated with lawsuits and other legal actions, particularly involving claims for infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights. Such factors and others are discussed more fully in the sections entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” of the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and Form 10-Q for the period ended October 3, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” discussions are incorporated by reference in this release.

Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials  

(in thousands, except per share data)  

The 2015 and 2014 adjusted amounts presented below are used by the management of the Company to measure operating performance against prior periods and forecasts and are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These Non-GAAP amounts should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial performance in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that the use of Non-GAAP measures, such as Adjusted Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Adjusted Non-GAAP Operating Income, helps management and investors gain a better understanding of the Company’s core operating results, and is consistent with how management measures performance for purposes of executive compensation and forecasts the Company’s performance. The reconciliation identifies items management has excluded as non-operational items. Management has excluded the following items:  

   •   Purchased Intangibles Amortization was excluded to allow for comparisons of operating results that are consistent over periods of time.  

   •   Restructuring Costs, Asset Impairments, Acquisition-Related Costs and Other One-Time Costs were excluded as the Company believes that costs to consolidate operations, reduce overhead and complete acquisitions are infrequent or unusual and are not indicative of normal operating costs.  

   •   Acquired In-Process Research and Development was excluded as the Company believes that the costs to license certain intellectual property are infrequent and are not indicative of normal operating costs. In 2015 and 2014, the Company entered into licensing arrangements for mass spectrometry technologies, primarily related to new medically-focused applications.  

   •   Litigation Provisions were excluded as these costs are isolated, unpredictable and not expected to recur regularly.  

   •   Infrequent Income Tax Items were excluded as these costs and benefits are typically the result of audit examination settlements, updates in management’s assessment of ongoing examinations or other unusual tax items and are not indicative of the Company’s normal or future income tax expense.
