ITEM 1.01ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

On January 31, 2016, Stryker Corporation, a Michigan corporation (“Stryker”) and Star Acquisition Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Purchaser”) and wholly owned subsidiary of Stryker, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), with Sage Products Holdings II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Sage Holdings” and, together with its subsidiaries, “Sage Products”), and a syndicate of equity interest holders affiliated with Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, with Stryker entering into the Purchase Agreement solely for purposes of guaranteeing Purchaser’s obligations thereunder. 

On the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, Purchaser will acquire all of the outstanding equity interests in Sage Holdings for a purchase price of $2.775 billion in cash, subject to working capital and other closing adjustments. Consummation of the acquisition of Sage Products will not occur before April 1, 2016 without the consent of Purchaser, and is subject to the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, as well as other customary closing conditions, including the absence of any injunction or other legal prohibition on the completion of a sale, the absence of a material adverse effect on Sage Products, the completion of a pre-closing restructuring by affiliates of Sage Products, the accuracy of counterparty representations and warranties (generally subject to a material adverse effect standard, with certain exceptions), and counterparty compliance in all material respects with covenants and agreements contained in the Purchase Agreement. 

The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of each of the parties. The Purchase Agreement also contains customary covenants and agreements, including with respect to the operation of the business of Sage Products between signing and closing and the use of reasonable best efforts to consummate the transaction. 

The Purchase Agreement also contains indemnification rights of each party with respect to breaches of or inaccuracies in counterparty representations, warranties and covenants (subject to certain limitations). The Purchase Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the closing by mutual written consent of Purchaser and the seller representative party to the Purchase Agreement, and in other customary circumstances, including in the event that the acquisition is not consummated by July 29, 2016 (subject to certain exceptions).
