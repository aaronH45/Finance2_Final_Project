HIGHLIGHTED BY CONTINUED STRONG AND DIVERSIFIED GROWTH

•Revenues Grew 20% Year-Over-Year to More Than $157 Billion

•Operating Earnings Reached $11 Billion

•Cash Flows From Operations Exceeded $9.7 Billion

•Full Year Adjusted Net Earnings Were $6.45 Per Share

NEW YORK, NY (January 19, 2016) - UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, once again highlighted by broad-based growth and market share expansion. In 2015, UnitedHealthcare grew to serve more people while effectively managing for better outcomes at lower health care costs on behalf of its clients. Optum paired strong organic growth with strategic investments to contribute nearly 40 percent of UnitedHealth Group’s full year earnings from operations in 2015.

“The people of UnitedHealth Group are focused sharply on executing fully on 2016 commitments and delivering the highest quality experience for those we are privileged to serve. These efforts are reflected in continuing strong growth as we enter the new year,” said Stephen J. Hemsley, chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group.

The Company affirmed its 2016 financial outlook, including estimated revenues of more than $180 billion, rising net earnings growth to a range of $7.60 to $7.80 in adjusted earnings per share, and strong cash flows from operations in the range of $9.5 billion to $10 billion.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•UnitedHealth Group’s full year 2015 revenues of $157.1 billion grew 20 percent or $26.6 billion year-over-year. Revenue growth was broad-based and reflected growing market demand for the Company’s product and service offerings. UnitedHealthcare’s 2015 revenues grew 10 percent and Optum’s revenues grew 42 percent, with strong double-digit percentage revenue growth in each Optum segment.

•Full year 2015 earnings from operations were $11 billion and adjusted net earnings were $6.45 per share, including $1.40 per share in the fourth quarter. Full year and fourth quarter after-tax margins declined year-over-year to 3.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, due to the mix effect of strong growth in pharmacy care services and losses on individual exchange-compliant products and one state Medicaid contract. Excluding these losses from 2015 adjusted results, adjusted net earnings were $7.00 per share for the full year and $1.77 per share in the fourth quarter.

•Full year 2015 cash flows from operations grew 21 percent year-over-year and exceeded $9.7 billion, representing 166 percent of net earnings. Fourth quarter cash flows were $3.5 billion, a strong 280 percent of net earnings.

•The 2015 consolidated medical care ratios of 81.7 percent for full year and 82.7 percent in the fourth quarter were pressured by the individual exchange-compliant products. Prior year reserves developed favorably by a total of $320 million in 2015 compared to prior year reserve development of $420 million in 2014. Reserves developed favorably by a total of $250 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $100 million in the fourth quarter of last year.

•The full year 2015 operating cost ratio of 15.5 percent decreased 80 basis points year-over-year due to shifts in business mix and improvements in productivity. The fourth quarter 2015 operating cost ratio of 15.1 percent improved from 17.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, again reflecting the changing business mix.

•The full year 2015 tax rate of 42.6 percent and fourth quarter tax rate of 43.3 percent increased year-over-year by 80 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively, due to higher levels of nondeductible ACA fees.

•Fourth quarter 2015 days claims payable of 50 days increased 3 days year-over-year and were stable sequentially; the rising mix of government business drove a 2-day year-over-year increase in days sales outstanding to 14 days.

•The Company’s financial position remained strong at December 31, 2015, with a full year 2015 interest coverage ratio of 16 times and a debt to total capital ratio of 49 percent. Return on equity of 18 percent rose 1 percentage point from 2014.

•Full year 2015 earnings from operations for UnitedHealthcare of $6.8 billion decreased $238 million from 2014, as operating margins declined to 5.1 percent.

A fourth quarter reserve of $95 million was also established for expected future losses on a state Medicaid contract. Excluding these losses, UnitedHealthcare full year 2015 earnings from operations grew 8 percent year-over-year to $7.6 billion.

•Pro Forma Net Earnings and Earnings per Share

•Interest Coverage Ratio

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted and pro forma earnings per share and EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the use of adjusted earnings per share provides investors and management useful information about the earnings impact acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. The use of pro forma earnings per share provides investors and management useful information about the impacts of individual exchange-compliant insurance business, reserves related to the advance recognition of losses on individual exchange-compliant products and a state Medicaid contract as well as the earnings impact of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. Management also believes that the use of EBITDA-based coverage metrics provide investors and management with useful information relative to our debt level relative and about our ability to service debt. These non-GAAP measures do not reflect all of the expenses associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, one should not consider these measures in isolation.
