Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On February 22, 2016, Andrew Warren informed Discovery Communications, Inc. (the “Company”) that he was resigning from the Company effective December 31, 2016. The Company is commencing its search for a new Chief Financial Officer immediately. If the Company appoints a new Chief Financial Officer prior to Mr. Warren’s departure, Mr. Warren will continue to be employed by the Company in a different capacity until December 31, 2016. If Mr. Warren earlier terminates his employment without the Company’s consent, he will forfeit his rights to any severance compensation.

As part of his agreement to remain with the Company through December 31, 2016, the Company and Mr. Warren revised his Employment Agreement to eliminate the Company’s ability to terminate his employment without Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement) and to eliminate Mr. Warren’s ability to terminate his employment for Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement) due to a material reduction of his responsibilities. The Company has agreed to treat Mr. Warren’s termination as a Termination Without Cause by the Company under the Employment Agreement. No other provisions of Mr. Warren’s employment agreement were amended. The amendment to the Employment Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
