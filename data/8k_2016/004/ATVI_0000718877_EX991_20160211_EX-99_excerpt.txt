GAAP net revenues from digital channels were a record $724 million and represented a Q4 record 54% of the company’s total revenues, growing 34% year-over-year.

Operating margin at constant FXB was also ahead of 2012’s all-time high of 34%. Non-GAAP net revenues and EPS for the quarter were roughly flat versus prior year at constant FXB. 

Please refer to the tables at the back of this press release for a reconciliation of the company’s GAAP and non-GAAP results. 

Bobby Kotick, Chief Executive Officer of Activision Blizzard, said, “With our expected closing of the acquisition of King Digital later this month, we will have the largest game network in the world, with over 500 million users playing our games every month.A Our entertainment franchises, including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and soon Candy Crush, will reach people on mobile, console and desktop devices in almost every country in the world. This gives us the opportunity to engage our global audiences and create revenue streams from content and services. Our esports initiatives, enhanced by our recent acquisition of Major League Gaming, allow us to reward our players around the world for their dedication and investment in our games. We expect to generate approximately $6.25 billion in revenues and over $2.0 billion of operating income in 2016 and we will have over 9,000 of the most talented people making, marketing and selling great games around the world.” 

Selected Business Highlights: 

· At constant FXB, Activision Publishing’s 2015 non-GAAP operating income grew 30%, and revenues grew 7%. Average MAUsA for the year were up 20% year-over-year, reaching an all-time 

2 

Activision Blizzard Announces Q4 2015 Financial Results 

high, and digital revenues grew over 65%. Activision Publishing now has 4 of the top 10 games on next-generation consoles life-to-date, including Call of Duty®: Black Ops III at number one.1 

· Activision Publishing’s Call of Duty franchise revenues grew double digits year-over-year both for the full year and in Q4, ending the quarter with the highest MAUsA in franchise history. The strong performance was driven by Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which had the biggest entertainment opening weekend of 2015, and was the #1 console game globally for the calendar year.2 Call of Duty was the #1 franchise in North America for the seventh year in a row.1 Black Ops III also has the highest season pass attach rate for downloadable content in franchise history. The Call of Duty franchise has now surpassed 250 million units sold life-to-date worldwide with over $15 billion in total sales, including in-game content, since it first launched in 2003.2 

· Activision Publishing’s Destiny achieved record digital attach rates on its critically acclaimed Q3 expansion, The Taken King. Destiny’s 25+ million registered users have logged nearly 3 billion hours playing the game. 

· Activision Publishing’s casual titles, namely Q3 release Skylanders® SuperChargers and Q4 release Guitar Hero® Live, performed weaker than expected, we believe largely due to greater competition in the toys to life genre and due to the casual audience’s shift to mobile devices. 

·  Blizzard Entertainment reached an all-time high for MAUsA in 2015. Fourth quarter MAUsA were up nearly 25% year-over-year, reflecting strong engagement with the online player community. At constant FXB, Blizzard’s 2015 revenues are above 2014’s record results. 

· On November 6, 2015, Blizzard Entertainment revealed that Hearthstone®: Heroes of Warcraft™ had surpassed the 40 million-registered-player milestone. On November 12, 2015, Blizzard launched The League of Explorers™, the third adventure for the franchise, with 45 new cards. This Adventure sold over 20% more units as of the first 6 weeks after launch than the prior Adventure in the same time frame. As a result of this new content, and continued strength across platforms and geographies, Hearthstone hit all-time franchise highs in multiple categories, including MAUsA, at the end of Q4. 

·  On November 6, 2015, Blizzard Entertainment kicked off presales for Legion™, the upcoming expansion for World of Warcraft®. Pre-purchasers will receive the expansion’s level-100 character boost, as well as early access to the Demon Hunter class when available. World of Warcraft remains the #1 subscription-based MMORPG in the world. 

·  On November 10, 2015, Blizzard Entertainment launched Legacy of the Void™, the standalone third chapter of StarCraft® II, selling through over 1 million copies in the first 24 hours of launch. Legacy of the Void received multiple Strategy Game of the Year awards. At BlizzCon® on November 6, 2015, Blizzard announced plans for a series of standalone mission packs. 

·  At BlizzCon, Blizzard Entertainment announced Heroes of the Storm’s™ upcoming Arena mode, planned for release in 2016, featuring smaller maps and shorter sessions. Heroes of the Storm

Our outlook for 2016 includes King, assuming we receive the necessary regulatory approvals to allow us to complete the transaction, which is currently expected to close later this month. 

· On December 22, 2015, Activision Publishing announced that the field is set for the inaugural Call of Duty World League Pro Division, with 800 professional esports teams across the world vying for more than $3 million in cash prizes playing Call of Duty: Black Ops III, culminating with the Call of Duty Championship presented by PlayStation 4 in the fall of 2016. 

· On February 2, 2016, Activision Publishing launched the first of four map packs for Call of Duty: Black Ops III, delivering four new, epic multiplayer maps in addition to an all-new Zombies experience, available first on PlayStation 4.

Esports fans will be able to follow the action on ESPN networks, who will once again deliver live coverage of the events on television and digital platforms. 

· Blizzard Entertainment’s team-based shooter, Overwatch™, will be coming to PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in spring of 2016.

1 The NPD Group 

2 The NPD Group, GfK Chart-Track and Activision Blizzard internal estimates 

A Monthly Active User (MAU) Definition: We monitor MAUs as a key measure of the overall size of our user base and their regular engagement with our portfolio of games. MAUs are the number of individuals who played a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing by the number of months in the period. An individual who plays two of our games would be counted as two users. For Activision and King MAUs, an individual who plays the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users due to technical limitations. For Blizzard MAUs, an individual who plays the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as one user. 

B Constant FX Definition: Constant FX provides current period results converted into USD using the average exchange rates from the comparative prior periods rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective current periods. We have provided various measurements at constant FX. Refer to the tables at the back of this press release for a reconciliation of the company’s GAAP and non-GAAP results. For the full year and fourth quarter of 2015, we estimated $364 million and $125 million exchange rate impacts on non-GAAP revenues, respectively, and $0.28 and $0.11 on non-GAAP EPS, respectively. Exchange rates impact our non-GAAP operating margins by approximately 240 basis points for the full year 2015. For the full year 2015, we estimated $169 million and $111 million exchange rate impacts on Activision Publishing’s non-GAAP revenues and operating income. For the full year 2015, we estimated $170 million exchange rate impacts on Blizzard’s non-GAAP revenues. 

No Profit Forecasts: Other than the specific information relating to the combined outlook for Activision Blizzard and King Digital Entertainment for 2016 set out in this press release, no statement in this press release is intended to constitute a profit forecast for any period, nor should any statements be interpreted to mean that earnings or earnings per share will necessarily be greater or lesser than those for the relevant preceding financial periods for Activision Blizzard and/or King 

6

Digital Entertainment, as appropriate. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures: As a supplement to our financial measures presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), Activision Blizzard presents certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as more important than, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the items associated with the company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. 

Activision Blizzard provides net revenues, net income (loss), earnings (loss) per share and operating margin data and guidance both including (in accordance with GAAP) and excluding (non-GAAP) certain items. When relevant, the Company also provides constant FX information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In addition, Activision Blizzard provides EBITDA (defined as GAAP net income (loss) before interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and adjusted EBITDA (defined as non-GAAP operating margin (see non-GAAP financial measure below) before depreciation). The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items, as applicable in any given reporting period: 

· the change in deferred revenues and related cost of sales with respect to certain of the company’s online-enabled games; 

· expenses related to stock-based compensation; 

· the amortization of intangibles from purchase price accounting; 

· fees and other expenses (including legal fees, costs, expenses and accruals) related to the acquisition of 429 million shares of our common stock on October 11, 2013 from Vivendi, pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated July 25, 2013 and the $4.75 billion debt financings related thereto; 

· fees and other expenses related to acquisitions, including the acquisition of King Digital Entertainment, and the debt financings related thereto; and 

· the income tax adjustments associated with any of the above items. 

In the future, Activision Blizzard may also consider whether other items should also be excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures used by the company. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional useful information to measure Activision Blizzard’s financial and operating performance. In particular, the measures facilitate comparison of operating performance between periods and help investors to better understand the operating results of Activision Blizzard by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company’s core business, operating results or future outlook. Internally, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the company’s operating results, and measuring compliance with the requirements of the company’s debt financing agreements, as well as in planning and forecasting. 

Activision Blizzard’s non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, and the terms non-GAAP net revenues, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP or adjusted EBITDA do not have a standardized meaning. Therefore, other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors a comparable view of Activision Blizzard’s performance in relation to other companies. 

In addition to the reasons stated above, which are generally applicable to each of the items Activision Blizzard excludes from its non-GAAP financial measures, there are additional specific reasons why the company believes it is appropriate to exclude the change in deferred revenues and related cost of sales with respect to certain of the company’s online-enabled games. 

Since Activision Blizzard has determined that some of our games’ online functionality represents an essential component of gameplay and, as a result, a more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable, we recognize revenues attributed to these game titles over their estimated service periods, which may range from five months to a maximum of less than a year. The related cost of sales is deferred and recognized as the related revenues are recognized. Internally, management excludes the impact of this change in deferred revenues and related cost of sales in its non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the company’s operating performance, when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, and when assessing the 

7 

Activision Blizzard Announces Q4 2015 Financial Results 

performance of its management team. Management believes this is appropriate because doing so enables an analysis of performance based on the timing of actual transactions with our customers, which is consistent with the way the company is measured by investment analysts and industry data sources. In addition, excluding the change in deferred revenues and the related cost of sales provides a much more timely indication of trends in our operating results.

The forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to the Company, including information provided to the Company by King Digital Entertainment and our preliminary assessment on the impact to our financial information of purchase price accounting, as of the date of this press release and, while believed to be true when made, may ultimately prove to be incorrect. The Company may change its intention, belief or expectation, at any time and without notice, based upon any changes in such factors, in the Company’s assumptions or otherwise. The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the original date of this press release, February 11, 2016.
