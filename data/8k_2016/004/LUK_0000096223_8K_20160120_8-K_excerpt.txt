Item 5.02. Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

On January 20, 2016, our Compensation Committee approved 2015-related bonuses for certain of our executive officers, which are set forth below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Messrs. Handler and Friedman’s $6 million individual bonuses were based solely on Leucadia’s fiscal 2015 results, excluding Jefferies. Jefferies’ fiscal 2015 results fell below the required threshold amounts for any bonus payment and also resulted in Messrs. Handler and Friedman forfeiting 294,978 Leucadia shares (valued at approximately $4.9 million based on yesterday’s stock price). 

The Compensation Committee also granted a performance-based restricted stock award to Mr. Sharp in the amount of $1 million.
