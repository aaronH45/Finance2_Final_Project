“Aetna achieved record annual operating revenue and operating earnings in 2015, and delivered full-year operating EPS that was above our most recent projection,” said Mark T. Bertolini, Aetna chairman and CEO. “Aetna’s strong 2015 results speak to our continued focus on disciplined pricing and execution of our growth strategy. Based on this performance, we are projecting 2016 operating earnings per share of at least $7.75.

“We continue to work diligently with the Department of Justice and state regulators toward final approval of our proposed acquisition of Humana, and we continue to advance our integration readiness plans. We have obtained seven of the necessary state approvals, and we believe we remain on track to close the transaction in the second half of 2016,” said Bertolini.

“We are quite pleased with the strength of our fourth quarter and full year results,” said Shawn M. Guertin, Aetna executive vice president and CFO. “Aetna’s operating results continue to be supported by strong cash flow and operating margins.

“Our Government business saw strong growth in membership and premiums, as well as improved underwriting margins. These reflect our ongoing execution of strategies to improve our

margin profile in Medicare, as well as strong performance in our Medicaid business,” said Guertin.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Full-year 2015 operating earnings (1) for Health Care were $2.7 billion, compared with $2.4 billion in 2014. Operating earnings increased primarily as a result of higher underwriting margins in Aetna's Government business, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses. Full-year 2015 net income for Health Care was $2.4 billion compared with $2.2 billion in 2014.

Group Insurance segment results

Group Insurance, which includes group life, disability and long-term care products, reported:

Full-year 2015 operating earnings (1) for Group Insurance were $136.0 million, compared with $171.0 million in 2014. Operating earnings for 2015 decreased compared with 2014, primarily due to lower underwriting margins in Aetna's Long-Term Care and Life products as well as lower net investment income, partially offset by higher underwriting margins in Aetna's Disability products. Full-year 2015 net income (2) for Group Insurance was $135.5 million, compared with $179.6 million in 2014.

Large Case Pensions segment results 

Large Case Pensions, which manages a variety of discontinued and other retirement and savings products, primarily for qualified pension plans, reported:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Dental ASC membership at December 31, 2014 has been revised to reflect a reduction of approximately 1 million Dental ASC members, as the applicable Medicaid ASC members did not have a Dental ASC product at such date. This revision did not affect Aetna's financial statements.

*Interest expense of $50.8 million ($78.1 million pretax) and $203.8 million ($313.5 million pretax), for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, each exclude costs associated with the bridge credit agreement and term loan credit agreement executed in connection with the proposed acquisition of Humana Inc. (“Humana”). These costs are included within transaction, integration-related and restructuring costs.

Aetna/14

(1) Operating earnings and operating earnings per share exclude from net income attributable to Aetna and operating expenses and operating revenues exclude, as applicable, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of Aetna's business nor reflect Aetna's underlying business performance. Although the excluded items may recur, management believes that operating earnings, operating earnings per share, operating revenues, operating expenses and the operating expense ratio provide a more useful comparison of Aetna's underlying business performance from period to period. Management uses operating earnings to assess business performance and to make decisions regarding Aetna's operations and the allocation of resources among Aetna's businesses. Operating earnings is also the measure reported to the Chief Executive Officer for these purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures Aetna discloses, such as operating earnings, operating earnings per share, operating earnings per share baseline, operating revenues, operating expenses, pretax operating margin and the operating expense ratio, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).

For the periods covered in this press release, the following items are excluded from operating earnings, operating expenses and operating revenues, as applicable, because Aetna believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of Aetna's business nor reflect Aetna's underlying business performance: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•During 2014, Aetna enhanced its tax-qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (the “Aetna Pension Plan”) to allow certain current and former employees to elect a 100% lump-sum distribution. In addition, Aetna also announced a limited-time offer permitting certain former employees with deferred vested balances to elect a 100% lump-sum distribution. The distributions in 2014 were funded from existing Aetna Pension Plan assets, and Aetna recorded a related non-cash settlement charge of $72.5 million ($111.6 million pretax) during 2014 in general and administrative expenses.

•Aetna recorded a charge of $78.0 million ($120.0 million pretax) during the year ended December 31, 2012 related to the settlement of purported class action litigation regarding Aetna's payment practices related to out-of-network health care providers. That charge included the estimated cost of legal fees of plaintiffs' counsel and the costs of administering the settlement. During the year ended December 31, 2014, Aetna exercised its right to terminate the settlement agreement. As a result, Aetna released the reserve established in connection with the settlement agreement, net of amounts due to the settlement administrator, which reduced general and administrative expenses by $67.0 million ($103.0 million pretax) in the year ended December 31, 2014.

•Other acquired intangible assets relate to Aetna's acquisition activities and are amortized over their useful lives. However, this amortization does not directly relate to the underwriting or servicing of products for customers and is not directly related to the core performance of Aetna's business operations.

•Net realized capital gains and losses arise from various types of transactions, primarily in the course of managing a portfolio of assets that support the payment of liabilities. However, these transactions do not directly relate to the underwriting or servicing of products for customers and are not directly related to the core performance of Aetna's business operations.

For a reconciliation of these items to financial measures calculated under GAAP, refer to the tables on pages 9 through 11 and 13 of this press release.

Aetna's full year 2015 operating earnings per share baseline is approximately $7.04. This baseline excludes from operating earnings per share the net impact of favorable development of prior years' health care cost estimates and contractual premium reductions of approximately $0.77 per share and the unfavorable impact of accruals related to 2014 for Health Care Reform's reinsurance, risk adjustment and risk corridor programs of approximately $0.10 per share.

(2)  Net Income (Loss) refers to net income (loss) attributable to Aetna reported in Aetna's GAAP Consolidated Statements of Income. Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this press release to operating earnings, operating earnings per share, net 

Aetna/15

income (loss) and net income per share are based upon net income (loss) attributable to Aetna, which excludes amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.

(3) Operating revenue excludes net realized capital gains and losses and an other item as noted in (1) above. Refer to the tables on pages 10, 11 and 13 of this press release for a reconciliation of operating revenue to total revenue calculated under GAAP. 

(4) Projected 2016 operating earnings per share exclude from net income estimated after-tax amortization of other acquired intangible assets of approximately $160 million ($247 million pretax), projected integration-related costs related to the Coventry and bswift acquisitions and the proposed Humana acquisition, projected transaction-related costs related to the proposed Humana acquisition, any future net realized capital gains and losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of Aetna's business nor reflect Aetna's underlying business performance. After-tax amortization of other acquired intangible assets relates to Aetna's acquisition activities, including Coventry, InterGlobal and bswift. Aetna is not able to project the amount of future net realized capital gains and losses or any such other items (other than estimated after-tax amortization of other acquired intangible assets and projected transaction and integration-related costs related to the Coventry and bswift acquisitions and the proposed Humana acquisition) and therefore cannot reconcile projected operating earnings per share to projected net income per share in any period. Projected full-year 2016 operating earnings per share reflect a range of 354 million to 355 million weighted average diluted shares. The projected information in this press release does not include or reflect any benefit or impact from or any transaction or other costs associated with Aetna's proposed acquisition of Humana.

(5) The operating expense ratio excludes net realized capital gains and losses and other items, if any, that are excluded from operating revenues or operating expenses, as noted in (1) above. For a reconciliation of this metric to the comparable GAAP measure refer to page 11 of this press release.

(6) In order to provide useful information regarding Aetna's profitability on a basis comparable to others in the industry, without regard to financing decisions, income taxes or amortization of other acquired intangible assets (each of which may vary for reasons not directly related to the performance of the underlying business), Aetna's pretax operating margin is based on operating earnings excluding interest expense and income taxes. Management also uses pretax operating margin to assess Aetna's performance, including performance versus competitors. 

(7) Operating revenue and operating expense information is presented before income taxes. Operating earnings information is presented net of income taxes. 

(8) Aetna's Corporate Financing segment is not a business segment. It is added to Aetna's business segments to reconcile segment reporting to Aetna's consolidated results. The net loss of the Corporate Financing segment includes interest expense on Aetna's outstanding debt and the financing components of Aetna's pension and other postretirement employee benefit plan expenses (benefits). As described in (1) above, the operating earnings of the Corporate Financing segment exclude other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of Aetna's business nor reflect Aetna's underlying business performance.

(9) Medicaid membership includes members who are dually-eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.

(10) Represents members in consumer-directed health plans included in Commercial medical membership.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. You can generally identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “explore,” “evaluate,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” or “will,” or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Aetna’s and Humana’s control.

Statements in this press release regarding Aetna that are forward-looking, including Aetna’s projections as to operating earnings per share, the closing date of the proposed Humana acquisition, amortization of other acquired intangible assets and weighted average diluted shares are based on management’s estimates, assumptions and projections, and are subject to significant uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Aetna’s and Humana’s control. Important risk factors could cause actual future results and other future events to differ materially from those currently estimated by management, including, but not limited to: the timing to consummate the proposed Humana acquisition; the risk that a condition to closing of the proposed Humana acquisition may not be satisfied; the risk that a regulatory approval that may be required for the proposed Humana acquisition is delayed, is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the outcome of various litigation matters related to the proposed Humana acquisition; Aetna’s ability to achieve the synergies and value creation projected to be realized following the completion of the proposed Humana acquisition; Aetna’s ability to promptly and effectively integrate Humana’s businesses; the diversion of management time on acquisition-related issues; unanticipated increases in medical costs (including increased intensity or medical utilization as a result of flu or otherwise; changes in membership mix to higher cost or lower-premium products or membership adverse selection; medical cost increases resulting from unfavorable changes in contracting or re-contracting with providers (including as a result of provider consolidation and/or integration); and increased pharmacy costs (including in Aetna’s and/or Humana’s health insurance exchange products)); the profitability of 

Aetna/16

Aetna’s and Humana’s public health insurance exchange products, where membership (particularly members who join outside of the annual enrollment period) may have more adverse health status and/or higher medical benefit utilization than Aetna and/or Humana projected; uncertainty related to Aetna’s and Humana’s accruals for health care reform’s reinsurance, risk adjustment and risk corridor programs (“3R’s”); the implementation of health care reform legislation, including collection of health care reform fees, assessments and taxes through increased premiums; adverse legislative, regulatory and/or judicial changes to or interpretations of existing health care reform legislation and/or regulations (including those relating to minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”) rebates); the implementation of health insurance exchanges; Aetna’s and Humana’s ability to offset Medicare Advantage and PDP rate pressures; and changes in Aetna’s and Humana’s future cash requirements, capital requirements, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Health care reform will continue to significantly impact Aetna’s business operations and financial results, including Aetna’s pricing and medical benefit ratios. Key components of the legislation will continue to be phased in through 2020, and Aetna will be required to dedicate material resources and incur material expenses during 2016 to implement health care reform. Significant parts of the legislation, including aspects of public health insurance exchanges, nondiscrimination requirements, reinsurance, risk corridor and risk adjustment continue to evolve through the promulgation of regulations and guidance at the federal level. In addition, pending efforts in the U.S. Congress to amend or restrict funding for various aspects of health care reform, and pending litigation challenging aspects of the law continue to create additional uncertainty about the ultimate impact of health care reform. As a result, many of the impacts of health care reform will not be known for the next several years. Other important risk factors include: adverse changes in health care reform and/or other federal or state government policies or regulations as a result of health care reform or otherwise (including legislative, judicial or regulatory measures that would affect Aetna’s and/or Humana’s business model, restrict funding for or amend various aspects of health care reform, limit Aetna’s and/or Humana’s ability to price for the risk it assumes and/or reflect reasonable costs or profits in its pricing, such as mandated minimum medical benefit ratios, or eliminate or reduce ERISA pre-emption of state laws (increasing Aetna’s and/or Humana’s potential litigation exposure)); adverse and less predictable economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad (including unanticipated levels of, or increases in the rate of, unemployment); reputational or financial issues arising from Aetna’s and/or Humana’s social media activities, data security breaches, other cybersecurity risks or other causes; Aetna’s ability to diversify Aetna’s sources of revenue and earnings (including by developing, operating and expanding Aetna's consumer business and expanding Aetna’s foreign operations), transform Aetna’s business model, develop new products and optimize Aetna’s business platforms; the success of Aetna’s Healthagen® (including Accountable Care Solutions and health information technology) initiatives; adverse changes in size, product or geographic mix or medical cost experience of membership; managing executive succession and key talent retention, recruitment and development; failure to achieve and/or delays in achieving desired rate increases and/or profitable membership growth due to regulatory review or other regulatory restrictions, the difficult economy and/or significant competition, especially in key geographic areas where membership is concentrated, including successful protests of business awarded to Aetna and/or Humana; failure to adequately implement health care reform; the outcome of various litigation and regulatory matters, including audits, challenges to Aetna’s and/or Humana’s minimum MLR rebate methodology and/or reports, guaranty fund assessments, intellectual property litigation and litigation concerning, and ongoing reviews by various regulatory authorities of, certain of Aetna’s and/or Humana’s payment practices with respect to out-of-network providers, other providers and/or life insurance policies; Aetna’s ability to integrate, simplify, and enhance Aetna’s existing products, processes and information technology systems and platforms to keep pace with changing customer and regulatory needs; Aetna’s ability to successfully integrate Aetna’s businesses (including Humana, Coventry, bswift LLC and other businesses Aetna may acquire in the future) and implement multiple strategic and operational initiatives simultaneously; Aetna’s and/or Humana’s ability to manage health care and other benefit costs; adverse program, pricing, funding or audit actions by federal or state government payors, including as a result of sequestration and/or curtailment or elimination of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ star rating bonus payments; Aetna’s ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating performance; failure by a service provider to meet its obligations to Aetna or Humana; Aetna’s and Humana’s ability to develop and maintain relationships (including collaborative risk-sharing agreements) with providers while taking actions to reduce medical costs and/or expand the services each company offers; Aetna’s ability to demonstrate that Aetna’s products and processes lead to access to quality affordable care by Aetna’s members; Aetna’s and/or Humana’s ability to maintain their relationships with third-party brokers, consultants and agents who sell their products; increases in medical costs or Group Insurance claims resulting from any epidemics, acts of terrorism or other extreme events; changes in medical cost estimates due to the necessary extensive judgment that is used in the medical cost estimation process, the considerable variability inherent in such estimates, and the sensitivity of such estimates to changes in medical claims payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends; a downgrade in Aetna’s financial ratings; and adverse impacts from any failure to raise the U.S. Federal government’s debt ceiling or any sustained U.S. Federal government shut down. For more discussion of important risk factors that may materially affect Aetna, please see the risk factors contained in Aetna’s 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Aetna’s 2014 Annual Report”) and Aetna's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 (“Aetna's September 2015 Quarterly Report”), each on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
