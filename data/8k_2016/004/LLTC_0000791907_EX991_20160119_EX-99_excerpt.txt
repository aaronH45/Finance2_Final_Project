 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS SEQUENTIAL INCREASES IN REVENUE AND NET INCOME. THE COMPANY INCREASES THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND $0.02 TO $0.32 PER SHARE  

 Milpitas, California, January 19, 2016, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ:LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the fiscal quarter ended January 3, 2016. Quarterly revenues of $347.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 increased $5.2 million or 1.5% over the previous quarter's revenue of $341.9 million and decreased $5.4 million or 1.5% from $352.6 million reported in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. Net income of $121.5 million increased $9.5 million or 8.5% over the previous quarter’s net income of $112.0 million and decreased $2.1 million or 1.7% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. Diluted earnings per share of $0.50 per share in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 increased $0.04 per share or 9% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 and decreased $0.01 per share or 2% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. Net income and diluted earnings per share increased on a sequential basis primarily due to the increase in revenue and a lower tax rate from the permanent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.  

 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $62.7 million over the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 to $1.31 billion. The Company's Board of Directors approved an increase in the Company's quarterly dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.32 per share. This marked the 24th consecutive year the Company has increased its dividend. A cash dividend of $0.32 per share will be paid on February 24, 2016 to stockholders of record on February 12, 2016. During the second quarter the Company generated positive cash flows from operations of $157.0 million or 45% of total revenues. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 the Company returned $96.1 million to shareholders in the form of dividends of $73.5 million, representing $0.30 per share, and stock purchases of $22.6 million totaling 0.5 million shares.  

 According to Lothar Maier, CEO, “Revenue for the quarter came in at the midpoint of our guidance as we grew revenues 1.5% over the September quarter to $347.1 million as we saw an improvement in sales into the transportation market. Earnings per share were $0.50, up from $0.46 per share as the permanent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in the December quarter added $0.04 due to the lower tax rate. Gross margin improved to 75.7% of sales, though operating expenses were higher due in part to an extra week of expenses included in the December quarter as fiscal 2016 is a 53 week fiscal year.   

 Looking ahead, it remains difficult to forecast in the current environment. The macroeconomic climate does not appear to have improved noticeably and our largest market, Industrial, remains weak in most regions. However, it is our belief that the inventory correction that began at the end of our fiscal year is mostly behind us and demand overall has picked up. Our book to bill ratio for the December quarter was positive and bookings through the early part of the current quarter have improved modestly aided by a pick up in the Transportation and Industrial markets while at the same time we are not impacted much at all by the current consumer weakness that others may be experiencing. As a result, for our fiscal third quarter we are forecasting revenue to be up 2% to 5% sequentially.”
