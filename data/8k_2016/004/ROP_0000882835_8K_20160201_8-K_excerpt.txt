Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. 

On February 1, 2016, Roper Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release containing information about the Company's results of operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1. In the press release, the Company uses several non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP Revenue, non-GAAP Gross Profit, non-GAAP Operating Margin, non-GAAP Net Income, non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share, EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. 

Business combination accounting rules required Roper to account for the fair value of deferred revenue assumed in connection with the 2014 acquisitions of Foodlink and Strategic Healthcare Programs and the 2015 acquisitions of Data Innovations, SoftWriters, Strata Decision Technology, OnCenter Software, Aderant and Atlas Database Software. The fair value is based on the assumed cost of having a third-party provide the relevant support services rather than the contracted amount under the contracts. Because the fair value is less than the contracted amount, Roper's GAAP revenues for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition will not reflect the full amount of revenue that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired companies had they remained independent companies. The Adjusted Revenue measure is intended to reflect the full amount that would have been recognized as revenue, absent the fair value adjustment. 

Business combination accounting rules require Roper to increase the carrying value of inventory acquired to fair value at the date of purchase (inventory step-up). Roper's GAAP gross profit for the two quarters subsequent to the acquisitions of Innovative Product Achievements in the third quarter of 2014 and RF IDeas in the third quarter of 2015 did not reflect the full amount of gross profit that would have otherwise been recorded by these entities had they remained independent companies. The Adjusted Gross Profit measure is intended to reflect the full amount that would have been recognized by these companies, absent the fair value adjustment. 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company divested its Abel business at a gain, and also recorded an impairment charge on a minority investment. The adjusted Net Earnings is intended to reflect the amount that would have been recognized, absent the gain on the Abel sale and the impairment charge. 

The non-GAAP Revenue, non-GAAP Gross Profit, non-GAAP Operating Margin, non-GAAP Net Income and non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share reflect these adjustments. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors as a measure of the ongoing performance of its business. 

EBITDA as shown in the press release is defined as net earnings plus (a) interest expense, (b) income taxes and (c) depreciation and amortization. The Company believes EBITDA is an important indicator of operational performance of the Company's business because it provides a link between profitability and operating cash flow. EBITDA as calculated by the Company is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In addition, EBITDA: (a) does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP; (b) is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the Company's cash flow needs; and (c) should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or the Company's other financial information determined under GAAP. The Company believes that the line on the Company's consolidated statement of operations entitled net earnings is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA.  

Free Cash Flow is defined as "Cash Provided by Operating Activities" ("Operating Cash Flow") as stated in Roper's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, reduced by capital expenditures. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a basis for comparing its performance with other companies. Roper's measure of Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
