ITEM 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On February 18, 2016, Perrigo Company plc (the “Company”) released earnings for the fourth calendar quarter of 2015. The press release related to the Company’s earnings is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

The earnings release contains certain non-GAAP measures. A “non-GAAP financial measure” is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the company. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation for net sales on a constant currency basis, cost of sales, gross profit, operating expenses, operating income, interest expense, net, other expense, net, Loss on extinguishment of debt, income before income taxes, income tax expense, net income, diluted weighted average shares outstanding, diluted earnings per share, gross margin, operating margin and operating expenses as a percent of sales within its earnings release to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for these non-GAAP measures. 

The Company excludes the items listed below in the applicable period when monitoring and evaluating the on-going financial results and trends of its business, and believes that presenting operating results excluding these items is also useful for investors, since it provides important insight into the Company's on-going core business operations on a normalized basis. Management uses adjusted financial data for planning and forecasting in future periods, including trending and analyzing the core operating performance of the Company’s business from period to period without the effect of the non-core business items indicated. Management also uses adjusted financial data to prepare operating budgets and forecasts and to measure the Company’s performance against those budgets and forecasts on a corporate and segment level.
