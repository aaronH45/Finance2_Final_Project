Dominion Announces Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2015 Earnings 

  ·   Fourth-quarter 2015 operating earnings of $0.70 per share     

  ·   Mild weather reduced fourth-quarter 2015 operating earnings by $0.08 per share     

  ·   Company introduces 2016 operating earnings guidance of $3.60 to $4.00 per share     

RICHMOND, Va. – Dominion Resources (NYSE: D) today announced operating earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2015, of $416 million ($0.70 per share), compared to operating earnings of $490 million ($0.84 per share) for the same period in 2014. Operating earnings are defined as reported earnings, determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), adjusted for certain items. 

Unaudited reported GAAP earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2015, were $357 million ($0.60 per share) compared with earnings of $243 million ($0.42 per share) for the same period in 2014. 

Dominion uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings guidance and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the Board of Directors, for the company's incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's fundamental earnings power. 

The principal differences between GAAP earnings and operating earnings for the quarter were charges associated with the State Corporation Commission of Virginia's final ruling associated with its biennial review of Virginia Power's base rates and charges associated with future ash pond and landfill closures. 

Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said: 

"Our fourth-quarter operating earnings were below our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.95 per share. The impact of warm temperatures accounted for at least 8 cents per share. 

"We continue to execute with strong operational and safety performance and all major projects in our infrastructure growth plan are on time and on budget. Construction on Brunswick County, the 1,358-megawatt natural gas combined-cycle facility is about 96 percent complete with all three combustion turbines successfully firing on natural gas in December. The hearing on our request for a CPCN and rate rider for the proposed 1,588-megawatt Greensville County project was held in January. The facility is expected to achieve commercial operation in late 2018. 

"In Electric Transmission we have a number of projects at various stages of regulatory approval and construction. 

"Our Cove Point liquefaction project is also progressing on time and on budget. The project overall is about 56 percent complete and engineering 97 percent complete as we are on schedule for a late 2017 in-service date. 

"We are continuing to work toward the commencement of construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and expect to execute construction contracts soon. Construction is anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter of this year. 

"In December, our Board of Directors established a 2016 dividend rate of $2.80 per share of common stock, up from $2.59 per share in 2015, or an 8.1 percent increase, subject to quarterly declaration and determination. The board also affirmed the dividend policy it set in February 2015 to pay out to shareholders approximately 70 percent to 75 percent of operating earnings. The board recently declared a first-quarter dividend of 70 cents per share of common stock." 

FOURTH-QUARTER 2015 OPERATING EARNINGS COMPARED TO 2014 

The decrease in fourth-quarter 2015 operating earnings per share as compared to fourth-quarter 2014 operating earnings per share is primarily attributable to milder-than-normal weather, the absence of a farmout transaction and the impact of bonus depreciation. 

FULL-YEAR 2015 OPERATING EARNINGS COMPARED TO 2014 

Full-year operating earnings for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2015, of $2.0 billion ($3.44 per share), compared to operating earnings of $2.0 billion ($3.43 per share) for the same period in 2014. Unaudited reported GAAP earnings for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2015, were $1.9 billion ($3.20 per share) compared with earnings of $1.3 billion ($2.24 per share) for the same period in 2014. 

The increase in full-year 2015 operating earnings per share as compared to full-year 2014 operating earnings per share is primarily attributable to growth in our regulated electric and gas business, earnings from farmouts and lower interest expense. Negative factors for the year include the absence of an asset drop into our Blue Racer joint venture, higher depreciation and effective tax rate. 

The principal differences between GAAP earnings and operating earnings for the year were charges associated with Virginia legislation enacted in February that required the write-off of Virginia Power prior-period deferred fuel costs and charges associated with future ash pond and landfill closures. 

Business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in 2015 and 2014 reported earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 of this release. 

Details of fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 operating earnings as compared to 2014 may be found on Schedule 4 of this release. 

2016 OPERATING EARNINGS GUIDANCE 

Dominion expects 2016 operating earnings in the range of $3.60 to $4.00 per share.  Positive drivers as compared to 2015 are an increase in revenues from our growth projects, lower capacity expenses, higher capacity performance revenues and investment tax credits from our solar facilities. Offsetting factors include higher depreciation, interest costs and share dilution. First-quarter 2016 operating earnings are expected to be in the range of 90 cents per share to $1.05 per share. 

In providing its 2016 operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. At this time, Dominion management is not able to estimate the aggregate impact of these items on reported earnings.
