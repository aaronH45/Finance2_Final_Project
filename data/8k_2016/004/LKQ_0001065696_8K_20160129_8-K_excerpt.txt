Item 1.01Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 

On January 29, 2016, LKQ Corporation ("LKQ" or the "Company"), LKQ Delaware LLP, and certain other subsidiaries of LKQ (collectively, the "Borrowers") entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement (the “Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) with the several lenders from time to time party thereto; Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent; Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent; The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, LTD. ("BTMU") and Citizens Bank, N.A., as documentation agents; and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, BTMU, and Citizens Bank, N.A., as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers. The Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amends the Company’s third amended and restated credit agreement dated March 27, 2014 (the “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) by modifying certain terms to (1) extend the maturity date by approximately two years to January 29, 2021; (2) increase the total availability under the credit agreement from $2.3 billion to $3.2 billion (composed of $2.45 billion in the revolving credit facility's multicurrency component; and $750 million of term loans, which consist of a term loan of approximately $500 million and a €230 million term loan); (3) increase the ability of LKQ and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness; and (4) make other immaterial or clarifying modifications and amendments to the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Borrowings will continue to bear interest at variable rates, and the applicable margins in the pricing grid remain unchanged.

Amounts under the revolving credit facility are due and payable upon maturity of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement on January 29, 2021. Amounts under the initial and additional term loan borrowings, which total $750 million as of the amendment date, will be due and payable in quarterly installments equal to 0.625% of the original principal amount on each of June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2016, and quarterly installments thereafter equal to 1.25% of the original principal amount beginning on March 31, 2017, with the remaining balance due and payable on the maturity date of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The additional term loan borrowing was approximately $340 million and was used to repay outstanding revolver borrowings and the amount outstanding under our receivables securitization facility, and to pay fees and expenses relating to the amendment and restatement. The remaining additional term loan borrowing will be used for general corporate purposes.

This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment and Restatement Agreement that is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference. 

A copy of the press release issued by LKQ related to the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
