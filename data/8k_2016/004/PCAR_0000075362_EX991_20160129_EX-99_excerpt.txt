PACCAR Achieves Record Annual Revenues and Profits  

Strong North American and European Truck Markets Drive Outstanding Results  

January 29, 2016, Bellevue, Washington – “PACCAR reported record annual revenues of $19.12 billion and record net income of $1.60 billion, an 8.4% after-tax return on revenues, for 2015. PACCAR achieved its 77th consecutive year of net income,” said Ron Armstrong, chief executive officer. “PACCAR’s financial results reflect the company’s premium-quality products and services and increased North American and European truck deliveries, complemented by excellent aftermarket parts and PACCAR Financial Services results. We are pleased to achieve record annual revenues and record net income in our milestone 110th year. I am very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered outstanding performance to our shareholders and customers.”  

PACCAR’s North American and European customers are benefiting from good economic growth, strong freight tonnage, lower fuel prices and the superior operating efficiency of Kenworth’s, Peterbilt’s and DAF’s industry-leading trucks. U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck industry retail sales in 2015 of 278,000 vehicles were the highest since 2006. Europe above 16-tonne registrations in 2015 of 269,000 vehicles were the highest since 2008.  

PACCAR’s excellent profits and strong cash flow have enabled the company to invest in future growth in its core markets while expanding its presence in emerging markets. “PACCAR is well-positioned for long-term growth with investments in new state-of-the-art DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt vehicles, innovative PACCAR engines, geographic expansion, aftermarket parts and service capabilities, factory enhancements, and truck technologies that increase fuel-efficiency and reliability,” added Armstrong. “Stockholders’ equity was a year-end record $6.94 billion at December 31, 2015.”  

Record Revenues and Net Income  

PACCAR achieved record revenues of $19.12 billion in 2015 compared to revenues of $18.99 billion in 2014. PACCAR reported record net income of $1.60 billion ($4.51 per diluted share) in 2015, an increase of 18 percent compared to $1.36 billion ($3.82 per diluted share) earned last year. Fourth quarter 2015 net sales and financial service revenues were $4.36 billion compared to $5.12 billion for the same period in 2014. PACCAR earned $347.2 million ($.98 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $394.3 million ($1.11 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2014, which reflects lower truck deliveries in North America, partially offset by increased deliveries in Europe.  

Increased Dividends and Stock Repurchases  

PACCAR declared cash dividends of $2.32 per share during 2015, including a special dividend of $1.40 per share. Total dividends were the highest in company history. The regular quarterly dividend was increased by 9 percent in September 2015. Total dividends  

 per share increased by 25 percent compared to the prior year. PACCAR’s 2015 total dividends provide a yield of over 4 percent, which is in the top 100 companies in the S&P500. PACCAR has paid a dividend every year since 1941.  

PACCAR repurchased 3.85 million of its common shares for $201.6 million in 2015. Under the current Board of Directors resolution authorizing $300 million of stock repurchases, PACCAR has repurchased 2.72 million shares for $136.3 million. “PACCAR’s excellent net profits and strong cash flow make the company’s shares an attractive long-term investment. The stock repurchase program reflects the Board’s confidence in PACCAR’s successful global business growth,” said Bob Christensen, PACCAR president and chief financial officer.

European Commission Update  

DAF is cooperating with the European Commission and is preparing its response to the Statement of Objections issued in November 2014. The Statement expressed the Commission’s preliminary view that all major European medium- and heavy-duty truck manufacturers had participated in anticompetitive practices in the European Union. The Commission indicated that it will seek to impose significant fines on the manufacturers. The Commission will review the manufacturers’ responses before issuing a decision. Any decision would be subject to appeal. The company is unable to estimate the potential fine at this time.
