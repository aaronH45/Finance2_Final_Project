 Global corporate finance revenue was $246.1 million, down 7% from the prior year period, or down 4% on a constant currency basis.

US corporate finance revenue increased 1%, while non-US revenue decreased 20%.  

 Global structured finance revenue totaled $114.1 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but flat on a constant currency basis.

US structured finance revenue was down 3% and non-US revenue was down 5%.  

 Global financial institutions revenue was $91.9 million, up 8% from the prior year period, or up 13% on a constant currency basis. This result was driven primarily by the US insurance and European banking sectors. US financial institutions revenue was up 7% and non-US revenue was up 8%.  

 Global public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was $85.2 million, down 5% versus the prior year period, or down 2% on a constant currency basis, primarily as a result of decreased US public finance activity.

 MA Fourth Quarter Revenue Up 3%  

 Global revenue for Moody’s Analytics (MA) for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $321.3 million, up 3% from the fourth quarter of 2014, or up 6% on a constant currency basis. MA’s US revenue was $142.9 million, up 6%. Non-US revenue was $178.4 million, up 1% or up 6% on a constant currency basis.  

 Global revenue from research, data and analytics (RD&A) was $161.4 million, up 8% from the prior year period, or up 11% on a constant currency basis. Growth was mainly due to strong new sales and product upgrades, coupled with record customer retention. US RD&A revenue was up 10%, while non-US revenue was up 5%.  

 Global enterprise risk solutions (ERS) generated record revenue of $121.5 million, up 1% from the prior year period, or up 4% on a constant currency basis. Growth was driven by strength in the credit assessment and originations and stress testing businesses. US and non-US ERS revenue were each up 1%.  

 Global revenue from professional services of $38.4 million was down 10% from the prior year period, or down 6% on a constant currency basis. This result was primarily due to lower net new business at Copal Amba as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on the credentials and licensing business. US professional services revenue was down 7%, while non-US revenue was down 11%.

 ASSUMPTIONS AND OUTLOOK FOR FULL YEAR 2016  

 Moody’s outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to some degree of uncertainty, and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Moody’s guidance assumes foreign currency translation for the British pound (£) of $1.42 to £1 and for the euro (€) of $1.09 to €1. For all other currencies, Moody’s assumes end-of-2015 exchange rates.  

 MCO Full Year 2016 Outlook  

 Moody’s expects full year 2016 revenue and operating expense to each grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. Moody’s projects an operating margin of approximately 42% and an adjusted operating margin of approximately 45%. The effective tax rate is expected to be 32% to 32.5%.  

 The Company expects 2016 EPS of $4.75 to $4.85.  

 Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion. Moody’s expects share repurchases to be approximately $1 billion, subject to available cash, market conditions and other capital allocation decisions.

Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $130 million.

 Corporate finance revenue is expected to be flat. Structured finance revenue and public, project and infrastructure finance revenue are each expected to grow in the high-single-digit percent range. Financial institutions revenue is expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range.  

 MA Full Year 2016 Outlook

 Professional services revenue is expected to decline in the low-single-digit percent range. Lower net new business at Copal Amba in 2015 as well as ongoing foreign exchange headwinds in the credentials and licensing business are expected to continue to impact revenue in 2016.

 Table 6 - Transaction and Relationship Revenue:    

  The tables below summarize the split between transaction and relationship revenue. In the MIS segment, excluding MIS Other, transaction revenue represents the initial rating of a new debt issuance as well as other one-time fees while relationship revenue represents the recurring monitoring of a rated debt obligation and/or entities that issue such obligations, as well as revenue from programs such as commercial paper, medium-term notes, shelf registrations and other non-rating subscription based revenue. In MIS Other, transaction revenue represents revenue from professional services and outsourcing engagements and relationship revenue represents subscription based revenues. In the MA segment, relationship revenue represents subscription-based revenues and software maintenance revenue. Transaction revenue in MA represents software license fees and revenue from risk management advisory projects, training and certification services, and outsourced research and analytical engagements.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures:    

  The tables below reflect certain adjusted results that the SEC defines as "non-GAAP financial measures" as well as a reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that such non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company's reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the Company's performance, facilitate comparisons to competitors' operating results and to provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by the Company, are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other GAAP measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the Company.   

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Table 8 - Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin:    

  The table below reflects a reconciliation of the Company’s operating income and operating margin to adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. The Company defines adjusted operating income as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization. The Company presents adjusted operating income because management deems this metric to be a useful measure of assessing the operating performance of Moody’s, measuring the Company's ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand its business. Adjusted operating income excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. Management believes that the exclusion of this item, detailed in the reconciliation below, allows for a more meaningful comparison of the Company’s results from period to period and across companies. The Company defines adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by revenue.   

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Table 9 – Free Cash Flow    

  The table below reflects a reconciliation of the Company’s net cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus payments for capital additions. Management believes that free cash flow is a useful metric in assessing the Company’s cash flows to service debt, pay dividends and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases. Management deems capital expenditures essential to the Company’s product and service innovations and maintenance of Moody’s operational capabilities. Accordingly, capital expenditures are deemed to be a recurring use of Moody’s cash flow.   

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Table 10 - Constant Currency Measures:    

  The Company presents revenue and operating income growth on a constant currency basis because management deems this metric to be a useful measure of assessing the operations of the Company in times of foreign exchange rate volatility. Constant currency measures exclude the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on operating results. The Company calculates the dollar impact of foreign exchange as the difference between the translation of its current period non-USD functional currency results using prior comparative period weighted average foreign exchange translation rates and current year as reported results. Growth rates on a constant currency basis are determined based on the difference between current period revenue and operating income translated using prior period comparative weighted average exchange rates and prior period as reported results divided by prior as reported results. Below is a reconciliation of the Company’s as reported revenue and operating income changes to the changes on a constant currency basis:

 Table 11 - 2016 Outlook    

  Moody’s outlook for 2016 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to some degree of uncertainty, and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook. Moody’s guidance, which is presented in the table below, assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates with the exception of the British pound (£) and the euro (€) which assume foreign currency translation of $1.42 to £1 and $1.09 to €1, respectively.
