*Throughout this press release, core organic sales growth refers to reported sales growth less the impacts from foreign currency translation, M&A and raw materials pass-through pricing in the Resins & Chemicals business of PMT. The raw materials pricing impact is excluded in instances where raw materials costs are passed through to customers, which drives fluctuations in selling prices not tied to volume growth.

 “Honeywell delivered a strong fourth quarter, capping off another year of robust margin expansion, earnings growth, and cash flow,” said Honeywell Chairman and CEO Dave Cote. “We grew earnings 10% in a tough environment, representing our sixth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. Segment margins grew by 220 basis points driven by strong execution across the portfolio and our key process initiatives, including HOS Gold. Free Cash Flow for the full year increased 11% to $4.4 billion, which exceeded the high-end of our guidance range and included over 125% conversion in the fourth quarter. We committed to more than $6 billion in acquisitions in 2015 to bolster our Great Positions in Good Industries, reinvested $1.1 billion in our businesses through high-return capital expenditure projects, and returned more than $3.5 billion to our shareowners, including a 15% increase in our dividend. We also funded more than $160 million in new restructuring projects, including $60 million in the fourth quarter, which will put us in an even stronger position for the future.”  

“We are planning conservatively in 2016 as we are expecting another year of slow global economic growth,” continued Cote. “But, we remain confident in Honeywell’s ability to outperform. We will support growth where there are opportunities to drive outperformance, be cautious in our sales planning, plan costs and spending conservatively, and continue to support the seed planting for new products, services, geographies, and process improvements that allow us to perform well now and in the future. We expect continued margin expansion and earnings outperformance in 2016 and over the long term, supported by our balanced portfolio, HOS Gold breakthrough goals, further penetration of High Growth Regions, and funded restructuring projects.” 

The company also reaffirms its full-year 2016 guidance.

Full-year and fourth quarter 2015 results by business segment are provided below. 

Segment Performance 

Aerospace  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ·Sales for the fourth quarter were up 2% on a core organic basis, and were up 4% reported driven by the $184 million OEM incentives incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Commercial OE sales were up 9% on a core organic basis (45% reported) driven by strong Business and General Aviation (BGA) engine shipments and higher shipments to large Air Transport and Regional (ATR) OEMs. Commercial Aftermarket sales were up 3% on a core organic basis (2% reported) driven by continued growth in repair and overhaul activities. Defense & Space sales decreased (1%) on a core organic basis (down 3% reported) driven by lower sales to the U.S. government and a difficult prior year comparison in the international business. Transportation Systems sales were up 1% on a core organic basis driven by new platform launches and higher diesel and gas turbo penetration on passenger vehicles, partially offset by lower commercial vehicle production. TS sales were down (10%) reported due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. 

 ·Segment profit for the fourth quarter was up 29% and segment margins expanded 420 bps to 21.5%, driven by the fourth quarter 2014 OEM incentives, productivity net of inflation, and commercial excellence, partially offset by the margin impact of higher OE shipments and continued investments for growth. Excluding the fourth quarter 2014 OEM incentives, segment profit was up 1%, and segment margins expanded 50 basis points.

 ·Sales for the fourth quarter were flat on a core organic basis and down (3%) reported driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Energy, Safety & Security (ESS) sales decreased (1%) on a core organic basis (down 3% reported) driven primarily by a difficult prior year comparison in Sensing & Productivity Solutions (S&PS), partially offset by continued growth in Security and Fire (HSF) on a global basis. Building Solutions & Distribution (BSD) sales increased 3% on a core organic basis (down 3% reported) driven by continued strength in Americas Distribution partially offset by slowing Building Solutions backlog conversion.  

 ·Segment profit for the fourth quarter was flat and segment margins expanded 70 bps to 16.6% driven by productivity net of inflation, benefits of previously funded restructuring projects, and commercial excellence, partially offset by continued investments for growth. 

Performance Materials and Technologies  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ·Sales for the fourth quarter were down (4%) on a core organic basis and down (12%) reported driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and lower raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals. The decrease in core organic sales was primarily driven by lower UOP gas processing, equipment and licensing sales, HPS field products weakness, and lower volume in Resins & Chemicals, partially offset by higher UOP catalyst shipments and higher volume in Fluorine Products.  

 ·Segment profit for the fourth quarter was up 9% and segment margins increased 380 bps to 20.3%, driven by productivity net of inflation, commercial excellence, and the favorable impact of raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals (pricing model protects profit dollars).

Reconciliation of Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow and Calculation of Free Cash Flow Conversion (Unaudited) 

(Dollars in millions) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(A) Mark-to-market uses a blended tax rate of 36.1% and 28.1% for 2015 and 2014. 

We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment. 

We define free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income, attributable to Honeywell, excluding pension mark-to-market adjustment. 

We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, and to pay dividends, repurchase stock, or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity.
