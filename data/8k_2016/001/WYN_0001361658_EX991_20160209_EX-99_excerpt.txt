FOURTH QUARTER 2015 OPERATING RESULTS 

Fourth quarter revenues were $1.3 billion, an increase of 6% from the prior year period. 

Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $273 million, compared with $252 million in the prior year period, an increase of 8%. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA comparisons were adversely affected by foreign currency effects of $8 million in 2015. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions and a divestiture, adjusted EBITDA also increased 8%. 

Adjusted net income was $113 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, compared with $112 million, or $0.90 per diluted share for the same period in 2014. Net income and earnings per share benefited from strong operating results, but were reduced by foreign currency effects and higher interest expense. EPS also benefited from the Company’s share repurchase program. 

Reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $140 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, compared with $81 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2014. Reported net income in both periods reflects several items excluded from adjusted net income. The net result of these items favorably impacted fourth quarter 2015 net income by $27 million and unfavorably impacted fourth quarter 2014 net income by $31 million. Full reconciliations of adjusted net income to GAAP results appear in Table 8 of this press release. Year-over-year fourth quarter reported net income comparisons also were negatively impacted by foreign currency effects. 

FULL YEAR 2015 OPERATING RESULTS 

Revenues for full year 2015 were $5.5 billion, an increase of 5% over the prior year period. 

Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2015 was $1,297 million, compared with $1,238 million in the prior year period. Year-over-year adjusted EBITDA comparisons were adversely affected by foreign currency effects of $46 million in 2015. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions and a divestiture, adjusted EBITDA increased 8%. 

Adjusted net income for the full year 2015 was $608 million, or $5.11 per diluted share, compared with $573 million, or $4.53 per diluted share, for the prior year. The increases reflect stronger operating results across all of the Company’s businesses, partially offset by foreign currency effects. EPS also benefited from the Company’s share repurchase program. 

Reported net income for full year 2015 was $612 million, or $5.14 per diluted share, compared with reported net income of $529 million, or $4.18 per diluted share, for the prior year period. Reported net income reflects several items excluded from adjusted net income. The net result of these items favorably impacted full year 2015 net income by $4 million and unfavorably impacted full year 2014 net income by $44 million. Full reconciliations of adjusted results to GAAP results appear in Table 8 of this press release. 

FULL YEAR 2015 CASH FLOW 

Free cash flow was $769 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $749 million for the same period in 2014. The increase reflects strong operating results and lower capital expenditures. In addition, 2015 free cash flow was unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $991 million, compared with $984 million in the prior year period. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.

Hotel Group 

Revenues were $314 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an 18% increase compared with the fourth quarter 2014.

Results reflect higher royalty and management fees and growth in our Wyndham Rewards credit card program.

Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $174 million, an increase of 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. On a currency-neutral basis and excluding the impact of the increase in the inter-segment licensing fee rate, adjusted EBITDA increased 5%, reflecting higher sales volume.

Presentation of Financial Information 

Financial information discussed in this press release includes non-GAAP measures, which include or exclude certain items. These non-GAAP measures differ from reported GAAP results and are intended to illustrate what management believes are relevant period-over-period comparisons and are helpful to investors as an additional tool for further understanding and assessing the Company’s ongoing core operating performance. Exclusion of items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be considered an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. A reconciliation of reported GAAP results to the comparable non-GAAP information appears in the financial tables section of the press release. It is not practicable to provide a reconciliation of forecasted adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items cannot be reasonably estimated or predicted at this time. Any such items could be significant to the Company’s reported results.

OPERATING RESULTS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 

(In millions) 

In addition to other measures, management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon net revenues and “EBITDA”, which is defined as net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense (excluding consumer financing interest), early extinguishment of debt, interest income (excluding consumer financing revenues) and income taxes, each of which is presented on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of performance for the Company's segments which when considered with GAAP measures, gives a more complete understanding of its operating performance. The Company’s presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. 

The following tables summarize net revenues and EBITDA for the Company's reportable segments, as well as reconcile EBITDA to Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:

 FREE CASH FLOW    

We define free cash flow to be net cash provided by operating activities less property and equipment additions which we also refer to as capital expenditures. 

We believe free cash flow to be a useful operating performance measure to evaluate the ability of our operations to generate cash for uses other than capital expenditures and, after debt service and other obligations, our ability to grow our business through acquisitions, development advances and equity investments, as well as our ability to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities as a means for evaluating Wyndham Worldwide is that free cash flow does not represent the total cash movement for the period as detailed in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 

The following table provides more details on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measure and the related reconciliation between these financial measures:
