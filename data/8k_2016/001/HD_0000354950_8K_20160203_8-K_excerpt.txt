On February 3, 2016, The Home Depot, Inc.

Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (together, the “Underwriters”). The Underwriting Agreement relates to a public offering by the Company of $1,350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.000% Senior Notes due April 1, 2021 (the “2021 Notes”), $1,300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.000% Senior Notes due April 1, 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due April 1, 2046 (the “2046 Notes” and, together with the 2021 Notes and the 2026 Notes, the “Notes”). The offering of the Notes was made pursuant to the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-206550) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 25, 2015.

The Company previously issued $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due April 1, 2046 (the “Existing 2046 Notes”) on June 2, 2015, all of which will remain outstanding following the closing of the offering of the Notes. The 2046 Notes will form a single series with the Existing 2046 Notes and will have the same terms as the Existing 2046 Notes. The 2046 Notes will have the same CUSIP number as the Existing 2046 Notes and will trade interchangeably with the Existing 2046 Notes immediately upon settlement. Upon issuance of the 2046 Notes, the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Company’s 4.250% Senior Notes due April 1, 2046 will be $1,600,000,000.

Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company agreed to sell the Notes to the Underwriters, and the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Notes for resale to the public. The Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company. It also provides for customary indemnification by each of the Company and the Underwriters against certain liabilities and customary contribution provisions in respect of those liabilities.

The Company expects the offering of the Notes to close on February 12, 2016, subject to customary closing conditions.
