30 1) During the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded net restructuring and special items of $26.4 million. The charges included $24.4 million in severance and other personnel costs along with $2.3 million in facility-related costs associated with facility closures and general integration initiatives.

In addition, the Company recorded a non-cash loss of $2.3 million, upon the dissolution of one of its equity investments (recorded in other, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations). The after tax impact of these charges decreased net earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, by $27.7 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.27 ($27.7 million divided by 102.9 million shares). During the first two quarters of 2015, the Company recorded net restructuring and other special charges of $33.5 million. The charges included $9.5 million in severance and other personnel costs along with $9.8 million in costs associated with facility closures and general integration initiatives. The Company reversed previously established reserves of $0.6 million in unused facility-related costs. In addition, the Company recorded asset impairments of $14.8 million relating to lab and customer service applications that will no longer be used.

The costs included $79.5 million of Covance employee equity awards, change in control payments and short-term retention arrangements that were accelerated or triggered by the acquisition transaction (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations). The acquisition costs also included advisor and legal fees of $33.9 million (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations), $15.2 million of deferred financing fees associated with the Company’s bridge loan facility as well as a make-whole payment of $37.4 million paid to call Covance’s private placement debt outstanding at the purchase date (both amounts recorded in interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations). The after tax impact of these charges decreased net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, by $182.5 million and diluted earnings per share by $1.83 ($182.5 million divided by 99.7 million shares).

The Company reversed previously established reserves of $0.2 in unused severance and $0.2 million in unused facility-related costs. In addition, the Company recorded $5.5 million in consulting expenses relating to fees incurred as part of its comprehensive enterprise-wide cost structure review as well as legal fees associated with its LipoScience acquisition (all such fees recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses).

During the first two quarters of 2014, the Company recorded net restructuring and special items of $14.3 million.

The Company believes adjusting EPS for amortization provides investors with better insight into the operating performance of the business. For the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, intangible amortization was $47.1 million and $18.3 million, respectively ($32.9 million and $11.3 million net of tax, respectively) and decreased EPS by $0.31 ($32.9 million divided by 102.9 million shares) and $0.13 ($11.3 million divided by 86.5 million shares), respectively.

These payments were comprised of $75.5 million in legal and advisor fees, $40.6 million in accelerated Covance employee equity awards, and $37.4 million in make- whole payments triggered by calling Covance private placement notes outstanding at the time of the transaction.
