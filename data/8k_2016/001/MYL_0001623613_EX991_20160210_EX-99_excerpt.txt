Financial Highlights 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Full year adjusted free cash flow of $1.85 billion, up 107% [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Mylan CEO Heather Bresch commented, "Our exceptional 2015 results were highlighted by year-over-year constant currency adjusted total revenues growth of 28% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 21%. This strong performance is again a testament to the strength and diversity of our global platform and our unwavering focus on execution. In addition to our solid financial performance, with growth across all of our segments and regions, we also closed and integrated two key acquisitions in 2015, the EPD Business and certain female healthcare businesses from Famy Care Limited, all while continuing to make meaningful progress against our strategic growth drivers. For instance, we submitted our Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for generic Advair® to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and we advanced many of our Biocon-partnered biosimilars/insulin programs, as well as recently announced our worldwide collaboration with Momenta to jointly develop and commercialize up to six biosimilar products, positioning us as a worldwide leader in this exciting area.

"We are off to a great start in 2016. We anticipate year-over-year total revenues growing 16% and adjusted diluted EPS growing 16%, and we are excited about our announcement today of our offer to acquire Meda. We have assumed the closing of Meda by the end of the third quarter, and we have incorporated one quarter of Meda in our 2016 guidance. However, we are committed to our 2016 guidance ranges with or without Meda. Looking ahead, the Meda transaction creates the opportunity to accelerate achievement of our $6.00 adjusted diluted EPS target to 2017 versus 2018(1)."

(1) Stated 2017 opportunity/2018 target; this is a long-term target only and does not represent company guidance.

Mylan CFO John Sheehan added, "Mylan's exceptional 2015 results reflect strong growth in our legacy business, enhanced by the addition of the EPD Business, demonstrating our ability to drive organic growth as well as execute on value-enhancing transactions. We also had a record year with respect to cash, as our adjusted free cash flow in 2015 grew an outstanding 107% to $1.85 billion. As we enter 2016, we have the most financial flexibility that we have ever had in our history. With full access to our balance sheet cash in excess of $1.2 billion, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA of less than 2.0 times at year end, we have the opportunity to continue to invest for growth, both organically and inorganically."

Fourth Quarter 2015 Financial Results

Generics Segment Revenues

Generics segment third party net sales were $2.22 billion for the quarter, an increase of 22% when compared to the prior year period. When translating adjusted third party net sales for the current quarter at prior year comparative period exchange rates ("constant currency"), adjusted third party net sales increased by 27%.

Specialty Segment Revenues

Specialty segment reported third party net sales were $254.1 million for the quarter, an increase of 5% when compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to higher net sales of the EpiPen® Auto-Injector due to higher volumes, but with the same net payor pricing dynamics that existed throughout 2015.

Total Gross Profit

Adjusted gross profit was $1.40 billion and adjusted gross margins were 56% for the quarter as compared to adjusted gross profit of $1.12 billion and adjusted gross margins of 54% in the comparable prior year period. The current quarter increase was primarily due to net sales from the acquired EPD Business and new product introductions, partially offset by pricing reductions. GAAP gross profit was $1.06 billion and $969.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2014, respectively. GAAP gross margins were 43% and 47% in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Total Profitability

Adjusted earnings from operations for the quarter were $746.6 million, up 23% from the comparable prior year period. GAAP earnings from operations were $423.9 million for the quarter, an increase of 8% from the comparable prior year period. GAAP R&D expense and GAAP SG&A expense increased due to the impact of the acquired EPD Business. 

EBITDA, which is defined as net earnings (excluding the non-controlling interest and losses from equity method investees) plus income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, was $657.5 million for the quarter and $548.8 million for the comparable prior year quarter. After adjusting for certain items as further detailed in the reconciliation below, adjusted EBITDA was $827.2 million for the quarter and $682.1 million for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Mylan N.V. increased by $200.4 million to $620.2 million compared to $419.8 million for the prior year comparable period. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 16% to $1.22 compared to $1.05 in the prior year comparable period. Note that GAAP requires EPS to be calculated for each individual period based on the average shares outstanding for the period, both on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis. Given the issuance of shares to Abbott Laboratories in the first quarter of 2015, there is an impact to Mylan's average fourth quarter outstanding shares as compared to Mylan's average full year outstanding shares. See "Impact of Shares Issued in EPD Transaction" chart in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for further details. GAAP net earnings attributable to Mylan N.V. increased by $5.4 million to $194.6 million as compared to $189.2 million for the prior year comparable period. GAAP diluted EPS decreased from $0.47 to $0.38 when compared to the prior year comparable period due to the impact of ordinary shares issued in the current year for the acquisition of the EPD Business.

Full Year 2015 Financial Results

Generics Segment Revenues

Generics segment adjusted third party net sales were $8.17 billion for the year, an increase of 27% when compared to the prior year. GAAP Generics segment third party net sales were $8.16 billion. Constant currency adjusted third party net sales increased by 33%.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Specialty Segment Revenues

Specialty segment reported third party net sales of $1.20 billion for the year, an increase of 1% when compared to the prior year. This increase was partially due to higher volumes of the EpiPen® Auto-Injector, which was offset by lower pricing. The EpiPen® Auto-Injector is the number one dispensed epinephrine auto-injector and as a global franchise reached $1 billion in annual net sales for the second year in a row. In addition, sales of the Perforomist® Inhalation Solution and ULTIVA® increased by double digit percentage points from the prior year.

Total Gross Profit

Adjusted gross profit was $5.25 billion and adjusted gross margins were 56% for the year as compared to adjusted gross profit of $4.05 billion and adjusted gross margins of 52% in the comparable prior year. The current year increase was primarily due to net sales from the acquired EPD Business, new product introductions and increased margins on existing products in North America. GAAP gross profit was $4.22 billion and $3.53 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. GAAP gross margins were 45% and 46% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Total Profitability

Adjusted earnings from operations for the year were $2.70 billion, up 30% from the comparable prior year. GAAP earnings from operations were $1.46 billion for the year, an increase of 8% from the comparable prior year. GAAP R&D expense increased primarily due to the impact of the acquired EPD Business. In addition, R&D increased due to the continued development of our respiratory, insulin and biologics programs as well as the timing of internal and external product development projects. GAAP SG&A expense increased from the prior year as a result of the impact of the acquired EPD Business and higher acquisition and integration related costs. 

EBITDA was $2.39 billion for the year and $1.97 billion for the comparable prior year. After adjusting for certain items as further detailed in the reconciliation below, adjusted EBITDA was $3.01 billion for the year and $2.37 billion for the comparable prior year. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Mylan N.V. increased by $721.1 million to $2.14 billion compared to $1.42 billion for the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 21% to $4.30 compared to $3.56 in the comparable prior year. Note that GAAP requires EPS to be calculated for each individual period based on the average shares outstanding for the period, both on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis. Given the issuance of shares to Abbott Laboratories in the first quarter of 2015, there is an impact to Mylan's average fourth quarter outstanding shares as compared to Mylan's average full year outstanding shares. When aggregated, adjusted diluted EPS for the four quarters of 2015 do not equal the full year adjusted diluted EPS figure. GAAP net earnings attributable to Mylan N.V. decreased by $81.8 million to $847.6 million as compared to $929.4 million for the prior year. This decrease is primarily due to increased amortization expense and transaction costs incurred in the current year. In the prior year we recorded a gain related to the resolution of contingent consideration related to the Agila transaction and tax benefits related to the merger of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries, Agila Specialties Private Limited and Onco Therapies Limited, into Mylan Laboratories Limited. GAAP diluted EPS decreased from $2.34 to $1.70 when compared to the prior year.

Cash Flow 

Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was $602 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 compared to $181 million for the comparable prior year period. On a GAAP basis, net cash provided by operating activities was $651 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 compared to $127 million for the comparable prior year period. Capital expenditures were approximately $156 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to approximately $105 million for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted free cash flow was $446 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 compared to $76 million in the prior year period.

Adjusted cash provided by operating activities was $2.22 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.21 billion for the comparable prior year. On a GAAP basis, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $1.01 billion for the comparable prior year. The increase in GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter and year to date period was primarily due to an increase in earnings, excluding non-cash items, combined with our ongoing working capital initiatives. Capital expenditures were approximately $363 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to approximately $325 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Adjusted free cash flow was $1.85 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $894 million in the prior year. 

Guidance

Mylan expects 2016 total revenues, with or without Meda, in the range of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, the midpoint of which represents an increase of 16% versus 2015. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.85 to $5.15, with or without Meda, the midpoint of which represents an increase of 16% versus 2015.

Annual General Meeting of Shareholders

Mylan will host its annual general meeting of shareholders on Friday, June 24, 2016 (the "AGM"). If a shareholder wishes to submit a proposal pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, such proposal must be delivered to and received by Mylan at its principal executive offices (Building 4, Trident Place Mosquito Way, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, AL10 9UL, United Kingdom) to the attention of our Corporate Secretary, no later than March 2, 2016, and the shareholder must otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 and Dutch law in order for the proposal to be considered for inclusion in the 2016 proxy statement and proxy. Any other shareholder proposal for an agenda item pursuant to section 7.06 of Mylan’s articles of association and section 2:114a of the Dutch Civil Code must be submitted no later than April 25, 2016 and otherwise comply with Mylan's articles of association.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This press release includes the presentation and discussion of certain financial information that differs from what is reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted cash provided by operating activities, adjusted third party net sales from Europe, Generics segment adjusted third party net sales, adjusted third party net sales, adjusted total revenues, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margins, adjusted earnings from operations, adjusted net earnings attributable to Mylan N.V. ("Mylan" or the "Company"), constant currency total revenues, constant currency third party net sales, constant currency adjusted total revenues, constant currency adjusted third party net sales, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, net debt to adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted free cash flow, are presented in order to supplement investors' and other readers' understanding and assessment of the Company's financial performance. Management uses these measures internally for forecasting, budgeting and measuring its operating performance. In addition, primarily due to acquisitions, Mylan believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company believes that including EBITDA and supplemental adjustments applied in presenting adjusted EBITDA pursuant to our debt agreements is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate the Company's ability to comply with financial debt covenants (which are calculated using a measure similar to adjusted EBITDA) and assess the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness. We also report sales performance using the non-GAAP financial measure of "constant currency" total revenues, adjusted total revenues, third party net sales, and adjusted third party net sales. This measure provides information on the change in net sales assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current period. The comparisons presented as constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. We routinely evaluate our third party net sales performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating a period-to-period comparison of our operational activities, and we believe that this presentation also provides useful information to investors for the same reason. The "Summary of Adjusted Revenues by Segment" table below compares third party net sales and, as applicable, adjusted third party net sales on an actual and constant currency basis for each reportable segment and the geographic regions within the Generics segment for the three months ended and year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Also, set forth below, Mylan has provided reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures set forth below, and investors and other readers should consider non-GAAP measures only as supplements to, not as substitutes for or as superior measures to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Below is a reconciliation of GAAP net earnings attributable to Mylan N.V. and GAAP diluted EPS to adjusted net earnings attributable to Mylan N.V. and adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the respective prior year period (in millions, except per share amounts):

Impact of Shares Issued in EPD Transaction

GAAP requires that EPS be calculated for each individual period based on average shares outstanding for the period (both quarter-to-date and year-to-date). The issuance of shares to Abbott in the first quarter of 2015 impacted the average quarterly outstanding shares versus average outstanding shares for the full year of 2015.

(c)Adjusted diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2010, includes the full effect of the conversion of the company's preferred stock into 125.2 million shares of common stock on November 15, 2010. Adjusted diluted EPS for the period ended December 31, 2009 was calculated under the "if-converted method" which assumes conversion of the Company's preferred stock into shares of common stock, based on an average share price, and excludes the preferred dividend from the calculation, as the "if-converted method" is more dilutive.

Reconciliation of Forecasted Guidance

The reconciliations below are based on management's estimate of adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ending December 31, 2016. Mylan expects certain known GAAP amounts for 2016, as presented in the reconciliation below. Other GAAP charges, including those related to potential litigation, asset impairments and restructuring programs that would be excluded from the adjusted results are possible, but their amounts are dependent on numerous factors that we currently cannot ascertain with sufficient certainty or are presently unknown. These GAAP charges are dependent upon future events and valuations that have not yet occurred or been performed. The unaudited forecasted amounts presented below are stated in millions, except for earnings per share data.

The Company's annual budgeting process, which is the basis for its 2016 earnings guidance, is performed on an adjusted basis. That process is then supplemented by adjusting net income for known differences between the Company's budgeted adjusted net income and GAAP net income, without application of such differences to specific U.S. GAAP income statement line items. As such, the Company has not reconciled its 2016 earnings guidance for adjusted gross margin, adjusted R&D, adjusted SG&A and the adjusted effective tax rate to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because the comparable GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis is not accessible and cannot be estimated without unreasonable effort.
