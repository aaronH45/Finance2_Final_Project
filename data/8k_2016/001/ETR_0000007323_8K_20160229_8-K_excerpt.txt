Item 8.01. Other Events.

As previously disclosed, in December 2014, Entergy Arkansas, Inc. (“Entergy Arkansas”), Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. (“Entergy Gulf States Louisiana”) and Entergy Texas, Inc. (“Entergy Texas”) entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the Union Power Station from Union Power Partners, L.P. The Union Power Station is a 1,980 MW (summer rating) power generation facility located near El Dorado, Arkansas that consists of four natural gas-fired, combined-cycle turbine power blocks, each rated at 495 MW (summer rating). Entergy Arkansas was obligated to purchase one power block and a 25% undivided ownership interest in certain assets related to the facility. Entergy New Orleans, Inc. succeeded to the obligation of Entergy Texas to acquire one power block and a 25% undivided ownership interest in certain assets related to the facility. As a result of the business combination of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, LLC (“Entergy Louisiana”) in October 2015, Entergy Louisiana succeeded to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s obligation to purchase two power blocks and a 50% undivided ownership interest in certain assets relating to the facility.

The final regulatory approval needed to complete the transaction was received from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on February 29, 2016. Closing of the purchase is expected to be completed as promptly as practicable, subject to satisfaction or waiver of the remaining conditions to closing.
