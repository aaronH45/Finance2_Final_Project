SCANA Reports Financial Results for Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015, Reaffirms 2016 Guidance, and Issues Long-term Guidance

Cayce, S.C., February 18, 2016... SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) today announced earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, SCANA reported earnings of $746 million, or $5.22 per share, compared to earnings of $538 million, or $3.79 per share, for the same period in 2014. Year to date 2015 earnings include a $201 million, net of tax gain or $1.41 per share, from the sale of two subsidiaries, Carolina Gas Transmission (CGT) and SCANA Communications, Inc. (SCI). 

“2015 was certainly an eventful year,” said Jimmy Addison, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “We sold two subsidiaries during the first quarter of the year, experienced a thousand year flood in parts of our SCE&G service territory, had a change in the structure of the New Nuclear construction team, and again experienced a positive electric margin impact from weather in both the winter and summer seasons, with abnormal weather contributing 8 cents per share to electric margins.”

SCANA’s earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $98 million, or 69 cents per share, compared to earnings of $105 million, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 2014. 

FINANCIAL RESULTS BY MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS 

South Carolina Electric & Gas Company

Reported earnings for 2015 at South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANA’s principal subsidiary, were $480 million, or $3.35 per share, compared to $458 million, or $3.23 per share, in 2014. Electric margins were higher due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth. The adoption of new depreciation rates for electric and common utility property following the completion of a customary depreciation study and its subsequent approval by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina also contributed to increased earnings for the year. These items were offset by a lower weather contribution to electric margins and increases in expenses related to our capital program including interest expense, property taxes, and share dilution. For the full year 2015, abnormal weather (compared to historical average) increased earnings by 8 cents per share, compared to 21 cents per share for the full year 2014. For the fourth quarter of 2015, SCE&G reported earnings of $75 million, or 52 cents per share, compared to $75 million, or 53 cents per share, in the same quarter of 2014. Abnormal weather decreased earnings by 14 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to a decrease of 2 cents per share in the same quarter of 2014. At year-end 2015, SCE&G

was serving approximately 698,000 electric customers and 347,000 natural gas customers, up 1.5 and 2.7 percent, respectively, over 2014.

PSNC Energy

PSNC Energy, the Company’s North Carolina-based retail natural gas distribution subsidiary, reported 2015 earnings of $54 million, or 38 cents per share, compared to $55 million, or 39 cents per share, in 2014. The decrease is primarily attributable to increased O&M and depreciation expenses. Reported earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $24 million, or 17 cents per share, compared to $23 million, or 16 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. At year-end 2015, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 534,000 customers, an increase of 2.5 percent over the previous year.

SCANA Energy - Georgia 

SCANA Energy, the Company’s retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported 2015 earnings of $19 million, or 13 cents per share, compared to $26 million, or 18 cents per share, in 2014. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $1 million, or 1 cent per share, compared to $10 million, or 7 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. These decreases are primarily attributable to lower throughput due to warmer than normal weather during the fourth quarter of 2015.

Corporate and Other, Net 

SCANA’s corporate and other businesses, which include SCANA Energy Marketing, the holding company, and prior to their sales, CGT and SCI, reported earnings of $194 million, or $1.36 per share in 2015, compared to a loss of $1 million, or 1 cent per share in 2014. This increase is mainly attributable to gains on the sales of CGT and SCI during the first quarter of 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2015, these businesses reported a loss of $2 million, or 1 cent per share, compared to a loss of $3 million, or 3 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. This change is primarily attributable to lower interest expense at the holding company, partially offset by the forgone earnings contributions from the subsidiaries that were sold during the first quarter of 2015.

EARNINGS OUTLOOK

The Company reaffirms its guidance for 2016 GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings per share of $3.90 to $4.10, with an internal target of $4.00 per share. 

The Company is increasing the lower end of the band of its average annual growth rate target for GAAP-Adjusted Weather Normalized earnings per share from 3 percent to 4 percent. The new guidance is 4 to 6 percent over the next 3 to 5 years. The Company is also resetting its base year to 2015 GAAP-Adjusted Weather Normalized earnings per share of $3.73 (reflecting a downward adjustment of 8 cents per share to normalize weather in the electric business and $1.41 per share to remove the gains on the sales of CGT and SCI). 

In addition to the guidance information above, which is provided using a GAAP-Adjusted Weather Normalized basis, the following information is provided in accordance with SEC Regulation G. Based on 2015 GAAP earnings per share of $5.22, the Company’s targeted average annual earnings per share growth rate is negative 6 to 0 percent over the next 3 to 5 years due to the impact of the gains on the sales of the subsidiaries and incremental electric margins due to favorable weather in 2015.

The Company's management believes that these non-GAAP earnings and earnings growth measures provide a meaningful representation of the Company's fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period-over-period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data. In management's opinion, these non-GAAP measures serve as useful indicators of the financial results of the Company's primary businesses and as a basis for management's provision of earnings guidance and growth projections. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures in making resource allocation and other budgetary and operational decisions. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the GAAP measures of earnings per share or average annual earnings per share growth rate, but are offered as supplements to those GAAP measures.

Factors and risks that could impact future earnings are discussed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and below under the Safe Harbor Statement.

Note (1): Pursuant to an Order of the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (SCPSC) related to SCE&G’s demand side management program, SCE&G’s electric revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 was adjusted downward $4 million. Under that Order, the Company concurrently recognized, within other income, $4 million of gains realized upon the late 2013 settlement of certain interest rate derivative contracts which were previously recorded as regulatory liabilities. Also pursuant to Orders of the SCPSC, for the year ended December 31, 2014, SCE&G’s electric revenues were adjusted downward $69 million, $46 million of which is related to fuel cost recovery and $23 million of which relates to SCE&G’s demand side management program. Under those Orders the Company concurrently recognized, within other income, $64 million of gains realized upon the late 2013 settlement of certain interest rate derivative contracts which were previously recorded as regulatory liabilities, and applied, as an offset to operation and maintenance expense, $5 million of its storm damage reserve, also previously recorded as a regulatory liability. 

Note (2): Pursuant to an Order of the SCPSC related to SCE&G’s demand side management program, SCE&G’s electric revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects a downward adjustment of $5 million.

Note (3): During the third quarter of 2015, the SCPSC approved SCE&G’s adoption of updated, lower depreciation rates for its electric and common utility assets effective as of January 1, 2015. The SCPSC also approved SCE&G’s request that the reduction relating to the first half of 2015’s depreciation expense resulting from the adoption of these depreciation rates be offset with a corresponding reduction to recovery of fuel costs (electric revenue). As such, depreciation expense for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2015 reflects a decrease of $7 million and $29 million, respectively, and electric revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects a reduction of approximately $14.5 million. 

Note (4): In the first quarter of 2015, SCANA sold two of its subsidiaries, CGT and SCI. The sales were closed on January 31st and February 20th of 2015, respectively. The gain on the sale of CGT was $136 million, or 95 cents per share, net of taxes and the gain on the sale of SCI was $65 million, or 46 cents per share, net of taxes.
