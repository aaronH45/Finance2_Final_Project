KIMBERLY-CLARK ANNOUNCES YEAR-END 2015 RESULTS AND 2016 OUTLOOK

DALLAS, January 25, 2016-Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE: KMB) today reported year-end 2015 results and provided its 2016 outlook and related key planning assumptions.

Executive Summary

•Fourth quarter 2015 net sales of $4.5 billion decreased 6 percent compared to the year-ago period, as changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales 11 percent. Organic sales rose 5 percent, including a 9 percent increase in developing and emerging markets.

•Diluted net income per share for the fourth quarter was income of $0.91 in 2015 and a loss of $0.22 in 2014. Full-year diluted net income per share was $2.77 in 2015 and $4.04 in 2014.

•Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.42 in 2015 compared to adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.35 in 2014. Performance benefited from organic sales growth, cost savings, input cost deflation and a lower share count. Comparisons were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate effects, increased marketing, research and general spending on a local currency basis and higher other expense. Adjusted earnings per share in both years exclude certain items described later in this news release.

•Full-year adjusted earnings per share were $5.76 in 2015, up 5 percent compared to adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.51 in 2014. The company’s previous guidance was for adjusted earnings per share of $5.70 to $5.80. The company’s original outlook in January 2015 was for adjusted earnings per share of $5.60 to $5.80.

•At the end of 2015, Kimberly-Clark deconsolidated its Venezuelan business from the company’s balance sheet and moved to the cost method of accounting for its operations in Venezuela. As a result, the company recorded an after tax charge of $102 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.

•Adjusted earnings per share in 2016 are expected to be $5.95 to $6.15. The outlook reflects expectations for 3 to 5 percent organic sales growth, substantial cost savings, relatively benign commodity costs and significantly unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas J. Falk said, “Our fourth quarter results capped off another year of good financial performance for Kimberly-Clark. For the full year of 2015, we achieved 5 percent organic sales growth, highlighted by 10 percent growth in developing and emerging markets and a 5 percent volume increase in our North American consumer products business. We also improved 

-2-

adjusted operating profit margin by 120 basis points, including benefits from $365 million of FORCE cost savings. In addition, we grew adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations 5 percent, toward the high end of our original guidance for the year despite significantly more currency headwinds. Finally, we improved return on invested capital considerably and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I’m pleased with our execution in a challenging environment.” 

Falk added, “Looking to 2016, we will continue to focus on the fundamentals that create shareholder value and we expect to deliver good underlying financial performance. We will also continue to invest in our brands, our targeted growth initiatives and our capabilities. We plan to achieve healthy organic sales growth and cost savings, improve cash flow and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. Despite another year of significantly unfavorable currencies, we also expect to further improve our margins and deliver 3 to 7 percent growth in adjusted earnings per share. We are very optimistic about our future and our ability to generate attractive returns to shareholders through successful execution of our Global Business Plan.” 

Fourth Quarter 2015 Operating Results

Sales of $4.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015 were down 6 percent compared to the year-ago period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales 11 percent as a result of the weakening of most currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Organic sales rose 5 percent, as volumes increased 4 percent and net selling prices improved 1 percent.

Fourth quarter operating profit was $630 million in 2015 and $158 million in 2014. Adjusted operating profit was $779 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $769 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted results in 2015 exclude $108 million of charges for the Venezuelan deconsolidation, $27 million of 2014 Organization Restructuring costs, $8 million of charges for pension settlements and $6 million of charges for restructuring the company’s business in Turkey. Adjusted results in 2014 exclude a $462 million charge for a balance sheet remeasurement in Venezuela, $133 million of 2014 Organization Restructuring costs, $20 million of restructuring costs for European strategic changes and $4 million of income related to an updated assessment regarding a regulatory dispute in the Middle East.

The year-over-year adjusted operating profit comparison benefited from organic sales growth, $85 million in cost savings from the company’s FORCE (Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere) program and $15 million of savings from the 2014 Organization Restructuring. Input costs decreased $50 million, including $45 million of lower costs for raw materials other than fiber and $5 million of lower energy costs. Other manufacturing-related costs also decreased versus the year-ago period. Translation effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates lowered operating profit by $85 million and transaction effects also negatively impacted the comparison. Total marketing, research and general expenses increased on a local currency basis, mostly due to higher administrative and selling costs. On an adjusted basis, other (income) and expense, net was expense of $23 million in 2015 and $7 million in 2014. Results in 2015 were driven by foreign currency transaction losses, including impacts of the devaluation of the Argentine peso in December 2015.

-3-

The fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes the effects of the previously mentioned items excluded from adjusted earnings per share, was 30.6 percent in 2015 and 30.5 percent in 2014. The adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 also excludes the impact of a $49 million tax charge, related to prior years, as a result of an updated assessment of uncertain tax positions. Kimberly-Clark’s share of net income of equity companies in the fourth quarter was $37 million in 2015 and $33 million in 2014. At Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, results benefited from organic sales growth, lower input costs and cost savings, but were negatively impacted by a weaker Mexican peso. Fourth quarter net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $11 million in 2015 and $20 million in 2014. The change was driven by the redemption of $0.5 billion of preferred securities in December 2014.

Cash Flow and Balance Sheet

Cash provided by operations in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $665 million versus $590 million in 2014. Full-year cash provided by operations was $2,306 million in 2015 and $2,845 million in 2014. The comparison was negatively impacted by higher pension contributions, increased working capital and the 2014 spin-off of the health care business, partially offset by lower tax payments. Full-year defined benefit pension plan contributions were $485 million in 2015 and $185 million in 2014. 

Capital spending for the fourth quarter was $258 million in 2015 and $309 million in 2014. Full-year spending was $1,056 million in 2015 and $1,039 million in 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 share repurchases were 2.9 million shares at a cost of $350 million. Full-year 2015 share repurchases totaled 7.1 million shares at a cost of $800 million. Total debt was $7.8 billion at the end of 2015 and $7.0 billion at the end of 2014.

Adjusted operating profit comparisons benefited from organic sales growth, FORCE cost savings of $365 million, input cost deflation of $150 million and $65 million of savings from the 2014 Organization Restructuring. Translation effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates lowered operating profit by $360 million and transaction effects also negatively impacted the operating profit comparisons.

Diluted net income per share was $2.77 in 2015 and $4.04 in 2014. Adjusted earnings per share of $5.76 in 2015 increased 5 percent versus $5.51 of adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2014. The increase included benefits from higher adjusted operating profit and a lower share count.

Venezuela Update

At the end of 2015, Kimberly-Clark deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of its Venezuelan business from the company’s balance sheet and moved to the cost method of accounting for its operations in Venezuela. The change reflects the continued deterioration of conditions in the country, including a slowdown in the availability of foreign exchange, and resulted in an after tax charge of $102 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the company will no longer include the results of its Venezuelan business in its consolidated financial statements. Kimberly-Clark continues to manufacture and sell products in Venezuela when foreign exchange is received to pay for imports of raw materials and finished goods. 

2014 Organization Restructuring

In October 2014, Kimberly-Clark initiated a restructuring program in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spin-off of the company’s health care business. The restructuring is intended to improve underlying profitability and increase flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives, brand building and other capabilities critical to delivering future growth.

The restructuring is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, with total costs anticipated to be toward the middle of the previously communicated range of $130 to $160 million after tax ($190 to $230 million pre-tax). Cumulative pre-tax savings from the restructuring are expected to be $120 to $140 million by the end of 2017. Fourth quarter 2015 restructuring costs were $22 million after tax ($27 million pre-tax), bringing cumulative costs to $137 million after tax ($196 million pre-tax). Fourth quarter 2015 savings were $15 million, bringing cumulative savings to $70 million.

2016 Outlook and Key Planning Assumptions

The company’s key planning and guidance assumptions for 2016 are as follows:

•Net sales in a range of down 3 percent to even with the prior year.

-6-

•Organic sales growth of 3 to 5 percent, with volumes up 2 to 3 percent and changes in net selling prices and product mix, combined, up an additional 1 to 2 percent.

•Negative foreign currency exchange rate impact of 5 to 6 percent.

•Adjusted operating profit growth of 2 to 5 percent.

•Cost savings of at least $350 million from the company’s FORCE program.

•Savings of at least $50 million from the 2014 Organization Restructuring.

•Negative foreign currency translation effects of 5 to 6 percent. Currency transaction effects are also anticipated to negatively impact comparisons.

•Impact of changes in key cost inputs expected to be between $100 million of deflation and $50 million of inflation. The company is assuming North American market prices of $840 to $870 per metric ton for eucalyptus pulp and $35 to $45 per barrel for oil. Despite lower oil prices, some oil-based costs are expected to increase due to market-specific dynamics. Costs for materials in some international markets are also expected to increase due to local inflation.

•Advertising spending as a percent of net sales is expected to be similar to, or up slightly, compared to 2015.

•Other (income) and expense, net is anticipated to be less expense than in 2015.

•Net income from equity companies similar to or up somewhat compared to 2015’s level.

•Adjusted effective tax rate between 30.5 and 32.5 percent. The quarterly adjusted effective tax rate in 2016 could vary more than in 2015.

•Adjusted earnings per share of $5.95 to $6.15, up 3 to 7 percent versus $5.76 in 2015.

•Capital spending of $950 to $1,050 million.

•Defined benefit pension plan contributions of up to $100 million.

•Dividend expected to increase mid-single digits, subject to approval by the Board of Directors. The anticipated increase is generally consistent with the 2015 growth in adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of 5 percent.

•Share repurchases are expected to total $600 to $900 million, subject to market conditions.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release and the accompanying tables include the following financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measures:

•Adjusted earnings and earnings per share (including continuing operations)

•Adjusted gross and operating profit

•Adjusted other (income) and expense, net

•Adjusted effective tax rate

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the accompanying non-GAAP reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures:

-7-

•Deconsolidation of Venezuelan business. See previous discussion in this news release. 

•Venezuelan balance sheet remeasurements. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the company recorded a charge for remeasuring the local currency balance sheet in Venezuela at the SICAD II exchange rate. In the first quarter of 2015, following the Venezuelan government’s elimination of the SICAD II exchange rate, the company recorded a charge for remeasuring the local currency balance sheet in Venezuela at the new SIMADI floating exchange rate. 

•Pension settlement charges. In 2015, the company started to offer a lump-sum pension benefit payout option for certain plan participants. In addition, Kimberly-Clark purchased group annuity contracts that transferred to two insurance companies the pension benefit obligations for certain Kimberly-Clark retirees. As a result, the company recognized pension settlement charges in 2015, mostly in the second quarter. 

•Uncertain tax positions. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the company recognized a charge, related to prior years, as a result of an updated assessment of uncertain tax positions for certain international operations. 

•2014 Organization Restructuring. See previous discussion in this news release.

•Turkey restructuring. In the third quarter of 2015, the company initiated actions to restructure its business in Turkey, including the closing of a manufacturing facility. The company incurred after tax charges in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 for this restructuring. The company acquired the remaining 49.9 percent interest in its subsidiary in Turkey in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining 49.9 percent interest in its subsidiary in Israel in the first quarter of 2015.

•Regulatory dispute in the Middle East. In the first quarter of 2014, the company recorded a non-deductible charge as a result of an adverse court ruling regarding the treatment of capital contributions in prior years to an affiliate in the Middle East. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the company recorded a modest amount of income as a result of an updated assessment of the liability related to the dispute.

•Western and Central Europe strategic changes and related restructuring charges. In October 2012, the company initiated strategic changes and a related restructuring in its Western and Central European businesses. The restructuring was completed at the end of 2014.

In addition, this press release includes information regarding organic sales, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency rates.

The company provides these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental information to our GAAP financial measures. Management and the company's Board of Directors use adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted gross and operating profit to (a) evaluate the company's historical and prospective financial performance and its performance relative to its competitors, (b) allocate resources and (c) measure the operational performance of the company's business units and their 

-8-

managers. Management also believes that the use of an adjusted effective tax rate provides improved insight into the tax effects of our ongoing business operations.

Additionally, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the company's Board of Directors has used certain of the non-GAAP financial measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals. These goals are based, in part, on the company's adjusted earnings per share and improvement in the company's adjusted return on invested capital and adjusted operating profit return on sales determined by excluding certain of the charges that are used in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures.
