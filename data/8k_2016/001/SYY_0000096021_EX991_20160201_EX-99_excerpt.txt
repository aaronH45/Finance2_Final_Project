Forward-Looking Statements  

Statements made in this press release or in our earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 that look forward in time or that express management’s beliefs, expectations or hopes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements reflect the views of management at the time such statements are made and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, estimates, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These statements include our plans and expectations related to our three-year financial objectives, including targets for adjusted operating income and adjusted ROIC, and the key levers for realizing these goals, expectations regarding revenue management, expense management and our digital e-commerce strategy, expectations regarding food cost deflation and currency translation, expectations regarding restructuring charges, expectations regarding tax rates, and expectations regarding capital expenditures. The success of our plans and expectations regarding our operating performance, including expectations regarding our three-year financial objectives, are subject to the general risks associated with our business, including the risks of interruption of supplies due to lack of long-term contracts, severe weather, crop conditions, work stoppages, intense competition, technology disruptions, dependence on large regional and national customers, inflation risks, the impact of fuel prices, adverse publicity, and labor issues. Risks and uncertainties also include risks impacting the economy generally, including the risks that the current general economic conditions will deteriorate, or consumer confidence in the economy or consumer spending, particularly on food-away-from-home, may decline. Market conditions may not improve. If sales from our locally managed customers do not grow at the same rate as sales from regional and national customers, our gross margins may decline. Our ability to meet our long-term strategic objectives depends largely on the success of our various business initiatives, including efforts related to revenue management, expense management, our digital e-commerce strategy and any efforts related to restructuring. There are various risks related to these efforts, including the risk that these efforts may not provide the expected benefits in our anticipated time frame, if at all, and may prove costlier than expected; the risk that the actual costs of any initiatives may be greater or less than currently expected; and the risk of adverse effects to our business, results of operations and liquidity if past and future undertakings, and the associated changes to our business, do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate. Our plans related to and the timing of any initiatives are subject to change at any time based on management’s subjective evaluation of our overall business needs. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our efforts, we could become cost disadvantaged in the marketplace, and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease. Capital expenditures may vary based on changes in business plans and other factors, including risks related to the implementation of various initiatives, the timing and successful completion of acquisitions, construction schedules and the possibility that other cash requirements could result in delays or cancellations of capital spending. Periods of high inflation, either overall or in certain product categories, can have a negative impact on us and our customers, as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food-away-from-home market, and may negatively impact our sales, gross profit, operating income and earnings, and periods of deflation can be difficult to manage effectively. Fluctuations in inflation and deflation, as well as fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, are beyond our control and subject to broader market forces. Expanding into international markets presents unique challenges and risks, including compliance with local laws, regulations and customs and the impact of local political and economic conditions, and such expansion efforts may not be successful. Any business that we acquire may not perform as expected, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions. Expectations regarding the accounting treatment of any acquisitions may change based on management’s subjective evaluation. Expectations regarding share repurchases are subject to various factors beyond management’s  

6  

 control, including fluctuations in the stock market, and decisions regarding share repurchases are subject to change based on management’s subjective evaluation of the Company’s needs. Expectations regarding tax rates are also subject to various factors beyond management’s control. For a discussion of additional factors impacting Sysco’s business, see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 27, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Company’s subsequent filings with the SEC. Sysco does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements.

Impact of Certain Items   

(In Thousands, Except for Share and Per Share Data)  

Sysco’s results of operations are impacted by certain items which include restructuring costs (consisting of severance charges, facility closure charges and professional fees incurred related to our three-year financial objectives), merger and integration planning, and termination costs in connection with the merger that had been proposed with US Foods, Inc. (US Foods), and US Foods related financing costs. These fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 items are collectively referred to as “Certain Items”. Management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, operating margin as a percentage of sales, interest expense, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these Certain Items provides an important perspective with respect to our results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that removes these items which are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated, and which, as a result are difficult to include in analyst’s financial models and our investors’ expectations with any degree of specificity. Sysco believes the adjusted totals facilitate comparison on a year-over-year basis.  

The company uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP measures in assessing the company’s results of operations for the periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. As a result, in the tables that follow, each period presented is adjusted to remove the Certain Items noted above.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  The net earnings and diluted earnings per share impacts are shown net of tax. The tax impact of adjustments for Certain Items was $1,315 and $46,224 for the 13-week periods ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively. Amounts are calculated by multiplying the pretax impact of each Certain Item by the statutory rates in effect for each jurisdiction.  

 (2)  Individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to the total presented due to rounding. Total diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings for certain items divided by diluted shares outstanding.

Free Cash Flow  

(In Thousands)  

Free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment and includes proceeds from sales of plant and equipment. Sysco considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases and sales of buildings, fleet, equipment and technology, which may potentially be used to pay for, among other things, strategic uses of cash including dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions. However, free cash flow may not be available for discretionary expenditures, as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments. Free cash flow should not be used as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP measure in assessing the company’s liquidity for the periods presented. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. In the table that follows, free cash flow for each period presented are reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities.

Real Growth  

Real growth represents our sales growth after removing the impact of food cost inflation / deflation, sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last 12 months and the impact of foreign exchange rate translation. Sysco considers real growth to be a performance measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of sales growth organically generated. Real growth is a commonly used metric within the food-away-from-home industry. The company uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating its financial results, as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP measures in assessing the company’s sales growth for the periods presented.
