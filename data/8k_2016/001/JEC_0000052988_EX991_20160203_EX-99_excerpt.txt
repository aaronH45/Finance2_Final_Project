This compares to net earnings of $100 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, on revenues of $3.2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 ended December 26, 2014. Included in the Company's first quarter adjusted net earnings is a $11 million, or $0.09 per share, tax benefit related to an international tax matter.

The Company's adjusted net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 exclude the after-tax costs related to certain restructuring activities that began during fiscal 2015 (the "2015 Restructuring") totaling $48 million, or $0.40 per diluted share.

environment, we delivered results aligned with our expectations. This performance was due to our diverse portfolio of customers, geographic footprint and improvements in project delivery execution. Our performance was also supported by our efforts to realign our business and streamline operations, which continues to benefit the Company and right-sizes it in light of current economic conditions."

Commenting on the Company’s reorganization and its earnings outlook, Jacobs Chief Financial Officer Kevin Berryman stated, “The Company remains on track to implement revised segment reporting for our Q2 results, given that the company has begun managing its operations during Q2 along the previously announced four lines of business: Petroleum & Chemicals, Building & Infrastructure, Aerospace & Technology, and Industrial. Regarding our outlook, although the Company met expectations in the quarter, continuing challenges in certain end-markets require us to remain cautious as to our near-term outlook. Considering the benefits we're realizing from our recent restructuring activities, we are confirming our fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS range of $2.80 to $3.30, including the discrete international tax item."

Jacobs is hosting a conference call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, February 3, 2016, which it is webcasting live on the internet at www.jacobs.com.
