SECTION 2 – FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

On February 1, 2016, Sysco Corporation (“Sysco”) issued a press release announcing its results of operations and financial condition for its second quarter of fiscal year 2016, which ended on December 26, 2015. Sysco hereby incorporates by reference herein the information set forth in its press release dated February 1, 2016 (the “Press Release”), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.  

Except for the historical information contained in this report, the statements made by Sysco are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. All such statements are subject to the safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Sysco’s future financial performance could differ significantly from the expectations of management and from results expressed or implied in the Press Release. Forward-looking statements in the Press Release are subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in the Press Release. For further information on other risk factors, please refer to the “Risk Factors” contained in Sysco’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

The Press Release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures that are adjusted to exclude certain items to provide an important perspective with respect to our results and meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that removes these items which are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated, and which, as a result, are difficult to include in analysts’ financial models and our investors’ expectations with any degree of specificity. The non-GAAP measures presented in the Press Release and the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP include the following:  

   •   For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, operating income increased 37.1% to $433 million and adjusted operating income increased 10.2% to $437 million; diluted EPS increased 77.8% to $0.48 and adjusted diluted EPS increased $0.07 to $0.48.  

   •   For the first half of fiscal 2016, operating income increased 18.6% to $926 million and adjusted operating income increased 4.2% to $943 million; diluted EPS increased 21% to $0.88 and adjusted diluted EPS increased $0.07 to $1.00.  

The Press Release includes other non-GAAP financial measures that are presented with the directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The adjusted non-GAAP financial measures presented here and in the Press Release should be analyzed in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measures.  

The information in this Item 2.02 is being furnished, not filed, pursuant to Item 2.02 of Form 8-K. Accordingly, the information in Item 2.02 of this report, including the Press Release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed by Sysco under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference.
