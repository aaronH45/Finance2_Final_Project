NEW YORK, January 28, 2016 – L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: LLL) today reported adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $2.16 and diluted loss per share from continuing operations of $0.76 for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 (2015 fourth quarter). Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 (2014 fourth quarter) was $2.34. Net sales of $2.9 billion for the 2015 fourth quarter decreased by 3% compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Excluding sales from divestitures(2) and acquisitions(2), net sales (organic sales) increased 1%. The prior period results have been adjusted to present the National Security Solutions business as discontinued operations.  

“In the fourth quarter, we continued the progress we made on our transformation throughout 2015, highlighted by our announcement of the sale of our National Security Solutions (NSS) business.” said Michael T. Strianese, chairman and chief executive officer. “Our strategic portfolio shaping efforts and solid program execution allowed us to focus on higher returning, higher margin businesses where we have market leading positions, supporting organic growth and increased segment operating margins. While there is still work to do, we are seeing benefits of our refined strategy. Our organic sales growth for the quarter was 1% and we strengthened our offerings in key markets through our ForceX acquisition, which will expand our brand and market share in 2016 and beyond.”  

“While we are disappointed in our 2015 book-to-bill ratio, which was impacted by lower than anticipated international awards at Aerospace Systems, our other two segments generated healthy orders from the DoD and other U.S. Government customers. Looking ahead to 2016, we are a leaner, more focused company with robust cash flows operating in what we believe will be a more stable budgetary environment. We are confident that our ongoing efforts will drive additional organic growth in 2016 and enable us to continue returning capital to shareholders.”  

 (1)  Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Table E for a reconciliation and a discussion on why this information is presented.  

 (2)  Sales from business divestitures are defined as sales from business divestitures that are included in L-3’s actual results for the 12 months prior to the divestitures. Sales from acquired businesses are defined as sales from business acquisitions that are included in L-3’s actual results for less than 12 months.  

 L-3 Announces Results for the 2015 Fourth Quarter     Page 2  

Funded orders of $2.6 billion for the quarter included the following key wins:  

   •   a contract to design, manufacture, qualify, test and deliver Integrated Power Node Center/Power Node Control Center (IPNC/PNCC) units to General Dynamics Bath Iron Works,  

   •   a contract to deliver two night vision product variants, monocular and binocular, to the Saudi Ministry of Defense, Land Forces,

   •   a contract to provide an Airbus A320 Full Flight Simulator to Spring Airlines.  

Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for the 2015 fourth quarter excludes: (1) goodwill impairment charges of $349 million ($230 million after income taxes), or $2.93 per diluted share, including $338 million related to a decline in the estimated fair value of the Logistics Solutions reporting unit and $11 million related to the re-allocation of goodwill to a business unit retained by L-3 in connection with the expected sale of the National Security Solutions business and (2) a pre-tax loss of $2 million ($2 million after income taxes), or $0.02 per diluted share, related to the divestiture of Klein Associates, Inc., which was completed on December 31, 2015 for a sales price of $10 million.  

Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 excludes: (1) goodwill impairment charges of $384 million ($264 million after income taxes), or $3.22 per diluted share, including $338 million related to a decline in the estimated fair value of the Logistics Solutions reporting unit, and $46 million related to the re-allocation of goodwill and an impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2015 to a business retained by L-3 in connection with the expected sale of the National Security Solutions business and (2) a pre-tax loss of $31 million ($20 million after income taxes), or $0.25 per diluted share, related to business divestitures, of which $17 million relates to the divestiture of Marine Systems International (MSI), completed on May 29, 2015, $8 million relates to the Tinsley Product Line divestiture completed on July 27, 2015, $4 million relates to the Broadcast Sports, Inc. (BSI) divestiture, completed on April 24, 2015, and $2 million relates to the Klein Associates, Inc. divestiture, completed on December 31, 2015.  

The goodwill impairment charges and pre-tax losses related to business divestitures are included in consolidated operating (loss) income. Segment operating income represents earnings from the Company’s business segments before the goodwill impairment charges and pre-tax losses related to business divestitures. Segment operating income is used by management for purposes of evaluating the operating performance of the Company’s business segments.

Fourth Quarter Results of Operations: For the 2015 fourth quarter, consolidated net sales of $2.9 billion decreased $90 million, or 3%, compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Organic sales growth for the 2015 fourth quarter was $40 million, or 1%. Organic sales growth excludes $167 million of sales declines related to business divestitures and $37 million of sales increases from business acquisitions. Sales to the U.S. Government increased 3%, or $66 million, to $2,029 million in the 2015 fourth quarter, compared to $1,963 million in the 2014 fourth quarter. Sales to international and commercial customers declined 19%, or $156 million, to $842 million in the 2015 fourth quarter, compared to $998 million in the 2014 fourth quarter. Organic sales to international and commercial customers decreased $22 million, or 3%.  

Segment operating income for the 2015 fourth quarter decreased $39 million, or 13%, compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Segment operating income as a percentage of sales (segment operating margin) decreased by 100 basis points to 8.9% for the 2015 fourth quarter compared to 9.9% for the 2014 fourth quarter. This decrease was driven by higher pension expense of $14 million and unfavorable contract performance adjustments primarily in the Aerospace Systems segment. See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin trends.  

The effective income tax rate for the 2015 fourth quarter is not meaningful due to the goodwill impairment charges. Excluding the goodwill impairment charges and related income tax benefit, the effective income tax rate for the 2015 fourth quarter would have decreased to 17.4% compared to 19.6% primarily due to an increased benefit from the Federal Research and Experimentation (R&E) Tax Credit, which was permanently reenacted on December 18, 2015.  

Net (loss) income from continuing operations attributable to L-3 in the 2015 fourth quarter decreased by $261 million to a loss of $60 million, compared to income of $201 million in the 2014 fourth quarter. Diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased by $3.10 to a loss of $0.76 from $2.34 in the 2014 fourth quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased 8% to $2.16. Diluted weighted average common  

 L-3 Announces Results for the 2015 Fourth Quarter     Page 4  

 shares outstanding for the 2015 fourth quarter declined by 9% compared to the 2014 fourth quarter due to share repurchases.  

Full Year Results of Operations: For the year ended December 31, 2015, consolidated net sales of $10.5 billion decreased $520 million, or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Organic sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 declined $269 million, or 3%. Organic sales exclude $354 million related to business divestitures and $103 million from business acquisitions. Sales to the U.S. Government declined 2%, or $173 million, to $7,291 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $7,464 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, driven primarily by U.S. defense budget constraints and reductions from sequestration, and by the U.S. military drawdown in Afghanistan. Sales to international and commercial customers declined 10%, or $347 million, to $3,175 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $3,522 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Organic sales to international and commercial customers decreased $92 million, or 3%, driven by foreign currency exchange rate changes.  

Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $122 million, or 12%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Segment operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 9.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was driven by higher pension expense of $61 million and unfavorable contract performance adjustments at the Aerospace Systems segment, partially offset by outside accounting and legal advisory expenses incurred in 2014 for the Internal Review completed in October 2014. See the reportable segment results below for additional discussion of sales and operating margin trends.  

The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 is not meaningful due to the goodwill impairment charges. Excluding the goodwill impairment charges and related income tax benefit, the effective income tax rate for 2015 would have decreased to 20.5%. The decrease is primarily due to: (1) $17 million of foreign tax benefits related to a legal restructuring of our foreign entities and (2) an increased benefit from the Federal Research and Experimentation Tax Credit.  

Net income from continuing operations attributable to L-3 in the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to $282 million, compared to $632 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased 52% to $3.44 from $7.20 in the year ended December 31, 2014. Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to L-3 decreased 10% to $566 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased 4% to $6.91. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2015 declined by 7% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to repurchases of L-3 common stock.  

Orders: Funded orders for the 2015 fourth quarter were $2.6 billion, a decrease of 18.7% compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Funded orders for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $9.9 billion, compared to $11.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. The book-to-bill ratio was 0.89x for the 2015 fourth quarter and 0.94x for the year ended December 31, 2015. Funded backlog declined 13% to $8.4 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to $9.7 billion at December 31, 2014, due to the divestiture of MSI and a book-to-bill ratio of less than 1.  

Cash flow and cash returned to shareholders: Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations decreased by $49 million, or 10%, to $465 million for the 2015 fourth quarter, compared to $514 million for the 2014 fourth quarter. Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations decreased by $71 million, or 7%, to $1,021 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1,092 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in net cash from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to lower net income partially offset by lower working capital requirements in the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.  

 L-3 Announces Results for the 2015 Fourth Quarter     Page 5  

The table below summarizes the cash returned to shareholders during the 2015 and 2014 fourth quarter and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (1)  Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less net capital expenditures (capital expenditures less cash proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and equipment), plus income tax payments attributable to discontinued operations. Free cash flow represents cash generated after paying for interest on borrowings, income taxes, pension benefit contributions, capital expenditures and changes in working capital, but before repaying principal amount of outstanding debt, paying cash dividends on common stock, repurchasing shares of our common stock, investing cash to acquire businesses, and making other strategic investments. Thus, a key assumption underlying free cash flow is that the company will be able to refinance its existing debt. Because of this assumption, free cash flow is not a measure that should be relied upon to represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.  

   (2) Free cash flow from discontinued operations is not included above.  

Reportable Segment Results  

Electronic Systems  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Fourth Quarter: Electronic Systems net sales for the 2015 fourth quarter decreased by $118 million, or 9%, compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Excluding $167 million related to the divestitures of MSI, BSI and the Tinsley Product Line and $24 million related to the CTC and ForceX acquisitions, organic sales increased by $25 million, or 2%. The increase is driven by: (1) $28 million for Aviation Products & Security Systems due to increased deliveries of airport and cargo security system products to international customers and cockpit avionics products to commercial and DoD customers, (2) $10 million primarily for Precision Engagement and Training due to increased deliveries of simulation devices to the DoD, partially offset by completed contracts for simulation devices to commercial customers and ordnance products to the U.S. military, and (3) $8 million for Sensor Systems, primarily due to deliveries of electronic warfare products to the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence and increased volume for photonics masts and surface ship stabilizing products to the U.S. Navy. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $21 million at Warrior Systems related to a holographic weapons sight refund program at the EoTech business further discussed below.  

Electronic Systems operating income for the 2015 fourth quarter decreased by $16 million, or 10%, compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Operating margin decreased by 20 basis points to 11.3%. Operating margin decreased by: (1) 70 basis points due to sales mix changes primarily for Aviation Products & Security Systems, Sensor Systems, and Power & Propulsion Systems, (2) 20 basis points due to higher pension expense of $3 million and (3) 20 basis points due to higher severance costs of $2 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases of: (1) 40 basis points due to acquisitions and divestitures and (2) 50 basis points for favorable contract performance adjustments primarily for Sensor Systems.  

In November 2015, the Company commenced a voluntary refund program and began accepting customer returns for various EoTech holographic weapons sight (HWS) products affected by certain performance issues. The refund program gives eligible owners of the affected HWS products the option to obtain a refund of the purchase price, including shipping costs. The estimated refund program liability of $20 million is based on several factors, including the number of HWS units that the Company anticipates purchasers will return for a refund.  

 L-3 Announces Results for the 2015 Fourth Quarter     Page 6  

The refund program is in the early stages of implementation, and the Company will continue to evaluate the amount of the refund liability. This may cause a material adjustment to the liability.  

Full Year: Electronic Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $376 million, or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding $354 million related to the divestitures of MSI, BSI, and the Tinsley Product Line, and $49 million for the CTC and ForceX acquisitions, organic sales declined $71 million, or 2%. The decrease was due to: (1) $85 million related to foreign currency exchange rate changes and (2) $44 million related to reduced sales at Warrior Systems driven by lower volume for night vision goggles and the holographic weapons sight refund program at EoTech discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by $58 million, primarily for Aviation Products & Security Systems, due to deliveries of airport security systems products to international customers and cockpit avionics products to commercial and DoD customers.  

Electronic Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $44 million, or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating margin remained at 11.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating margin increased by: (1) 50 basis points due to acquisitions and divestitures, (2) 40 basis points for favorable contract performance adjustments and (3) 20 basis points due to lower severance expense of $8 million. These increases were offset by decreases of: (1) 80 basis points primarily due to lower volume for Sensor Systems and sales mix changes for Aviation Products & Security and (2) 30 basis points due to higher pension expense of $13 million.  

Aerospace Systems 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Fourth Quarter: Aerospace Systems net sales for the 2015 fourth quarter decreased by $83 million, or 7%, compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Sales decreased $60 million for Aircraft Systems, $20 million for Logistics Solutions and $3 million for ISR Systems. Sales decreased for Aircraft Systems due to lower volume of: (1) $34 million for foreign military aircraft modification contracts, including $12 million for the Australian C-27J aircraft, (2) $19 million for modification contracts primarily for the U.S. Navy maritime patrol aircraft, (3) $14 million primarily due to less modification work on the United States Air Force (USAF) Compass Call aircraft and (4) $12 million for aircraft cabin assemblies and subassemblies due to timing of deliveries. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts of $19 million. The decrease in sales for Logistics Solutions was due to lower volume for field maintenance and sustainment services, primarily for U.S. Army and U.S. Navy aircraft due to the completion of contracts and reduced flight hours and lower sell prices resulting from competitive pressures. Sales decreased for ISR Systems due to lower volume of: (1) $33 million for small ISR aircraft fleet management services primarily to the DoD due to the U.S. military drawdown in Afghanistan and (2) $30 million primarily for large ISR aircraft systems for foreign military customers as contracts near completion. The decreases were partially offset by higher volume of $48 million for large ISR aircraft systems for the U.S. Government and $12 million for small ISR aircraft systems to the DoD.  

Aerospace Systems operating income for the 2015 fourth quarter decreased by $30 million, or 33%, compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Operating margin decreased by 220 basis points to 5.7%. Operating margin decreased by: (1) 180 basis points due to lower volume and sales mix changes primarily at Logistics Solutions and Aircraft Systems, (2) 70 basis points due to higher pension expense of $7 million and (3) 60 basis points due to unfavorable contract performance adjustments primarily at Aircraft Systems. These decreases were partially offset by: (1) 70 basis points for improved performance primarily on the Army C-12 contract due to better terms on the new contract which began on August 1, 2015, and $8 million due to a partial recovery of cost overruns recognized in prior periods on the previous contract that ended on July 31, 2015, and (2) 20 basis points due to a termination settlement of $3 million for a commercial aerostructures contract.  

 L-3 Announces Results for the 2015 Fourth Quarter     Page 7  

Full Year: Aerospace Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $165 million, or 4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Sales decreased $159 million for Aircraft Systems and $63 million for Logistic Solutions. Sales for ISR Systems increased by $57 million. Sales decreased for Aircraft Systems due to lower volume of: (1) $74 million primarily on the USAF Compass Call aircraft and the DoD’s retirement of the Joint Cargo Aircraft, (2) $39 million on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts primarily due to unfavorable contract performance adjustments, (3) $28 million for modification contracts primarily for the U.S. Navy maritime patrol aircraft and (4) $18 million primarily for aircraft cabin assemblies and subassemblies. The decrease in sales for Logistics Solutions was due to lower volume for field maintenance and sustainment services, primarily for U.S. Army and U.S. Navy aircraft due to the completion of contracts and lower demand and lower prices due to competitive pressures. The increase in ISR Systems was due to an increase in sales of $182 million primarily for large ISR aircraft systems for U.S. Government customers and small ISR aircraft systems to the DoD and a foreign government, partially offset by $125 million of lower sales for small ISR aircraft fleet management services to the DoD due to the U.S. military drawdown in Afghanistan.  

Aerospace Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $78 million, or 28%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating margin decreased by 160 basis points to 4.9%. Operating margin decreased by: (1) 250 basis points due to contract performance adjustments at Aircraft Systems, which includes $101 million of cost growth on international head-of-state aircraft modification contracts, compared to $15 million of cost growth on the same contracts in the year ended December 31, 2014, (2) 100 basis points primarily due to reduced flight hours and lower pricing due to competitive pressures on logistics and maintenance contracts, including the U.S. Navy T-45 contract and (3) 70 basis points due to higher pension expense of $28 million. These decreases were partially offset by: (1) 110 basis points due to favorable contract performance adjustments at ISR Systems, (2) 70 basis points for improved performance on the Army C-12 contract due to better terms on the new contract and $18 million due to a partial recovery of cost overruns recognized in prior periods on the previous contract, (3) 40 basis points due to a $17 million increase in reserves for excess and obsolete inventory at Logistics Solutions recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 and (4) 40 basis points due to $25 million of outside accounting and legal advisory expenses incurred for the Internal Review completed in October 2014.  

Communication Systems 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Fourth Quarter: Communication Systems net sales for the 2015 fourth quarter increased by $111 million, or 23%, compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Excluding $14 million related to the Miteq, Inc. acquisition, organic sales increased $97 million, or 20%. The increase was due to: (1) $34 million for Broadband Communication Systems, primarily due to increased volume for development and production of secure networked communication systems for the DoD, (2) $28 million for Tactical Satellite Communications products due to higher volume on a satellite communication land terminals contract for the Australian Defence Force (ADF), partially offset by reduced deliveries of mobile and ground-based satellite communication systems for the U.S. military, (3) $22 million for Advanced Communications products due to higher volume for secure data recorders and communication systems for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and a foreign government and (4) $13 million for Space & Power Systems due to increased deliveries of power devices for commercial satellites.  

Communication Systems operating income for the 2015 fourth quarter increased by $7 million, or 14%, compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Operating margin decreased by 80 basis points to 9.7% driven primarily by higher pension expense of $4 million.  

Full Year: Communication Systems net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $21 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding $55 million related to the Miteq, Inc. acquisition, organic sales declined by $34 million, or 2%. The decrease was due to: (1) $37 million for Space & Power Systems, primarily satellite command and control software for U.S. Government agencies and high frequency radios for a foreign government and (2) $20 million for Advanced Communications products,  

 L-3 Announces Results for the 2015 Fourth Quarter     Page 8  

 primarily secure data recorders and communications equipment for the U.S. military as contracts near completion. These decreases were offset by $23 million for Broadband Communication Systems, primarily due to increased volume for development and production of secure networked communication systems for the U.S. military. For Tactical Satellite Communications products, lower sales of mobile and ground based satellite communication systems for the U.S. military were offset by sales on a new contract for the ADF.  

Communication Systems operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 remained the same at $196 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating margin decreased by 10 basis points to 9.6%. Operating margin decreased by 100 basis points due to higher pension expense of $20 million. Improved contract performance and sales and mix changes, partially offset by lower margins from the Miteq, Inc. business acquisition increased operating margin by 90 basis points.

Financial Guidance  

Based on information known as of today, the company has updated its consolidated and segment financial guidance for the year ending December 31, 2016. The 2016 guidance was previously provided on December 8, 2015. All financial guidance amounts are estimates subject to change in the future, including as a result of matters discussed under the “Forward-Looking Statements” cautionary language beginning on page 10. The company undertakes no duty to update its guidance.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The revisions to our Current Guidance compared to our Prior Guidance primarily include:  

   •   A decrease in the estimated effective tax rate for U.S. Federal R&E tax credit of $19 million, and  

   •   A net pension expense decrease of $32 million to a $9 million net pension benefit, compared to a net pension expense of $23 million included in the prior guidance. The estimated decrease in net pension expense will increase 2016 operating margin by approximately 30 basis points and diluted EPS by $0.25. The decrease in pension expense is due to: (i) $25 million related to a change in the approach to measure service and interest costs and (ii) $7 million primarily related to an 18 basis point increase in the estimated weighted average discount rate to 4.63% from 4.45% assumed in prior guidance.  

The current guidance for 2016 excludes: (i) any potential non-cash goodwill impairment charges for which the information is presently unknown and (ii) additional expenses relating to the Internal Review at Aerospace Systems, which was completed in October 2014.  

Additional financial information regarding the 2015 fourth quarter and full year results and the 2016 financial guidance is available on the company’s website at www.L-3com.com.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(in millions, except per share amounts)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  Adjusted diluted EPS is diluted EPS attributable to L-3 Holdings’ common stockholders, excluding the charges or credits relating to business divestitures and non-cash goodwill impairment charges. Adjusted net income attributable to L-3 is net income attributable to L-3, excluding the charges or credits relating to business divestitures and non-cash goodwill impairment charges. These amounts are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The company believes that the charges or credits relating to business divestitures and non-cash goodwill impairment charges affect the comparability of the results of operations for 2015 to the results of operations for 2014. The company also believes that disclosing net income and diluted EPS excluding the charges or credits relating to business divestitures and non-cash goodwill impairment charges will allow investors to more easily compare the 2015 results to the 2014 results. However, these measures may not be defined or calculated by other companies in the same manner.  

 (2)  Amounts may not recalculate directly due to rounding.
