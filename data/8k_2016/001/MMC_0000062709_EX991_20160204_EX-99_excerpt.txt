Non-GAAP Measures

Three Months Ended December 31

(Millions) (Unaudited)

The Company presents below certain additional financial measures that are "non-GAAP measures," within the meaning of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These measures are: adjusted operating income (loss); adjusted operating margin; and adjusted income, net of tax.

The Company presents these non-GAAP measures to provide investors with additional information to analyze the Company's performance from period to period. Management also uses these measures to assess performance for incentive compensation purposes and to allocate resources in managing the Company's businesses. However, investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports in accordance with GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP measures reflect subjective determinations by management, and may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.

Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Operating Margin

Adjusted operating income (loss) is calculated by excluding the impact of certain noteworthy items from the Company's GAAP operating income or loss. The following tables identify these noteworthy items and reconcile adjusted operating income (loss) to GAAP operating income or loss, on a consolidated and segment basis, for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The following tables also present adjusted operating margin, which is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by consolidated or segment GAAP revenue less the gain on the disposal of Mercer's U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a) Primarily severance for center led initiatives, future rent under non-cancellable leases, and integration costs related to recent acquisitions.

(b) Primarily includes the change in fair value as measured each quarter of contingent consideration related to acquisitions.

(c) Relates to a gain on the disposal of Mercer's U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business. This $37 million gain is also removed from GAAP revenue in the calculation of adjusted operating margin.
