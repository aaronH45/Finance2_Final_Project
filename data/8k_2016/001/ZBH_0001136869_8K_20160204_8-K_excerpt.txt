 Item 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.  

On February 4, 2016, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an underwriting agreement with certain funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the “Selling Stockholders”), and Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Underwriter”) relating to the offer and sale by the Selling Stockholders of 11,027,558 shares of common stock of the Company. The Company will not receive any of the proceeds of the sale of the shares of common stock by the Selling Stockholders. The underwriting agreement also provided for the purchase by the Company of 2,599,833 of the shares of common stock being sold by the Selling Stockholders in such offering from the Underwriter for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $250 million. The sale of such shares of common stock by the Selling Stockholders and the Company’s concurrent share repurchase were both completed on February 10, 2016.  

The underwriting agreement contains representations and warranties and covenants that are customary for transactions of this type. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify the Underwriter against certain liabilities on customary terms.  

The Underwriter and its affiliates have provided in the past to the Company and its affiliates and may provide from time to time in the future certain commercial banking, financial advisory, investment banking and other services for the Company and such affiliates in the ordinary course of its business, for which it has received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions. Prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the underwriting agreement, the Selling Stockholders collectively held more than 7.3% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock and may have been deemed to have shared beneficial ownership of a total of more than 14.9% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. Each Selling Stockholder is also party to the Company’s existing stockholders agreement dated April 24, 2014 and amended March 30, 2015, among the Company, the Selling Stockholders and the other parties thereto, which among other things permits the stockholders of the Company party thereto to designate two members of the Company’s board of directors.  

The offering of the shares of common stock of the Company by the Selling Stockholders was made pursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-209390), the prospectus dated February 4, 2016 and the related prospectus supplement dated February 4, 2016.  

The foregoing description of the underwriting agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the underwriting agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of the underwriting agreement has been included to provide information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company. In particular, investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.  

 Item 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.  

On February 4, 2016, the Company issued a press release announcing the launch of the offering by the Selling Stockholders and the Company’s concurrent share repurchase.
