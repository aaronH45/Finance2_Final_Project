® Financial Overview 6 Funding costs 1. Adjusted to include the impact of leases reclassified to other-earning assets. Non-GAAP; see appendix for reconciliation. 2. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Regions corrected the accounting for certain leases which had previously been included in loans. The cumulative effect on pre-tax income lowered net interest income and other financing income $15 million and reduced the net interest margin by 5 basis points in the quarter. The company does not expect this adjustment to have a material impact to net interest income and other financing income or net interest margin in any future reporting period.

® 2016 Expectations  Average Loan growth 3 – 5%  Average Deposit growth 2 – 4% Net interest income and other financing income up 2 – 4%(1)  Adjusted non-interest income up 4 – 6%  Adjusted expenses flat to up modestly: efficiency ratio <63%  Operating leverage of 2 – 4%(1) Net charge-offs 25 – 35bps 16 (1) The Company expects to increase net interest income and other financing income in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent in 2016, commensurate with average loan growth in the 3 percent to 5 percent range. The high end of the range assumes an interest rate scenario equal to the market forward interest rates as of November 6, 2015, while the low end of the range assumes interest rates remain relatively unchanged from current low levels. However, new information learned after the November 6, 2015 estimation date increases the risk to the Company that it can achieve the high end of the target range. The new information includes legislation signed into law setting the dividend paid to Regions on Federal Reserve stock at the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate. Based on that rate at December 31, 2015, the reduction in the dividend paid to Regions is estimated to be approximately $18 million annually.

® During the fourth quarter 2015, Regions corrected the accounting for certain leases which had previously been included in loans. These leases had been classified as capital leases but were subsequently determined to be operating leases. The adjustment resulted in a reclassification of these leases out of loans into other earning assets. Regions believes including the impact of the operating leases, reported as capital leases prior to the fourth quarter of 2015, provides a meaningful calculation of loan and lease growth rates and presents them on the same basis as that applied by management. Total loans (GAAP) is presented including the lease adjustment to arrive at adjusted total loans and leases (non-GAAP).

® NM - Not Meaningful (1) Regions recorded $50 million and $100 million of contingent legal and regulatory accruals during the second quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014, respectively, related to previously disclosed matters. The fourth quarter of 2014 accruals were settled in the second quarter of 2015 for $2 million less than originally estimated and a corresponding recovery was recognized. (2) In the fourth quarter of 2013, Regions recorded a non-tax deductible charge of $58 million related to previously disclosed inquiries from government authorities concerning matters from 2009. The 2013 matters were settled in the second quarter of 2014 for $7 million less than originally estimated and a corresponding recovery was recognized. (3) In the fourth quarter of 2012, Regions entered into an agreement with a third party investor in Regions Asset Management Company, Inc., pursuant to which the investment was fully redeemed. This resulted in extinguishing a $203 million liability, including accrued, unpaid interest, as well as incurring early termination costs of approximately $42 million on a pre-tax basis ($38 million after tax). (4) Insurance proceeds recognized in 2015 are related to the settlement of the previously disclosed 2010 class-action lawsuit. (5) In the third quarter of 2013, Regions recorded a $24 million gain on sale of a non-core portion of a Wealth Management business. The table below presents computations of the efficiency ratio (non-GAAP), which is a measure of productivity, generally calculated as non-interest expense divided by total revenue. Management uses this ratio to monitor performance and believes this measure provides meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non- GAAP). Net interest income and other financing income on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the efficiency ratio. Regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions’ business. It is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur; however, management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.
