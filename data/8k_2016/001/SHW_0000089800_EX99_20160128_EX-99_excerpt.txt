CLEVELAND, OHIO, January 28, 2016 - The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE: SHW) announced its financial results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015. Compared to the same periods in 2014, consolidated net sales increased $209.8 million, or 1.9%, to $11.34 billion in the year and increased $35.2 million, or 1.4%, to $2.60 billion in the quarter due primarily to higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores and Consumer Groups. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased consolidated net sales 3.3% in the year and 3.6% in the quarter.  

Diluted net income per common share in the year increased to $11.16 per share from $8.78 per share in 2014 and increased in the quarter to $2.12 per share compared to $1.37 per share a year ago. The increases in full year and fourth quarter diluted net income per common share were due primarily to improved operating results of the Paint Stores and Consumer Groups. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased diluted net income per common share by $.26 per share for the year and $.06 per share in the quarter.  

Net sales in the Paint Stores Group increased 5.2% to $7.21 billion in the year and increased 5.9% to $1.68 billion in the quarter due primarily to higher architectural paint sales volume across all end market segments. Net sales from stores open for more than twelve calendar months increased 4.2% in the year and 5.1% in the quarter over last year’s comparable periods. Paint Stores Group segment profit increased to $1.43 billion in the year from $1.20 billion last year and increased to $316.1 million in the quarter from $247.5 million last year due primarily to higher paint sales volume. Segment profit as a percent to net sales increased in the year to 19.9% from 17.5% in 2014 and increased in the quarter to 18.9% from 15.6% last year.  

Net sales of the Consumer Group increased 11.1% to $1.58 billion in the year and increased 13.6% to $314.6 million in the quarter due primarily to sales of HGTV HOME® by Sherwin-Williams paint to Lowe’s stores. Segment profit increased to $308.8 million in the year from $252.9 million last year and increased $20.6 million to $50.9 million from $30.3 million last year due primarily to improved operating efficiencies.

Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased net sales 7.5% and 7.1% in the year and quarter, respectively. Stated in U.S. dollars, segment profit in the year was essentially flat at $201.9 million compared to $201.1 million last year due primarily to decreasing raw material costs and good cost control partially offset by unfavorable currency translation rate changes and a gain on the early termination of a customer agreement in the third quarter 2014. Segment profit increased in the quarter to $50.6 million from $39.0 million last year due primarily to decreasing raw material costs and good cost control partially offset by unfavorable currency translation rate changes.

The Latin America Coatings Group’s net sales stated in U.S. dollars decreased 18.2% to $631.0 million in the year and decreased 23.5% to $158.7 million in the quarter due primarily to unfavorable currency translation rate changes and lower paint sales volume partially offset by selling price increases. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased net sales by 19.3% and 21.4% in the year and quarter, respectively. Stated in U.S. dollars, segment profit in the year decreased to $18.5 million compared to $40.5 million last year and decreased to $2.8 million in the quarter from $13.0 million last year due primarily to increasing raw material costs, lower paint sales volume, and unfavorable currency translation rate changes partially offset by selling price increases. Foreign currency translation rate changes reduced segment profit $16.0 million in the year and decreased segment profit $5.3 million in the quarter. As a percent to net external sales, segment profit was 2.9% in twelve months compared to 5.2% in 2014 and 1.8% in the quarter versus 6.3% in the fourth quarter last year.  

The Company acquired 1.00 million shares of its common stock through open market purchases in the quarter bringing our total purchased to 3.58 million shares in the year. The Company had remaining authorization at December 31, 2015 to purchase 11.65 million shares.  

Commenting on the financial results, John G. Morikis, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “It is gratifying to report another year of record performances in sales, net income, which surpassed $1.0 billion for the first time, earnings per share, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and net operating cash.  

“Over the past year, our Paint Stores Group grew architectural sales volume across every end market segment and delivered positive operating results. The Consumer Group improved its operating results through improved operating efficiencies. The HGTV HOME® by Sherwin-Williams paint program continues to drive sales improvements in Consumer Group. Our Global Finishes Group improved segment profit as a percent to sales through greater operating efficiencies and good cost control. The Latin America Coatings Group continues to manage through the negative effects of currency devaluation and weak end market demand in some geographies by raising selling prices and good cost control.  

“We continue to generate significant cash from operations allowing us to invest in the business and return a substantial portion to our shareholders. In 2015, we generated net operating cash flow of $1.45 billion. Our working capital ratio (accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable to sales) at December 31, 2015 was 8.6% compared to 10.1% last year. In 2015, we added 83 net new stores, finishing the year with 4,086 stores in operation. During the year, we continued to buy our stock on the open market and increased our annual cash dividend approximately 22% to $2.68 per common share. Our balance sheet remains flexible and is positioned well for future acquisitions and other investments in our business.  

“In the first quarter of 2016, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase a low single digit percentage compared to the first quarter of 2015. At that anticipated sales level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter of 2016 will be in the range of $1.50 to $1.65 per share compared to $1.38 per share earned in the first quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect consolidated net sales to increase a low single digit percentage compared to full year 2015. With annual sales at that level, we anticipate diluted net income per common share for 2016 will be in the range of $12.20 to $12.40 per share compared to $11.16 per share earned in 2015.”
