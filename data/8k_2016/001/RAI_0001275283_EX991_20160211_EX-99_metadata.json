        " * American Snuff is now reporting market share information based on shipments to retail (STR) data, instead of information based on sampling of retail moist snuff sales, referred to as retail scan data. Management believes that STR data provides a more complete indicator of the performance of American Snuff's brands as well as overall market trends, than retail scan data. All share information has been restated to reflect STR data. You should not rely on the STR data reported by MSAi as being a precise measurement of actual market share as the shipments to retail do not reflect actual consumer sales and do not track all volume and trade channels. Accordingly, the STR data in the U.S. moist snuff market of American Snuff and it's brands may overstate or understate their actual market share."
