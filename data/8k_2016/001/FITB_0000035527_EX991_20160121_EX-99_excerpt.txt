 (b) These ratios have been included herein to facilitate a greater understanding of the Bancorp’s capital structure and financial condition. See the Regulation G Non-GAAP Reconciliation table for a reconciliation of these ratios to U.S. GAAP.  

 (c) Under the banking agencies’ Basel III Final Rule, assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures are calculated according to the standardized approach for risk-weighted assets. The resulting values are added together resulting in the Bancorp’s total risk-weighted assets used in the calculation of the tier I risk-based capital and common equity tier 1 ratios beginning January 1, 2015. Current period regulatory capital ratios are estimated.  

NA: Not applicable.   

“Core fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations,” said Greg D. Carmichael, President and CEO of Fifth Third Bancorp. “Our fee businesses produced stable results despite lower levels of capital markets activity, and our expenses were up less than one percent relative to the third quarter, excluding the contribution we made to our Foundation in support of our communities. We were also pleased with the low charge-off levels at 34 basis points. We view the Fed’s December rate move as a positive first step towards a normalized environment but there is uncertainty around the extent and timing of the future rate decisions.  

“Additionally during the quarter, we have taken important steps towards reducing our direct ownership stake in Vantiv in the best interest of our shareholders while reducing a significant amount of volatility associated with our warrant position. Vantiv continues to perform well and we were happy to participate in their success. In this quarter we executed on all three pieces of our financial interests, namely the TRA, warrants, and direct ownership in a well-planned manner to maximize the returns to our shareholders. After these transactions, we continue to hold a significant ownership stake in the company which we believe will result in healthy returns for our shareholders.  

3  

“We view 2016 as an important transition year tactically and strategically to position our company to achieve operating leverage in a sustainable manner regardless of the rate environment going forward. In 2015 we took significant steps in that direction and we will continue our efforts in 2016. We are working simultaneously on long-term revenue growth as well as expense efficiencies to achieve our goal. We have taken actions to reduce our run-rate expenses and those savings will partially fund the strategic investments and expenses related to our risk and compliance infrastructure which we expect will peak in 2016. Our strategic decisions will continue to result in the re-allocation of our resources to improve profitability with reduced volatility. We are committed to achieving the industry leading level of operational results that our constituents have historically seen from us when it comes to service, efficiency, growth, and returns.”  

Income Statement Highlights  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

4  

Net Interest Income  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net interest income decreased $2 million to $904 million on a fully taxable equivalent basis from the third quarter, primarily driven by the full quarter impact of $2.4 billion of wholesale debt issuances in the third quarter, the $750 million auto securitization completed in November, and commercial loan yield compression, partially offset by residential mortgage loan growth.  

The net interest margin was 2.85 percent, a decrease of 4 bps from the previous quarter, primarily driven by the impact of debt issuances and the auto securitization above, slower prepayments reducing net discount accretion on the investment portfolio, and an increased short-term cash position during the quarter.  

Compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, net interest income increased $16 million and the net interest margin decreased 11 bps. The increase in net interest income was driven by the impact of higher investment securities balances, partially offset by a $22 million decline due to the changes to the Bancorp’s deposit advance product that were effective January 1, 2015. The decline in the net interest margin from the prior year was primarily driven by a 7 basis point impact due to the changes to the deposit advance product and loan repricing.  

Securities  

Average securities and other short-term investments were $31.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $30.1 billion in the previous quarter and $27.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Other short-term investments average balances of $2.3 billion increased $454 million sequentially reflecting higher cash balances held at the Federal Reserve.  

5  

Loans  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average loan and lease balances (excluding loans held-for-sale) increased $221 million sequentially and increased $2.6 billion, or 3 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2014. The year-over-year increase in average loans and leases was driven by increased commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial construction balances. Period end loans and leases (excluding loans held-for-sale) of $92.6 billion decreased $992 million, or 1 percent, sequentially and increased $2.5 billion, or 3 percent, from a year ago.

Period end loans held-for-sale balances of $903 million decreased $91 million sequentially. Period end loans held-for-sale balances decreased $358 million compared with the prior year due to the impact of the transfer of certain residential mortgage loans classified as troubled debt restructurings to held-for-sale in the fourth quarter of 2014.  

6  

Deposits  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Includes commercial customer Eurodollar sweep balances for which the Bancorp pays rates comparable to other commercial deposit accounts.

Average transaction deposits increased $1.0 billion, or 1 percent, from the third quarter of 2015 and increased $3.3 billion, or 4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2014. Sequential performance was primarily driven by higher demand deposit and money market account balances, partially offset by lower interest checking and savings account balances. Year-over-year growth reflected higher demand and money market account balances, partially offset by lower savings, foreign office, and interest checking account balances. Other time deposits were flat sequentially and increased 3 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2014.  

Average commercial transaction deposits increased 2 percent sequentially and increased 5 percent from the previous year. Sequential performance was primarily driven by seasonally higher demand deposit and money market account balances, partially offset by lower interest checking account balances. Year-over-year growth reflected higher demand deposit and money market account balances, partially offset by lower foreign office and interest checking account balances.  

Average consumer transaction deposits were flat sequentially and increased 2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2014.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average wholesale funding of $21.9 billion increased $223 million, or 1 percent, sequentially, and increased $2.4 billion, or 13 percent, compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. The sequential increase was primarily driven by the full quarter’s impact of the issuance of $1.1 billion of 5-year holding company debt and $1.3 billion of 3-year bank-level debt in the third quarter of 2015, a $750 million auto securitization completed in November, and an increase in certificates $100,000 and over. The year-over-year increase in average wholesale funding reflected an increase in federal funds purchased, an increase in long-term debt due to issuances in 2015, as well as an increase in certificates $100,000 and over.  

Noninterest Income  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Noninterest income of $1.1 billion increased $391 million sequentially and increased $451 million compared with prior year results. The sequential and year-over-year comparisons reflect the impacts described below.  

8  

Noninterest Income excluding certain items  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Excluding the items in the table above, noninterest income of $623 million increased $32 million, or 5 percent, from the previous quarter and increased $11 million, or 2 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2014. The sequential growth was primarily due to an annual payment from Vantiv pursuant to the tax receivable agreement of $31 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015. Year-over-year growth was driven by growth in mortgage banking revenue and the annual payment from Vantiv pursuant to the tax receivable agreement recognized in both quarters, partially offset by a decrease in corporate banking revenue.  

Service charges on deposits of $144 million decreased 1 percent from the third quarter of 2015 and increased 1 percent compared with the same quarter last year. The sequential decrease was due to a 3 percent decrease in retail service charges. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2014 was due to a 3 percent increase in commercial service charges.  

Corporate banking revenue of $104 million was flat compared to the third quarter of 2015 and decreased $16 million from the fourth quarter of 2014. The sequential comparison reflects higher lease remarketing fees, partially offset by a decrease in institutional sales revenue. The year-over-year decrease was driven by lower loan syndications revenue, foreign exchange fees, and business lending fees, partially offset by higher lease remarketing and institutional sales revenue.  

Mortgage banking net revenue was $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up $3 million from the third quarter of 2015 and up $13 million from the fourth quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 originations were $1.8 billion, compared with $2.3 billion in the previous quarter and $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 originations resulted in gains of $37 million on mortgages sold, compared with gains of $46 million during the previous quarter and $36 million during the fourth quarter of 2014. Mortgage servicing fees were $53 million this quarter, $54 million in the third quarter of 2015, and $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Mortgage banking net revenue is also affected by net servicing asset valuation adjustments, which include mortgage servicing rights (MSR) amortization and MSR valuation adjustments (including mark-to-market adjustments on free-standing derivatives used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio). These net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 (reflecting MSR amortization of $29 million and MSR valuation adjustments of positive $13 million); negative $29 million in the third quarter of 2015 (MSR amortization of $37 million and MSR valuation adjustments of positive $8 million); and negative $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 (MSR amortization of $32 million and MSR valuation adjustments of negative $2 million). The mortgage servicing asset, net of the valuation reserve, was $785 million at quarter end on a servicing portfolio of $59 billion.  

9  

Investment advisory revenue of $102 million decreased 1 percent from the third quarter of 2015 and increased 2 percent year-over-year. The increase from the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in private client services revenue.  

Card and processing revenue of $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 was flat sequentially and increased 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2014.  

Other noninterest income totaled $602 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with $213 million in the previous quarter and $150 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. As previously described, the results included the adjustments in the table above with the exception of securities gains in all comparable periods. Excluding these items, other noninterest income of $122 million increased approximately $31 million, or 34 percent, from the third quarter of 2015 and increased approximately $9 million, or 8 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2014. The sequential and year-over-year increases were primarily due to payments from Vantiv pursuant to the tax receivable agreement of $31 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $23 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014.  

Net gains on investment securities were $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with an immaterial gain in the previous quarter and $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.  

Noninterest Expense  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Noninterest expense of $963 million increased 2 percent compared with the third quarter of 2015 and increased 5 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. The sequential increase was primarily due to a $10 million contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation and higher net occupancy expense. The year-over-year increase reflected a $10 million contribution to Fifth Third Foundation, higher compensation expense, net occupancy expense, and technology and communications expense, partially offset by lower employee benefits expense.  

10  

Credit Quality  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net charge-offs were $80 million, or 34 bps of average loans and leases on an annualized basis, in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with net charge-offs of $188 million, or 80 bps, in the third quarter of 2015 and $191 million, or 83 bps, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Third quarter 2015 net charge-offs included $102 million related to the restructuring of a student loan backed commercial credit. Excluding this credit in the third quarter of 2015 net charge-offs were down $6 million sequentially. Fourth quarter 2014 net charge-offs included $87 million (38 bps) related to the transfer of residential mortgage loans classified as troubled debt restructurings to held-for-sale.  

Commercial net charge-offs were $34 million, or 24 bps, and were down $108 million sequentially. C&I net charge-offs of $30 million decreased $98 million from the previous quarter primarily due to the student loan backed credit mentioned above, and commercial real estate net charge-offs decreased $11 million from the previous quarter.  

Consumer net charge-offs were $46 million, or 49 bps, and flat sequentially. Net charge-offs on residential mortgage loans in the portfolio were $3 million, flat compared with the previous quarter. Home equity net charge-offs were $9 million, in line with the third quarter of 2015, and net charge-offs in the auto portfolio of $9 million were up $2 million compared with the prior quarter.

The effective tax rate was 30.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with 26.0 percent in the third quarter of 2015 and 25.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014. The sequential and year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the impact of Vantiv-related transactions during the quarter.  

Other  

On October 23, 2015, Fifth Third Bancorp entered into an agreement with Vantiv, Inc. (NYSE: VNTV) under which a portion of its Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”) with Vantiv was terminated and settled in full for consideration of a cash payment in the amount of $48.9 million from Vantiv. Under the agreement, Fifth Third Bancorp sold certain TRA cash flows it expected to receive from 2017 to 2030, totaling an estimated $140 million. This sale did not impact the TRA payment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015 and does not impact the TRA payment expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016. For more detail see the 8-K dated October 28, 2015.  

On December 2, 2015, Vantiv, Inc. conducted a secondary offering of 13.4 million shares of its Class A Common Stock on behalf of Fifth Third. The offering was the culmination of a three-step process that included 1) the partial cancellation of the warrant held by Fifth Third to purchase additional ownership in Vantiv Holding, LLC for a $200 million cash payment; 2) the net exercise of a portion of the remaining warrant for 5.4 million Class C units; and 3) the exchange of these 5.4 million Class C units and 8 million Class B units for the 13.4 million shares of Vantiv, Inc.

The Bancorp had $44, $40, $37 and $21 of government guaranteed loans classified as other receivables as of December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015 and March 31, 2015, respectively.

 (1) Under the banking agencies’ risk-based capital guidelines, assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet exposures are assigned to broad risk categories. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is multiplied by the associated risk-weight of the category. The resulting weighted values are added together, along with the measure for market risk, resulting in the Bancorp’s total risk-weighted assets.  

 (2) The Bancorp became subject to the Basel III Final Rule on January 1, 2015. This codified in the federal banking regulations the risk-based capital ratios the Bancorp is now subject to, as such these ratios are no longer considered Non-GAAP measures.  

 (3) Primarily relates to disallowed intangible assets (other than goodwill and MSRs, net of associated deferred tax liabilities).  

 (4) Primarily relates to higher risk-weighting for MSRs.
