   •   The company achieved record net revenues and diluted EPS, as well as record non-GAAP diluted EPS for both the fourth quarter of 2015 and the full year ended December 31, 2015.  

   •   Fourth quarter 2015 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.89, an increase of 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 GAAP diluted EPS was $0.88.  

   •   Fourth quarter 2015 net revenues1 were $536 million, up 4% year-over-year. On an organic basis, excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and acquisitions, net revenues increased 5%.  

   •   Non-trading segment organic revenue growth was 8% in the fourth quarter of 2015.

New York, N.Y. — Nasdaq, Inc. (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today reported record results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015. Fourth quarter net revenues were $536 million, up 4% from $517 million in the prior year period, driven by a $37 million positive impact from operations, partially offset by a $18 million negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On an organic basis, excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and acquisitions, total fourth quarter net revenues were up 5%, while across the non-trading segments, organic revenue growth was 8%.  

“Over the last several years, we have built a strategic portfolio of businesses that provide a level of resiliency through significant non-transaction revenue streams and scale potential through a strong global trading franchise,” said Bob Greifeld, CEO, Nasdaq. “In the fourth quarter of 2015, market volatility and macro uncertainty have risen at the same time our non-transaction businesses have produced strong organic growth. These factors combined with our inherent operating leverage and disciplined capital deployment have delivered record results and attractive earnings growth to our shareholders.”  

Mr. Greifeld continued, “Our performance is a reflection of a relentless focus on better serving our corporate issuer and investment community customers across a broad offering of products and solutions. Through our commodities platform we are working to create more efficient trading opportunities in key U.S. energy products, our new investor relations platform is working to transform the workflow and productivity of corporate officers, and in the private market we are looking to expand and enhance the equity management and liquidity offerings of private companies. Executing against this wide-ranging set of opportunities advances our clients’ objectives and improves our competitive position.”  

On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter 2015 operating expenses were $285 million, up 2% as compared to the prior year quarter, due to higher organic spend and the impact of the Dorsey Wright Associates, LLC, or DWA, acquisition partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. On a GAAP basis, operating expenses were $290 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $344 million in the prior year quarter.  

“The fourth quarter capped a year of significant cash flow generation, and we continued to apply our return on invested capital based discipline to directing capital deployment,” said Lee Shavel, EVP and CFO, Nasdaq. “I’m pleased we were able to deliver the majority of non-GAAP income back to shareholders, in both the fourth quarter and the full-year, while simultaneously finding opportunities to deploy very meaningful levels of capital towards internal investments like NFX and our blockchain initiatives, as well as on selected acquisitions, such as the DWA index and analytics business, all while remaining within our targeted leverage profile.”  

 1  Represents revenues less transaction-based expenses.  

On a non-GAAP basis, net income attributable to Nasdaq for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $150 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, up $0.08 compared to $0.81 in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis, net income attributable to Nasdaq for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $148 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared with $87 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.  

Please refer to our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income, diluted earnings per share, operating income and operating expenses included in the attached schedules.  

The company repurchased 1.2 million shares, or $67 million of common stock, in the fourth quarter of 2015 at an average price of $56.58. At December 31, 2015, there is $159 million remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program.  

At December 31, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $301 million and total debt of $2,364 million, resulting in net debt of $2,063 million. This compares to net debt of $1,870 million at December 31, 2014.  

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  

Market Services (36% of total net revenues) — Net revenues were $195 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, down $6 million when compared to $201 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $6 million year-over-year decrease reflects a $2 million operational increase, which was more than offset by an $8 million decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates.  

Equity Derivatives (9% of total net revenues) — Net equity derivative trading and clearing revenues were $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, down $5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease in equity derivatives revenue was driven by lower industry trading volumes, lower U.S. market share, and foreign exchange impact.  

Cash Equities (12% of total net revenues) — Net cash equity trading revenues were $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up $7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in cash equity revenue resulted from higher U.S. average net capture, partially offset by lower U.S. market share and foreign exchange impact.  

Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (4% of total net revenues) — Net FICC trading and clearing revenues were $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, down $9 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, due to volume declines in U.S. fixed income and commodities products, and foreign exchange impact.  

Access and Broker Services (11% of total net revenues) — Access and broker services revenues were $61 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up $1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, as organic revenue increases were partially offset by foreign exchange impact.  

Information Services (24% of total net revenues) — Revenues were $127 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up $14 million from the fourth quarter of 2014. The $14 million year-over-year increase reflects an $8 million organic increase and a $9 million increase from the acquisition of DWA, which was partially offset by a $3 million decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates.  

Data Products (18% of total net revenues) — Data products revenues were $98 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up $7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, as increased revenue from proprietary and shared tape revenue plans as well as the inclusion of revenue associated with the DWA acquisition were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.  

Index Licensing and Services (6% of total net revenues) — Index licensing and services revenues were $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up $7 million from the fourth quarter of 2014. The revenue growth was primarily driven by the DWA acquisition, including subsequent growth since closing the transaction.  

Technology Solutions (27% of total net revenues) — Revenues were $146 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up $4 million from the fourth quarter of 2014. The $4 million year-over-year increase reflects a $9 million operational increase, partially offset by a $5 million decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates.  

Corporate Solutions (14% of total net revenues) — Corporate solutions revenues were $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, down $3 million from the fourth quarter of 2014. The corporate solutions revenue decline was primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.  

Market Technology (13% of total net revenues) — Market technology revenues were $71 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up $7 million from the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was driven by organic growth in surveillance products and higher change request revenue, partially offset by changes in foreign exchange rates. New order intake was $116 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, and the order backlog at December 31, 2015 was $788 million, up 10% from the prior year period and an all-time record.  

Listing Services (13% of total net revenues) — Revenues were $68 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up $7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The $7 million year-over-year increase reflects a $9 million operational increase partially offset by a $2 million decrease due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The operational improvement is due to certain pricing actions and increases in the number of both U.S. and European listed companies.  

INITIATING 2016 NON-GAAP EXPENSE GUIDANCE — The company has initiated 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance of $1,110-$1,160 million. Included in this non-GAAP operating expense guidance is an expected $35-$45 million in R&D spending.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) In March 2015, we established a loss reserve of $31 million for litigation arising from the Facebook IPO in May 2012, which was recorded in general, administrative and other expense. The reserve was intended to cover the estimated amount of a settlement of class-action litigation initiated on behalf of investors in Facebook common stock on the date of its IPO. The reserve also covered the cost of re-opening Nasdaq’s voluntary accommodation program to allow any Nasdaq member that did not file for compensation in 2013 to submit a claim during the second quarter of 2015, subject to the conditions and limitations that were applicable to claims filed in 2013. The re-opened accommodation program is now closed. The insurance recovery recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015 represents amounts reimbursed by applicable insurance coverage which offsets the loss reserve that was recorded in March 2015.  

 (2) Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations. These non-cash expenses are fixed and amortized over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset acquired. These expenses generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Management does not consider these expenses for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources. Therefore, such expenses are shown as a non-GAAP adjustment.  

 (3) During the first quarter of 2015, we performed a comprehensive review of our processes, businesses and systems in a company-wide effort to improve performance, cut costs, and reduce spending. In the first quarter of 2015, we also decided to change our company name from The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc., to Nasdaq, Inc., which became effective in the third quarter of 2015. We currently estimate that we will recognize net pre-tax restructuring charges of $190 million, consisting of the rebranding of our trade name, severance, asset impairments, facility-related and other costs. We recognized restructuring charges of $12 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015, $8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, $2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and $150 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 for a total of $172 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The remaining amount will be recognized through June 2016. Restructuring charges are recorded on restructuring plans that have been committed to by management and are, in part, based upon management’s best estimates of future events. Changes to the estimates may require future adjustments to the restructuring liabilities.  

 (4) For the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 and the three months ended September 30, 2015, merger and strategic initiatives expense primarily related to certain strategic initiatives and our acquisition of Dorsey, Wright & Associates, LLC. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2014, merger and strategic initiatives expense primarily related to our acquisition of the Investor Relations, Public Relations and Multimedia Solutions businesses of Thomson Reuters, or the TR Corporate businesses, and eSpeed and a charge of $23 million related to the reversal of a receivable under a tax sharing agreement with an unrelated party. The $23 million charge is offset by a tax benefit as described in note 8 below.  

 (5) For the three months and year ended December 31, 2014, asset impairment charges of $49 million related to certain acquired intangible assets associated with customer relationships ($38 million) and certain technology assets ($11 million).  

 (6) We record our investment in The Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC, as an equity method investment. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our share of earnings or losses of an equity method investee based on our ownership percentage. As a result of a new capital plan implemented by OCC, we were not able to determine what our share of OCC’s income was for the year ended December 31, 2014 until the first quarter of 2015, when OCC financial statements were made available to us. Therefore, we recorded other income of $13 million in the first quarter of 2015 relating to our share of OCC’s income for the year ended December 31, 2014.  

 (7) We previously recorded receivables for expected value added tax, or VAT, refunds based on an approach that had been accepted by the tax authorities in prior years. The tax authorities have since challenged our approach, and the revised position of the tax authorities was upheld in court during the first quarter of 2015. As a result, in the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a charge of $12 million for previously recorded receivables based on the court decision.  

 (8) For the three months and year ended December 31, 2014, amount includes $23 million associated with the recognition of a previously unrecognized tax benefit. This amount is offset by the reversal of the receivable described in note 4 above.
