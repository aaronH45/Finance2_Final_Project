  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Proposal received the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shareholders entitled to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting and therefore passed. Any abstentions, “blank votes” and invalid votes were counted for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, but were not considered to be votes cast and therefore had no effect on the vote on the Proposal. Any “broker non-votes” were not treated as shares present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum and were not considered to be votes cast and therefore had no effect on the vote on the Proposal.  

SIGNATURE  

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
