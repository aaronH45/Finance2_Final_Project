Article III, Section 3.16 has been added and Sections 3.15 and 2.12 have been modified in the Amended By-Laws to permit an eligible stockholder, or an eligible group of 20 or fewer stockholders, owning at least 3% of the Company’s outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials director nominees constituting up to 20% of the number of directors currently serving on the Board, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the Amended By-Laws. Proxy access will first be available to stockholders in connection with the Company’s 2017 annual meeting. 

The Board of Directors of the Company also approved the following additional amendments to the Company’s By-Laws:

•Article III, Section 3.2 was amended to provide that the number of directors of the Company shall be not less than nine and not more than thirteen. The By-Laws previously provided that the number of directors of the Company shall be not less than ten and not more than thirteen.

•Article III, Section 3.3 of the By-Laws was amended to eliminate the requirement that a regular meeting of the Board of Directors be held immediately after the annual meeting of stockholders. 

The above description of the Amended By-Laws is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Company’s Amended By-Laws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.2 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
