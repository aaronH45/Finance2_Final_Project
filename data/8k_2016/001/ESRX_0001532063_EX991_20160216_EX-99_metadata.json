        " (7) Provision for income taxes includes discrete tax benefits of $92.2 million and $79.2 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net discrete tax benefits of $68.3 million and $113.9 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2014. The 2015 net discrete tax benefits relate primarily to changes in our unrecognized tax benefits as a result of various state audit settlements and lapses in statutes of limitations. The 2014 net discrete tax benefits relate primarily to a change in estimate resulting in the recognition of tax benefits for a permanent deduction related to domestic production activities, offset by charges related to interest on and changes in our unrecognized tax benefits."
