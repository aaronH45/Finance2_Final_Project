 Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure    

American Express Company (the “Company”) is hereby furnishing below delinquency and write-off statistics for its U.S. Card Services (“USCS”) operating segment’s Card Member loans held for investment for the months ended November 30 and December 31, 2015 and January 31, 2016. Effective December 1, 2015, the Company reclassified the Card Member loans related to its cobrand partnerships with Costco Wholesale Corporation in the U.S. and JetBlue Airways Corporation to Card Member loans held for sale ("HFS") on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and thus such loans are not reflected in the table below for December 2015 or January 2016.

U.S. Card Services 

Delinquency and Write-off Rate Statistics 

As of and for the months ended November 30 and December 31, 2015 and January 31, 2016 

(Billions, except percentages) [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)   Net write-off rate based on principal only (i.e., excluding interest and /or fees).     

  (b)   Total reported Card Member loans were $60.4 billion and $62.6 billion as of January 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Card Member loans related to Costco and JetBlue, now classified as HFS, were $13.9 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, as of January 31, 2015 and $14.8 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2014.     

The statistics presented above provide information that is additional to the data reported by the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the “Lending Trust”) in its monthly Form 10-D report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Card Member loans that have been securitized through the Lending Trust do not possess identical characteristics with those of the USCS loans held for investment, which reflect the aggregate of securitized and non-securitized loans and exclude loans held for sale. Thus, the reported credit performance of the Lending Trust may, on a month-to-month basis, be better or worse than the credit performance of the USCS loans held for investment. Reported differences may arise as a result of, among other things, differences in the mix and vintage of loans between the Lending Trust and the USCS loans held for investment (including, among other things, the larger proportion of small business loans in the non-securitized portion of the USCS loans held for investment), the performance of Card Member loans held for sale that have been securitized through the Lending Trust, but which are not included in the statistics of the USCS loans held for investment, the use of end-of-period principal loan balances to calculate write-off statistics in the Lending Trust compared to the use of average loan balances over the reporting period used in the statistics of the USCS loans held for investment, as well as other mechanics of the calculation for the lending trust net write-off rate, which is impacted by any additions to the securitization trust within a particular period. 

Set forth below is certain information regarding the credit performance of the Lending Trust for its three most recent monthly reporting periods, as reported in its Form 10-D report filed with respect to each such period.
