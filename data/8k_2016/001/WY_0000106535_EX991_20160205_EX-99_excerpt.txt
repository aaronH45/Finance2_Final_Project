Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings of $121 million, or 24 cents per diluted share. This compares with net earnings from continuing operations before special items of $145 million, or 27 cents per diluted share for the same period last year.

For the full year 2015, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings attributable to common shareholders of $462 million, or 89 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $7.1 billion. This compares with net earnings of $1.8 billion, or $3.18 per diluted share, on net sales from continuing operations of $7.4 billion for the same period last year. 2014 results included after-tax earnings of $998 million from discontinued operations, related to the divested Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company.

Full year 2015 includes net after-tax charges of $71 million from special items. Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings of $533 million, or $1.04 per diluted share. This compares with net earnings from continuing operations before special items of $700 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, for the full year 2014.

“2015 was a milestone year for Weyerhaeuser, as we announced a transformational merger that will create the world’s premier timber, land and forest products company,” said Doyle R. Simons, president and chief executive officer. “At the same time, we maintained our relentless focus on improving our relative performance and delivered on our 2015 operational excellence targets. Finally, we fulfilled our commitment to return cash to shareholders through a 7 percent dividend increase and the repurchase of over $500 million of common shares. Looking forward to 2016, completion of our merger with Plum Creek, the strategic review of our Cellulose Fibers business, and our continued focus on operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation will position us to drive value for our shareholders.”

TIMBERLANDS 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

4Q 2015 Performance - In the West, fee harvest volumes increased and average log sales realizations improved. In the South, fee harvest volumes decreased as a result of wet weather and average log sales realizations declined due to mix, mostly offset by lower costs. Earnings from the disposition of non-strategic timberlands increased by $6 million compared with the third quarter.

1Q 2016 Outlook - Weyerhaeuser expects comparable earnings from the Timberlands segment in the first quarter. In the West, the company expects higher log sales volumes and average realizations. In the South, the company anticipates seasonally lower fee harvest volumes and slightly decreased average log sales realizations due to mix. The company expects lower earnings from the disposition of nonstrategic timberlands in first quarter 2016 compared with fourth quarter 2015.

WOOD PRODUCTS 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

4Q 2015 Performance - Increased average sales realizations for oriented strand board were more than offset by reduced average lumber sales realizations and seasonally lower sales volumes across all product lines. Operating rates decreased, primarily due to downtime for planned maintenance in engineered wood products and oriented strand board and installation of capital projects in lumber.

Special items for the fourth quarter include restructuring charges related to the closure of four distribution centers.

1Q 2016 Outlook - Weyerhaeuser expects higher earnings from the Wood Products segment in the first quarter. The company expects moderately higher average sales realizations for lumber and increased production volumes across all product lines.

CELLULOSE FIBERS 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

4Q 2015 Performance - Lower average price realizations for pulp and increased maintenance costs due to additional scheduled outage days compared to the third quarter were partially offset by increased pulp sales volumes.

Special items for the fourth quarter include a noncash charge for Weyerhaeuser's share of an asset impairment recorded by an equity affiliate focused on newsprint and publication papers.

1Q 2016 Outlook - Weyerhaeuser expects significantly lower earnings from the Cellulose Fibers segment in the first quarter. The company anticipates decreased average sales realizations for pulp, seasonally lower pulp sales volumes, and additional maintenance expense due to a scheduled outage at the company's liquid packaging board facility.
