"During 2015, we achieved an investment grade credit rating from each of S&P and Fitch Ratings. Further, in 2015, we redeployed capital from the divestiture of our Australian business to further grow and strengthen our leadership position in wireless infrastructure in the U.S., which we believe is the most attractive market for wireless investment. We believe the quality of our U.S.-focused portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers and 16,000 miles of fiber supporting small cell deployments, together with the strength of our balance sheet, illustrates the importance we place on generating a high-quality, growing dividend stream and attractive total returns for our shareholders."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Calculations

This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA, Funds from Operations, Adjusted Funds from Operations, Organic Site Rental Revenues, and Site Rental Revenues, as Adjusted, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")). Each of the amounts included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO, Organic Site Rental Revenues, and Site Rental Revenues, as Adjusted, are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of: (1) sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP and (2) our adjustment to the income tax provision in calculations of AFFO for periods prior to our REIT conversion. 

Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO, Organic Site Rental Revenues and Site Rental Revenues, as Adjusted, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector or those reported by other REITs. Our FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to those reported in accordance with National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, including with respect to the impact of income taxes for periods prior to our REIT conversion.

Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, AFFO, Organic Site Rental Revenues and Site Rental Revenues, as Adjusted, are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. 

Adjusted EBITDA. Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on retirement of long-term obligations, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, gains (losses) on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense.

Funds from Operations ("FFO"). Crown Castle defines Funds from Operations as net income plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset write-down charges, less noncontrolling interest and cash paid for preferred stock dividends, and is a measure of funds from operations attributable to CCIC common stockholders. 

FFO per share. Crown Castle defines FFO per share as FFO divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 

Adjusted Funds from Operations ("AFFO"). Crown Castle defines Adjusted Funds from Operations as FFO before straight-line revenue, straight-line expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash portion of tax provision, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of non-cash interest expense, other (income) expense, gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, acquisition and integration costs, and adjustments for noncontrolling interests, and less capital improvement capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures.

AFFO per share. Crown Castle defines AFFO per share as AFFO divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 

Site Rental Revenues, as Adjusted. Crown Castle defines Site Rental Revenues, as Adjusted, as site rental revenues, as reported, less straight-line revenues. 

Organic Site Rental Revenues. Crown Castle defines Organic Site Rental Revenues as site rental revenues, as reported, less straight-line revenues, the impact of tower acquisitions and construction, foreign currency adjustments and certain non recurring items.

Sustaining capital expenditures. Crown Castle defines sustaining capital expenditures as either (1) corporate related capital improvements, such as buildings, information technology equipment and office equipment or (2) capital improvements to tower sites that enable our customers' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the tower.

The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains forward-looking statements and information that are based on our management's current expectations. Such statements include our Outlook and plans, projections, and estimates regarding (1) potential benefits, returns and shareholder value which may be derived from our business, assets, investments, dividends and acquisitions, including on a long-term basis, (2) our strategy and strategic position and strength of our business, (3) wireless consumer demand, (4) demand for our wireless infrastructure and services, (5) the executive management succession plan, (6) carrier network investments and upgrades, and the benefits which may be derived therefrom, (7) our growth and long-term prospects, (8) our dividends, including our dividend plans, the amount and growth of our dividends, the potential benefits therefrom and the tax characterization thereof, (9) the U.S. wireless market, (10) leasing activity, including the impact of such leasing activity on our results and Outlook, (11) the Sunesys acquisition, including potential benefits and impact therefrom and growth related thereto, (12) our investments, including in small cells, and the potential benefits therefrom, (13) non-renewal of leases and decommissioning of networks, including timing, the impact thereof and decommissioning fees, (14) capital expenditures, including sustaining capital expenditures, (15) timing items, (16) straight-line adjustments, (17) tower acquisitions and builds, (18) expenses, including general and administrative expense, (19) site rental revenues and Site Rental Revenues, as Adjusted, (20) site rental cost of operations, (21) site rental gross margin and network services gross margin, (22) Adjusted EBITDA, (23) interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (24) FFO, including on a per share basis, (25) AFFO, including on a per share basis, (26) Organic Site Rental Revenues and Organic Site Rental Revenue growth, (27) net income (loss), (28) our common shares outstanding, including on a diluted basis, and (29) the utility of certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions prevailing market conditions and the following:

•Our business depends on the demand for wireless communications and wireless infrastructure, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in carrier network investment may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for new tenant additions and network services).

•A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure and network services.

•Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments and 4.50% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated. 

•We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.

•Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

•As a result of competition in our industry, including from some competitors with significantly more resources or less debt than we have, we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable rental rates on our new or renewing customer contracts.

•The business model for our small cell operations contains differences from our traditional site rental business, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate that business model or identify or manage those operational risks, such operations may produce results that are less than anticipated.

•New technologies may significantly reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure and negatively impact our revenues.

•New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected.

•If we fail to retain rights to our wireless infrastructure, including the land under our sites, our business may be adversely affected.

•Our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.

•The expansion and development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings, or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results.

•If we fail to comply with laws and regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.

•If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our wireless infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.

The Foundation for a Wireless World.

•Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.

•Future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.

•Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the US Internal Revenue Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.

•Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.

•If we fail to pay scheduled dividends on the 4.50% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in cash, common stock or any combination of cash and common stock, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our status as a REIT.

•We have limited experience operating as a REIT. Our failure to successfully operate as a REIT may adversely affect our financial condition, cash flow, the per share trading price of our common stock, or our ability to satisfy debt service obligations.

•REIT ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.

Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is included in our filings with the SEC. As used in this release, the term "including," and any variation thereof, means "including without limitation."
