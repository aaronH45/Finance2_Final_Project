Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

On January 19, 2016, Tyco International plc (“Tyco International”) announced it had entered into an agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to resolve certain disputes currently before the U.S. Tax Court. The disputes involve IRS audits of Tyco International for years in which companies that are now subsidiaries of Mallinckrodt plc (the “Company”) were subsidiaries of Tyco International. The Company is not a participant in the tax sharing agreement between Medtronic plc (as successor to Covidien plc), Tyco International and TE Connectivity and will not share in or be responsible for any payments to be made under the terms of the tentative resolution. The Company believes that it is adequately reserved for taxes related to periods prior to the legal separation of the Company from Covidien plc and intends to adjust its reserves when the tentative resolution is finalized. The Company does not expect that this development will change its fiscal year 2016 non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance.

The information furnished pursuant to Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is being furnished and shall not be deemed “filed” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be incorporated by reference into any filings by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or under the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. The furnishing of information pursuant to this Item 7.01 will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information in this Current Report on Form 8-K that is required to be disclosed solely by Regulation FD.
