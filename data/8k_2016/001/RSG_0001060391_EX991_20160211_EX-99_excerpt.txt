PHOENIX (Feb. 11, 2016) - Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) today reported net income of $172.3 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2015, versus $50.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the comparable 2014 period. Excluding certain benefits and expenses, on an adjusted basis, net income for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2015, was $175.0 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, versus $178.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the comparable 2014 period.

For the year ended Dec. 31, 2015, net income was $749.9 million, or $2.13 per diluted share, versus $547.6 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, for the comparable 2014 period.

“I am pleased to report another year of profitable growth. We finished the year strong and delivered results that exceeded our EPS and free cash flow guidance,” said Donald W. Slager, president and chief executive officer. “Our performance reflects the positive contribution our multi-year initiatives are having on the business and the successful execution of our strategy. During the course of 2015, the business generated consistent earnings and free cash flow growth while increasing cash returns to shareholders. Importantly, we were able to achieve this while maintaining our strong capital structure.”

Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Highlights:

*Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.50 per share.

*Full year adjusted diluted EPS was $2.06 and adjusted free cash flow was $813 million; both exceeded our full year guidance primarily due to tax extenders that were signed into law at the end of the year.

*Revenue growth during the fourth quarter from average yield was 2.2 percent and volumes increased 0.9 percent. This continues to reflect our ability to grow price and volume simultaneously.

*Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.2 percent and full year margin was 28.1 percent. Full year margin improvement of 10 basis points reflects expansion in our solid waste business primarily from lower fuel costs and pricing in excess of cost inflation, partially offset by lower recycling commodity prices and the impact of recent acquisitions. 

*Delivered total shareholder return of 12.4 percent during 2015, which exceeded the S&P 500 average by over 8 times.

*Returned $808 million total cash to our shareholders during 2015 through dividends and share repurchases, which represents a cash yield of approximately 5.6 percent.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year Operational Highlights:

*During the fourth quarter we invested $52 million in tuck-in acquisitions, and $193 million for the full year. The transactions completed in 2015 represent annual revenue of approximately $143 million at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of 4.3 times.

*During 2015 we advanced our revenue enhancing initiatives that are focused on creating a better customer experience and further differentiating our service offerings. For example: 

•We now have over 1.2 million customers active and enrolled in our MyResourceTM customer portal and mobile app. These tools significantly enhance customer interaction and connectivity;

•We launched click-to-buy capabilities in approximately 50% of our markets with residential subscription business. In these markets, click-to-buy represents approximately 15% of all new subscription sales;

•We fully implemented our Capture cloud-based pricing tool, which is integrated with our CRM software; 

•We trained our sales force on Priority Based Selling, which is designed to identify and attract customers that value our higher quality service offerings; and 

•We have over 500 contracts with approximately $250 million in annual revenue that now use a waste-related index for the annual price adjustment.

*We continued to make progress on our fleet-based initiatives designed to improve productivity and lower costs. Currently: 

•16 percent of our fleet operates on natural gas;

•72 percent of our residential fleet is automated; and

•78 percent of our fleet is certified under our standardized maintenance program.

You should read the following information in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 (when filed). All amounts below are in millions and as a percentage of our revenue, except per share data.

REVENUE

The following table reflects our total revenue by line of business for the three months and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following table reflects changes in components of our revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, for the three months and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average yield is defined as revenue growth from the change in average price per unit of service, expressed as a percentage. Core price is defined as price increases to our customers and fees, excluding fuel recovery, net of price decreases to retain customers. We also measure changes in average yield and core price as a percentage of related-business revenue, defined as total revenue excluding recycled commodities and fuel recovery fees, to determine the effectiveness of our pricing strategies. Average yield as a percentage of related-business revenue was 2.4% and 2.6% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, and 1.8% and

1.5% for the same periods in 2014, respectively. Core price as a percentage of related-business revenue was 3.7% and 4.0% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, and 3.5% and 3.4% for the same periods in 2014, respectively. 

COST OF OPERATIONS

The following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the three months and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:

RECONCILIATION OF CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURES

EBITDA

The following table calculates EBITDA, which is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), for the three months and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We believe that presenting EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides important information concerning our operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash and other costs. EBITDA demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy, which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends, repurchasing our common stock, and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization. This measure has limitations. Although depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion are considered operating costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they represent the allocation of non-cash costs generally associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior years. Our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Adjusted Earnings

Reported diluted earnings per share were $0.49 and $2.13 for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 versus $0.14 and $1.53 for the comparable 2014 periods. During the three months and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a number of charges, other expenses and benefits that impacted our EBITDA, pre-tax income, net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. (net income – Republic) and diluted earnings per share. These items primarily consist of the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

10

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) The aggregate impact of the noted items to adjusted diluted earnings per share totals to $0.01 for the year ended December 31, 2014.

We believe that presenting adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income - Republic, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. We have incurred comparable charges and costs and have recorded similar recoveries in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. In the case of the Bridgeton remediation charges and insurance recovery, we are adjusting such amounts due to their significant effect on our operating results; however, in the ordinary course of our business, we often incur remediation charges and recoveries that we do not adjust from our operating results. Our definition of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted net income - Republic, and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 

Adjusted Free Cash Flow

The following table calculates our adjusted free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We believe that presenting adjusted free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after certain payments. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy and is a key metric we use to determine compensation. The presentation of adjusted free cash flow has material limitations. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary payments because it excludes certain payments that are required or to which we have committed, such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the adjusted free cash flow presented above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected

on our consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period follows for the three months and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, accounts receivable were $962.9 million and $930.4 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $46.7 million and $38.9 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of 38, or 26 days net of deferred revenue, compared to 38, or 25 days net of deferred revenue, respectively.

CASH DIVIDENDS

In October 2015, we paid a cash dividend of $104.3 million to shareholders of record as of October 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we recorded a dividend payable of $103.7 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 4, 2016, which was paid on January 15, 2016. 

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

During the three months ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 2.6 million shares of our stock for $111.5 million at a weighted average cost per share of $43.46. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, 0.1 million repurchased shares were pending settlement and $3.7 million were unpaid and included within other liabilities.

As of December 31, 2015, we had 345.6 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 

RECONCILIATION OF 2016 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE 

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share

The following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ending December 31, 2016 compared to the actual adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes restructuring charges, Bridgeton insurance recovery, and withdrawal costs - Other Funds, provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use this measure, and believe investors will find it helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. We have incurred comparable charges and costs and have recorded similar recoveries in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow

Our anticipated adjusted free cash flow for the year ending December 31, 2016, and our actual adjusted free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are not measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are calculated as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period is as follows:

It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy and is a key metric we use to determine compensation. The presentation of adjusted free cash flow has material limitations.
