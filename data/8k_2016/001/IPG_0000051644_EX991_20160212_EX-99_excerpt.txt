Net Results[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Excluding the impact of the loss on sales of businesses recorded during the third and fourth quarters of 2015, diluted earnings per share was $1.21 in 2015. Excluding the impact of the net valuation allowance reversal of $67.6 million on deferred tax assets in Continental Europe in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the charge for early extinguishment of the 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2014 (the "6.25% Notes") in the second quarter of 2014, diluted earnings per share was $0.98 in 2014.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

“From every perspective, 2015 was a very successful year, with notable accomplishments in the marketplace and strong financial results. Across the group, the quality of our people and our offerings is at its highest level in well over a decade. The key drivers of our industry-leading organic revenue performance have been talent acquisition and development, particularly in creative and strategic roles, our ‘open architecture’ model of integrating services, as well as the deep digital expertise we have embedded into our agencies. Our commitment to developing new skills, products and technology-enabled capabilities has allowed us to stay highly relevant in a very dynamic industry,” commented Michael Roth, Chairman and CEO of IPG. “We continue to convert growth to profit at a high level, which led to operating margin improvement of 100 basis points in 2015. We also remain committed to our robust capital return programs, as evident in the actions our Board has announced today to increase the dividend and authorization for share repurchase. These will continue to be drivers of value creation. Looking forward, the tone of our business is good and we are positioned for continued growth.

Increased macro uncertainty and market volatility are factors that require us to approach 2016 with an appropriate degree of caution. We are therefore targeting organic growth of 3% - 4% and an additional 50 basis points or more of margin improvement, which would bring us to operating margin performance of 12.0% or greater. Coupled with strong capital returns, we are confident that achieving these targets will allow us to build on our strong track record of enhancing shareholder value,” Mr. Roth concluded.
