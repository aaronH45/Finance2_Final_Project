  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

NEW YORK, NY, February 26, 2016 – Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE: FL), the New York-based specialty athletic retailer, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended January 30, 2016. 

Fourth Quarter Results 

The Company reported net income of $158 million for the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2016. This equates to earnings of $1.14 per share, an increase of 13 percent over earnings per share of $1.01 for the 13-week period ended January 31, 2015. 

Fourth quarter comparable-store sales increased 7.9 percent. Total fourth quarter sales increased 5.0 percent, to $2,007 million this year, compared with sales of $1,911 million in 2014. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, total sales for the fourth quarter increased 8.8 percent. 

“In 2015, we continued to deliver outstanding financial performance across channels, geographies, banners, and product categories,” said Richard Johnson, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We began the year by introducing a revised strategic framework and priorities, as well as elevated long-term financial objectives. I could not be more proud of the progress the team has made developing leadership positions in so many areas of our business. 

“Building on those leadership positions, we believe we can continue to elevate our financial performance in 2016 by generating a mid-single digit comparable sales gain and another double digit percentage increase in earnings per share.” 

Non-GAAP Adjustments 

During the fourth quarter of 2015 the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $5 million to reflect the impairment of certain Runners Point Group assets. During the same quarter a year ago, the Company realized a gain from the sale of a property and a loss from the writedown of a trade name. On a non-GAAP basis excluding these one-time items, the Company earned $1.16 per share, a 16 percent increase over the comparable 13-week non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.00 in 2014. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the tables below. 

Fiscal Year Results 

For fiscal year 2015, the Company reported net income of $541 million, or $3.84 per share, compared to net income of $520 million, or $3.56 per share, in 2014. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings were $4.29 per share in 2015, an increase of 20 percent over the $3.58 per share earned on a comparable basis in 2014. In 2015 the Company generated its sixth consecutive double-digit percentage increase in annual earnings per share and its fifth consecutive year of record earnings as Foot Locker, Inc.
