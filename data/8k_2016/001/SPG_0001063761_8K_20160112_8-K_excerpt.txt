ITEM 4.02(a) Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review. 

On January 12, 2016, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Simon Property Group, Inc. (the “Company”), acting on the recommendation of management, and after consultation with Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, concluded that the Company should amend and restate its previously issued interim consolidated financial statements contained in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015 solely to reflect the recognition of the non-cash gain described in Item 8.01 below. The Company has filed amended Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A for the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015 solely to reflect the recognition of the non-cash gain (the “Amended 2015 Form 10-Q/As”). Changes relating to the recognition of the non-cash gain are the only changes reflected in the Amended 2015 Form 10-Q/As, and the non-cash gain does not affect previously reported cash flows generated from operating activities or the Company’s non-GAAP measures (funds from operations, net operating income and comparable property net operating income) for any period. See Item 8.01 below. 

ITEM 8.01 Other Events. 

During the preparation of the financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company’s year end reporting procedures and controls identified that a non-cash gain of $206.9 million, solely related to the Company’s equity method investment in Klépierre SA (“Klépierre”) and Klépierre’s acquisition of Corio N.V. (“Corio”) in January, 2015 needed to be recorded in the first quarter of 2015. Klépierre issued 114 million additional shares of its common stock in connection with its acquisition of Corio which effectively reduced the Company’s percentage ownership interest in Klépierre common shares from 28.9% to 18.3% during the quarterly period ending March 2015. As a result of Klépierre’s issuance of additional shares and the reduction in the Company’s ownership interest, the Company is required to recognize a gain (or loss) based on the difference in Klépierre’s issue price per share as compared to the Company’s carrying value per Klépierre share. This non-cash gain is recognized in the Company’s net income in the period the change of its ownership interest occurred. The Company sold no shares of Klépierre in 2015 in connection with Klépierre’s Corio acquisition or otherwise. 

Additionally, on May 11, 2015, the Company purchased an additional 6.3 million shares of Klépierre increasing its ownership from 18.3% to 20.3%. 

Changes relating to the recognition of the $206.9 million non-cash gain are the only changes reflected in the Amended 2015 Form 10-Q/As, and the non-cash gain does not affect previously reported cash flows generated from operating activities or the Company’s non-GAAP measures (funds from operations, net operating income and comparable property net operating income) for any period. 

The Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheets and unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015 were amended and restated in the Amended 2015 Form 10-Q/As to reflect the recognition of the $206.9 million non-cash gain. The following tables summarize the effects of the amendments and restatements:
