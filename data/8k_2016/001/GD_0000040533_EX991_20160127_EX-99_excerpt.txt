PRELIMINARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION - (UNAUDITED)

DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS

(a)Prior period information has been restated to reflect the reclassification of debt issuance costs from other assets to debt in accordance with ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.

(b)Return on equity is calculated by dividing earnings from continuing operations for the latest 12-month period by our average equity during that period.

(c)Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity as of the end of the period.

(d)Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity as of the end of the period.

(e)Book value per share is calculated as total equity divided by total outstanding shares as of the end of the period.

(f)Includes independent research and development and Aerospace product-development costs.

(g)We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to free cash flow from operations is net cash provided by operating activities.

(h)We believe return on invested capital (ROIC) is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders' equity for the year. ROIC excludes accumulated other comprehensive loss, goodwill impairments and non-economic accounting changes as they are not reflective of our operating performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to net operating profit after taxes is earnings from continuing operations. After-tax interest and amortization expense is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35 percent.

*The estimated potential contract value represents management's estimate of our future contract value under unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts, including options to purchase new aircraft and long-term agreements with fleet customers, as applicable. Because the value in the unfunded IDIQ arrangements is subject to the customer's future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of orders, we recognize these contracts in backlog only when they are funded. Unexercised options are recognized in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order.
