The Procter & Gamble Company Regulation G Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 

In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures used in the earnings call and associated slides and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends and results and provide a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to more fully understand our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. 

The measures provided are as follows: 

  1.   Organic Sales Growth—page 3     

  2.   Core EPS and Currency-Neutral Core EPS—pages 4-5     

  3.   Core Operating Profit Margin—page 6     

  4.   Core Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SG&A) as a Percentage of Net Sales—page 6     

  5.   Core Gross Margin—page 6     

  6.   Core Effective Tax Rate—page 6     

  7.   Adjusted Free Cash Flow—page 7     

  8.   Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity—page 7     

The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: 

  •   charges for incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings,     

  •   charge in 2015 related to the change in accounting for our Venezuelan subsidiaries     

  •   charges for European legal matters, and     

  •   charges for balance sheet impacts from the devaluation of the foreign currency exchange rate in Venezuela prior to deconsolidation.     

We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results. 

Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of the Venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. 

Core EPS and currency-neutral Core EPS: Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Currency-neutral Core EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. The tables below provide a reconciliation of revised diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS and of Core EPS to currency-neutral Core EPS. 

Core operating profit margin: This is a measure of the Company's operating margin adjusted for items as indicated. 

Core selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of sales: This is a measure of the Company's SG&A as a percentage of sales adjusted for items as indicated. 

Core gross margin: This is a measure of the Company's gross margin adjusted for items as indicated. 

Core tax rate: This is a measure of the Company's tax rate on continuing operations adjusted for items as indicated. 

Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending excluding tax payments for the Pet divestiture. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. 

Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment and Venezuela charges. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual free cash flow at or above 90 percent of net earnings.
