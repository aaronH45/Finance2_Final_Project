[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Record marketing segment performance for the year with operating income of $899 million

•Estimated improvements of approximately $670 million in 2015[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

SAN ANTONIO - February 1, 2016 - Tesoro Corporation (NYSE:TSO) today reported fourth quarter 2015 net earnings of $54 million, or $0.45 per diluted share versus $145 million or $1.13 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of last year. These results include a pre-tax charge of $276 million related to a lower of cost or market (LCM) adjustment. This adjustment is a result of the significant decline in crude oil and product prices relative to our LIFO inventory. Excluding this LCM charge, adjusted earnings were $221 million, or $1.83 per diluted share. Reported results in the quarter included $24 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, from an environmental accrual in our logistics business, $30 million, or $0.15 per diluted share from the impact of purchasing additional RINs to comply with the final requirements from the EPA which were increased from the proposed levels for the Renewable Fuel Standard program, and $15 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, of asset impairments due to the current weak crude oil price environment. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Full year 2015 net earnings of $1.5 billion or $12.36 per diluted share were up 83% over 2014 net earnings of $843 million or $6.44 per diluted share.

“2015 was a record year for EBITDA, net income and earnings per share, despite a challenging fourth quarter” said Greg Goff, Chairman and CEO. “We continued to strengthen our business as we estimate that we delivered approximately $670 million of improvements in 2015. We generated solid free cash flow and returned over $870 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Going into 2016, we remain focused on driving strong operating performance and executing on our business plans in a challenging business environment.”

The refining segment’s operating income was $4 million for the quarter, compared to $90 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding the lower of cost or market adjustment this quarter, the refining segment’s operating income was $280 million. The segment’s performance in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by unplanned downtime of both fluid catalytic crackers at our Los Angeles refinery. 

The Tesoro Index was $15.60/bbl for the fourth quarter of 2015 with a realized gross refining margin of $12.76/bbl or 82% of the Tesoro Index. Capture rates in the quarter were impacted by a combination of weaker crude oil differentials and the operational interruption at the Los Angeles refinery. 

Total refinery throughput for the quarter was 807 thousand barrels per day, or 95% utilization. Direct manufacturing costs in the fourth quarter were $5.62 per barrel up $0.78 per barrel from the third quarter. This increase was primarily due to unplanned repairs and maintenance during the quarter.

The logistics segment’s operating income was $104 million in the fourth quarter compared to $32 million a year ago. This growth was primarily driven by contributions from the Rockies natural gas business. Fourth quarter results include a charge of $24 million for an environmental accrual related to the 2013 crude oil pipeline release at Tioga, North Dakota.

The marketing segment’s operating income was $175 million, down from $261 million in the fourth quarter of last year, largely attributable to lower comparable marketing margins. Same store fuel sales during the quarter were higher by 1% versus fourth quarter last year, driven by strong demand.

Corporate and unallocated costs for the quarter were $97 million. The effective tax rate was 36.6% in the fourth quarter. 

Capital Spending and Liquidity

Capital spending for the fourth quarter 2015 was $191 million for Tesoro and $59 million for Tesoro Logistics (TLLP). Capital spending for the full year 2015 was $710 million for Tesoro and $296 million for TLLP. 

Turnaround expenditures for the fourth quarter were $70 million. Turnaround expenditures for the full year were $290 million. 

Tesoro ended the fourth quarter with $942 million in cash and $2.5 billion of availability on the revolving credit facility. There are currently no borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Excluding TLLP debt and equity, total debt was $1.3 billion or 19% of total capitalization at the end of the fourth quarter 2015. On a consolidated basis, total outstanding debt, net of unamortized issuance costs, was $4.1 billion or 34% of total capitalization. TLLP ended the quarter with $305 million in borrowings under its separate revolving credit facility.

Returning Cash to Shareholders

During the fourth quarter, Tesoro returned $209 million to shareholders through the purchase of nearly 1.4 million shares for $150 million and its regular quarterly dividend of $59 million. For the full year, Tesoro returned $872 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

Tesoro has $1.4 billion remaining under its approved share repurchase programs. The company expects to continue to repurchase shares in 2016.

Tesoro Corporation today also announced that the board of directors has approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share payable on March 15, 2016, to all holders of record as of February 29, 2016.

Strategic Update

For 2015, we estimate that we delivered approximately $670 million towards our ongoing focus to improve gross margin and manage our costs to drive improvement in operating income. This includes about $350 million related to West Coast improvements and capturing margin improvements. We delivered approximately $320 million from growing our logistics operations, which includes contributions from the Rockies natural gas business. 

Tesoro expects to deliver between $400 and $500 million of improvements in 2016 through driving operational improvements and growth in the Company’s logistics and marketing business segments.

Tesoro recently closed the acquisition of Great Northern Midstream LLC, a crude oil logistics provider which owns and operates a high-quality, recently constructed crude oil pipeline, gathering system, transportation, storage and rail loading facilities in the Williston Basin of North Dakota. This transaction benefits Tesoro by providing direct access to additional advantaged crude oil for its West Coast refineries and has the potential to reduce supply costs as the Company continues to strengthen its supply position. Additionally, the system will provide ratable pipeline volumes that should ultimately benefit Tesoro Logistics once offered to the master limited partnership, which is expected in 2016.

Tesoro’s Alaska subsidiary agreed to acquire Flint Hills Resources' (FHR) wholesale marketing and logistics assets in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska. This transaction improves Tesoro's ability to serve customers from its existing Anchorage terminal, as a result of Tesoro gaining access to rail loading capabilities located at the FHR Anchorage terminal. This extends Tesoro's ability to efficiently and reliably serve the Alaska interior. Tesoro plans to offer qualified third parties access to the FHR Anchorage terminal. Additionally, Tesoro expects to offer to Tesoro Logistics the opportunity to acquire these assets.

Non-GAAP Measures

Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze operating segment performance. To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), our management uses additional metrics that are known as “non-GAAP” financial metrics in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (“EBITDA”). We define EBITDA as consolidated earnings, including earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, excluding net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, before depreciation and amortization expense, net interest and financing costs and income taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus or minus amounts determined to be “special items” by our management based on their unusual nature and relative significance to earnings (loss) in a certain period. We provide complete reconciliation and discussion of items identified as special items with our presentation of adjusted EBITDA. We define Free Cash Flow as cash flow from operations less sustaining capital expenses comprised of maintenance and regulatory capital expenditures and the return of excess cash flows to shareholders through dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interest.

We present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because we believe some investors and analysts use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to help analyze our cash flows including our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations with respect to our indebtedness and use cash for other purposes, including capital expenditures. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are also used by some investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance and by management for internal analysis. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to U.S. GAAP net earnings or net cash from operating activities. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and net cash from operating activities.

We present net earnings from continuing operations adjusted for special items (“Adjusted Earnings”) and net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations adjusted for special items (“Adjusted Diluted EPS”) as management believes that the impact of these items on net earnings from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is important information for an investor’s understanding of the operations of our business and the financial information presented. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Diluted EPS should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings, earnings per diluted share or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Diluted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities.

Items Impacting Comparability

In previous periods, our branded operations represented the assets and operations that were previously shown as the retail segment and a portion of our marketing business related to sales in unbranded or wholesale channels were presented within our refining operating segment. Upon considering the changes in our business, including the transition from company-owned retail operations to multi-site operator model, we assessed how our chief operating decision maker evaluates the business, assesses performance and allocates resources. From this analysis, we believed the presentation of a marketing segment inclusive of both unbranded and branded marketing operations was appropriate. As of the second quarter 2015, we revised our operating segments to include refining, TLLP and a realigned marketing segment. Comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised segment presentation. No other changes were deemed necessary to our refining and TLLP segments.

The TLLP financial and operational data presented include the historical results of all assets acquired from Tesoro prior to the acquisition dates. The acquisitions from Tesoro were transfers between entities under common control. Accordingly, the financial information of TLLP contained herein has been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of the assets acquired from Tesoro prior to the effective date of each acquisition for all periods presented. The TLLP financial data is derived from the combined financial results of the TLLP predecessor (the “TLLP Predecessor”). We refer to the TLLP Predecessor and, prior to each acquisition date, the acquisitions from Tesoro collectively, as “TLLP’s Predecessors”.

TLLP acquired assets related to the Rockies Natural Gas Business on December 2, 2014, which is engaged in natural gas gathering, transportation and processing in or around the Green River Basin located in Wyoming and Colorado, the Uinta Basin located in eastern Utah, the Vermillion Basin located in Southern Wyoming, northwest Colorado and northeast Utah and the portion of the Williston Basin located in North Dakota.

Certain 2014 financial information has been revised to conform with current year presentation. In addition, certain 2014 EBITDA financial information has been revised to conform with EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presentation disclosed by TLLP on a standalone basis.
