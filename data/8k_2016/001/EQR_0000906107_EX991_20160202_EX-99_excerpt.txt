Equity Residential Reports Full Year 2015 Results

Same Store Revenue Increased 5.1%

Same Store NOI Increased 6.5%

Normalized FFO per Share Increased 9.1%

Chicago, IL - February 2, 2016 - Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015. All per share results are reported as available to common shares on a diluted basis.

“We are delighted to have delivered a 9.1% increase in Normalized FFO in 2015 driven by another very strong year of same store revenue growth,” said David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential’s President and CEO. “We are also pleased to have started the New Year very much in line with our original expectations and that 2016 will be yet another year of strong apartment fundamentals and above trend revenue growth.”

Fourth Quarter 2015

FFO (Funds from Operations), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $0.92 per share compared to $0.87 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The difference is due primarily to the various non-comparable items listed on page 25 of this release and the items described below.

For the fourth quarter of 2015, the company reported Normalized FFO of $0.93 per share compared to $0.86 per share in the same period of 2014. The following items impacted Normalized FFO per share in the quarter:

•a positive impact of approximately $0.08 per share from higher same store net operating income (NOI) and approximately $0.01 per share from NOI from non-same store properties currently in lease-up; and

•a negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share of lower NOI due to 2014 and 2015 transaction activity, higher general and administrative costs and other items. 

Normalized FFO begins with FFO and eliminates certain items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period or that tend to obscure the company’s actual operating performance. Reconciliations and definitions of FFO and Normalized FFO are provided on pages 7 and 27 of this release and the company has included guidance for Normalized FFO on page 26 and FFO on page 27 of this release.

For the fourth quarter of 2015, the company reported earnings of $0.55 per share compared to $0.59 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The difference is due primarily to lower gains on asset sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the items described above.

Year Ended December 31, 2015

FFO for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $3.48 per share compared to $3.15 per share in the same period of 2014.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the company reported Normalized FFO of $3.46 per share compared to $3.17 per share for the same period of 2014.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the company reported earnings of $2.36 per share compared to $1.73 per share for the same period of 2014. The difference is due primarily to higher gains on property sales and improved operations during the year ended December 31, 2015.

Same Store Results

On a same store fourth quarter to fourth quarter comparison, which includes 98,202 apartment units, revenues increased 5.2%, expenses increased 2.0% and NOI increased 6.8%. Average rental rate increased 5.2% and occupancy remained even at 96.0%.

On a same store year to year comparison, which includes 96,286 apartment units, revenues increased 5.1%, expenses increased 2.5% and NOI increased 6.5%. Average rental rate increased 4.8% and occupancy increased 0.3% to 96.1%.

Investment Activity

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the company acquired three properties, two in Seattle and one in Orange County, California, consisting of 423 apartment units for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $165.8 million at a weighted average capitalization (cap) rate of 4.7%.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the company sold one consolidated apartment property located in Seattle, consisting of 150 apartment units, for a sale price of approximately $48.5 million at a cap rate of 4.5% generating an unlevered internal rate of return (IRR), inclusive of indirect management costs, of 12.8%.

During 2015, the company acquired four properties consisting of 625 apartment units for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $296.0 million at a weighted average cap rate of 4.5% and three contiguous land parcels for an aggregate purchase price of $27.8 million. Also during 2015, the company completed seven development projects consisting of 1,546 apartment units for a total development cost of approximately $835.1 million.

During 2015, the company sold eight consolidated apartment properties, consisting of 1,857 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of approximately $390.0 million at a weighted average cap rate of 5.5%. The company also sold a 193,230 square foot medical office building located adjacent to its Longfellow Place property in Boston for approximately $123.3 million at a cap rate of 4.5%. These combined sales generated an unlevered IRR, inclusive of indirect management costs, of 13.4%.

Asset Sale to Starwood

As previously announced on January 27, 2016, the company completed the sale of 72 properties consisting of 23,262 apartment units to controlled affiliates of Starwood Capital Group for $5.365 billion, or approximately $230,634 per unit on average, generating an unlevered IRR, inclusive of indirect management costs, of 11.1%.

2

Debt Extinguishments

In connection with the Starwood sale and other anticipated 2016 asset sales, the company has retired in 2016 approximately $1.7 billion in debt principal prior to scheduled maturity with an additional $271.2 million anticipated to be retired at par at maturity on March 15, 2016. In addition, no commercial paper or revolving credit facility balances were outstanding as of February 2, 2016. The debt payoffs included both secured and unsecured debt in order to maintain the company’s existing credit metrics and strong credit profile. The company incurred approximately $112.4 million in prepayment penalties associated with these debt extinguishments. The prepayment penalties, including certain related write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs, premiums/discounts and derivative settlements, will reduce earnings per share and FFO in the first quarter of 2016 by approximately $120.1 million but will not impact Normalized FFO. A summary table of the debt retired is set forth below: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

First Quarter 2016 Guidance

The company has established a Normalized FFO guidance range of $0.73 to $0.77 per share for

the first quarter of 2016. The difference between the company’s fourth quarter 2015 Normalized FFO of $0.93 per share and the midpoint of the first quarter 2016 guidance range of $0.75 per share is due primarily to:

•a negative impact of approximately $0.17 per share from lower NOI due to 2016 transaction activity including the portfolio sale to Starwood;

•a negative impact of approximately $0.04 per share from lower NOI primarily as a result of higher seasonal operating expenses in the first quarter of 2016;

•a negative impact of approximately $0.01 per share from higher general and administrative and property management costs; and

•a positive impact of approximately $0.04 per share from lower total interest expense.

3

Full Year 2016 Guidance

The company has established a Normalized FFO guidance range of $3.00 to $3.20 per share for the full year 2016. The assumptions underlying this guidance can be found on page 26 of this release. The difference between the company’s full-year 2015 Normalized FFO of $3.46 per share and the midpoint of the full year 2016 guidance range of $3.10 per share is primarily due to:

•a negative impact of approximately $0.90 per share from lower NOI due to 2016 transaction activity including the portfolio sale to Starwood;

•a positive impact of approximately $0.23 per share from higher NOI from the company’s full year 2016 same store pool of approximately 70,000 apartment units;

•a positive impact of approximately $0.12 per share from higher NOI from development properties in lease-up;

•a positive impact of approximately $0.21 per share from lower total interest expense; and

•a negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share from other items.

Special Dividends and 2016 Common Share Dividend

In addition to regular quarterly dividends, Equity Residential anticipates paying two special dividends to its common shareholders in 2016 totaling $10.00 to $12.00 per share. The company expects to pay, in the second quarter of 2016, a special dividend of approximately $8.00 per share from proceeds from the asset sales closed in the first few months of 2016, including the sale to Starwood, and an additional special dividend of approximately $2.00 to $4.00 per share later in the year from the proceeds of additional asset sales.

In regards to the company’s regular quarterly common share dividend, as previously announced, the company’s dividend policy is to pay 65% of the midpoint of the range of Normalized FFO guidance customarily provided as part of the company’s fourth quarter earnings release. Based on the guidance above, the company expects to pay four quarterly common share dividends of $0.50375 per share for an annual common share dividend of $2.015 per share in 2016. All future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the company’s Board of Trustees.

Equity Residential expects to announce first quarter 2016 results on Tuesday, April 26, 2016 and host a conference call to discuss those results at 10:00 a.m. CT on Wednesday, April 27, 2016.

(1)The Company's primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income ("NOI"). NOI represents rental income less direct property operating expenses (including real estate taxes and insurance) as well as an allocation of indirect property management costs. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment communities. See page 27 for reconciliations from operating income.

(2)Average rental rate is defined as total rental revenues divided by the weighted average occupied apartment units for the period.

Definitions and Footnotes for Pages 7, 25 and 26

(1)The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines funds from operations ("FFO") (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP")), excluding gains (or losses) from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of apartment units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property.

(2)Normalized funds from operations ("Normalized FFO") begins with FFO and excludes:

 • the impact of any expenses relating to non-operating asset impairment and valuation allowances;

 • property acquisition and other transaction costs related to mergers and acquisitions and pursuit cost write-offs;

 • gains and losses from early debt extinguishment, including prepayment penalties, preferred share redemptions and the cost related to the implied option value of non-cash convertible debt discounts;

 • gains and losses on the sales of non-operating assets, including gains and losses from land parcel and condominium sales, net of the effect of income tax benefits or expenses; and

 • other miscellaneous non-comparable items.

(3)The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. The Company also believes that Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the Company's operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company's actual operating results. FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.

(4)FFO available to Common Shares and Units and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the "Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership". Subject to certain restrictions, the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.

(5)Earnings represents net income per share calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Expected earnings is calculated on a basis consistent with actual earnings. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual earnings could differ materially from expected earnings.
