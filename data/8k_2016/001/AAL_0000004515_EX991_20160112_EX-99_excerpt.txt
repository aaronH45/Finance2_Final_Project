General Overview  

   •   Pre-tax Margin—The Company expects its fourth quarter pre-tax margin excluding special charges to be approximately 12 to 14 percent.  

   •   Capacity—2015 total system capacity was up approximately 1 percent vs. 2014. Full year domestic capacity was up approximately 1 percent to 2 percent year-over-year, while international capacity was flat to up approximately 1 percent vs. 2014.  

   •   Cash—As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $6.9 billion in total cash and short-term investments, of which $695 million was restricted.(the foregoing amounts are after giving effect to the write-off of Venezuelan bolivars described below). The Company also had an undrawn revolving credit facility of $2.4 billion.  

   •   Fuel—For the fourth quarter 2015, the Company expects to pay an average of between $1.48 and $1.53 per gallon of mainline jet fuel (including taxes). Forecasted volume and fuel prices are provided in the tables below.  

   •   Cargo / Other Revenue—Includes cargo revenue, frequent flyer revenue, ticket change fees, excess/overweight baggage fees, first and second bag fees, contract services, airport clubs and inflight service revenues.  

   •   Taxes—As of December 31, 2014, AAG had approximately $10.1 billion of net operating losses (NOLs) available to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2015. The Company also had approximately $4.6 billion of NOLs available to reduce future state taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2015. The Company currently expects to record a nominal amount of cash tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to certain states and foreign jurisdictions where NOLs are limited or not available to be used.  

   •   Labor Update - On November 30th, 2015, the Company ratified a joint collective bargaining agreement (JCBA) covering its Customer Service, Customer Assistance, Premium Service, Reservations and Travel Center employees. The Company expects the JCBA to increase 2016 full year consolidated CASM by approximately 0.5 points.  

   •   Fourth Quarter Special Items - The Company expects to book a net special credit of approximately $2 billion in the fourth quarter, consisting principally of the following items:  

Venezuela Cash Position - In connection with the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for the fourth quarter of 2015, management has concluded that due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela, the Company will recognize a $592 million special charge in the fourth quarter of 2015 to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held.  

Income Tax Valuation Allowance Reversal - In accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the Company provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets, which includes the NOLs, when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of September 30, 2015, a full valuation allowance was provided on these deferred tax assets. In connection with the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for the fourth quarter of 2015, management has determined that critical integration milestones have been met, and for purposes of applicable GAAP, the Company will be profitable on a sustained basis. Accordingly, the Company will reverse approximately $2.9 billion of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation  

January 12, 2016  

The Company is providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors the ability to measure financial performance excluding special items, which is more indicative of the Company’s ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. The Company believes that the presentation of mainline CASM excluding fuel and special items and regional CASM excluding fuel and special items is useful to investors because both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond the Company’s control.
