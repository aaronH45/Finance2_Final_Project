SECTION 8 – OTHER EVENTS  

Item 8.01 Other Events.  

On February 29, 2016, Sysco Corporation (the “Company” or “Sysco”) issued a press release (the “Press Release”) announcing additional details of the Company’s three-year plan, including a revised technology strategy focused on improving the customer experience, a productivity plan to reduce its workforce by approximately 2 percent and a more aggressive operating income growth target. In connection with the implementation of the revised technology strategy and the productivity plan, Sysco expects that its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 will reflect the following estimated certain items: (1) a $27 million write-off relating to the discontinuation of pending SAP projects, (2) $10 million in accelerated depreciation of existing SAP assets and (3) $5 million in severance costs. The Press Release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
