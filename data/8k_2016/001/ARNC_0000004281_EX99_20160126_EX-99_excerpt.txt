  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  In order to calculate both basic and diluted earnings per share for the quarters ended December 31, 2014, September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2015, preferred stock dividends declared of $19, $18, and $17, respectively, need to be subtracted from Net income (loss) attributable to Alcoa.  

 (2)  In the fourth quarter of 2014, Alcoa issued 37 million shares of its common stock as part of the consideration paid to acquire Firth Rixson. As a result, the basic average number of shares for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 includes 17 million representing the weighted average number of shares for the length of time the 37 million shares were outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2014, and the respective basic average number of shares for the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015 includes all 37 million shares.  

Additionally, in the third quarter of 2015, Alcoa issued 87 million shares of its common stock to acquire RTI International Metals. As a result, the basic average number of shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 includes 58 million representing the weighted average number of shares for the length of time the 87 million shares were outstanding during the third quarter of 2015, and the basic average number of shares for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 includes all 87 million shares.  

 (3)  In the quarters ended December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015, the difference between the respective diluted average number of shares and the respective basic average number of shares relates to share equivalents associated with outstanding employee stock options and awards. The respective diluted average number of shares for the quarters ended December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2015 does not include any share equivalents related to the mandatory convertible preferred stock as their effect was anti-dilutive. Additionally, the diluted average number of shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 does not include any share equivalents related to convertible debt (acquired through RTI International Metals) as their effect was anti-dilutive. In the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the diluted average number of shares does not include any share equivalents as their effect was anti-dilutive.  

 (4)  As described in the Amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K to which this exhibit is included therein, these amounts were updated to reflect the impact associated with an unfavorable outcome of a litigation matter in Italy.

 (1)  In order to calculate both basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, preferred stock dividends declared of $21 and $69, respectively, need to be subtracted from Net income (loss) attributable to Alcoa.  

 (2)  In the first quarter of 2014, holders of $575 principal amount of Alcoa’s 5.25% Convertible Notes due March 15, 2014 (the “Notes”) exercised their option to convert the Notes into 89 million shares of Alcoa common stock. As a result, the basic average number of shares for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes 73 million representing the weighted average number of shares for the length of time the 89 million shares were outstanding during 2014, and the basic average number of shares for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes all 89 million shares.  

Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2014, Alcoa issued 37 million shares of its common stock as part of the consideration paid to acquire Firth Rixson. As a result, the basic average number of shares for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes 4 million representing the weighted average number of shares for the length of time the 37 million shares were outstanding during 2014, and the basic average number of shares for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes all 37 million shares.  

Furthermore, in the third quarter of 2015, Alcoa issued 87 million shares of its common stock to acquire RTI International Metals. As a result, the basic average number of shares for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes 37 million representing the weighted average number of shares for the length of time the 87 million shares were outstanding during 2015.  

 (3)  In the year ended December 31, 2014, the difference between the diluted average number of shares and the basic average number of shares relates to share equivalents associated with outstanding employee stock options and awards. The diluted average number of shares for the year ended December 31, 2014 does not include any share equivalents related to the Notes or mandatory convertible preferred stock as their effect was anti-dilutive. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the diluted average number of shares does not include any share equivalents as their effect was anti-dilutive.

Consolidated Balance Sheet (unaudited)  

(in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  On November 19, 2014, Alcoa completed the acquisition of Firth Rixson. As a result, Alcoa’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014 included an estimate of the beginning balance sheet of Firth Rixson. This estimate resulted in the allocation of $1,227 of the $3,125 purchase price (includes $130 of contingent consideration) to various assets, primarily Properties, plants, and equipment, and liabilities with the difference included in Goodwill. In 2015, an adjustment of $128 was recorded to decrease the initial amount recorded as Goodwill. This adjustment was based on management’s final allocation of the purchase price, which was based, in part, on information from a third-party valuation of the acquired business.  

 (2)  The Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 includes amounts related to the acquisition of RTI International Metals. These amounts are composed of an estimate of the beginning balance sheet of RTI International Metals on the acquisition date, July 23, 2015, and the changes in these balances from July 23, 2015 through December 31, 2015. The estimate of the beginning balance sheet is the result of allocating $625 of the $870 purchase price to various assets, primarily Properties, plants, and equipment, and liabilities with the difference included in Goodwill. The final allocation of the purchase price will be based, in part, on management’s review of information from a third-party valuation of the acquired business, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2016.  

 (3)  In the fourth quarter of 2015, Alcoa adopted changes issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to accounting for income taxes, which requires all deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. These changes were to become effective for Alcoa on January 1, 2017; however, management elected the early adoption provision. As such, all deferred income tax assets and liabilities were classified in the Deferred income taxes and Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits, respectively, line items on the December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, management elected to update the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Balance Sheet for these changes for comparative purposes. As a result, $421 of current deferred income tax assets (previously reported in Prepaid expenses and other current assets) and $83 of current deferred income tax liabilities (previously reported in Taxes, including income taxes) were reclassified to the respective, aforementioned noncurrent asset and liability line items on the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

 (4)  As described in the Amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K to which this exhibit is included therein, these amounts were updated to reflect the impact associated with an unfavorable outcome of a litigation matter in Italy.

Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows (unaudited)  

(in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) In the first quarter of 2015, management decided to reflect the net periodic benefit cost related to Alcoa-sponsored defined benefit pension plans as a separate line item in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. In prior periods, a portion of this amount was reported in both the (Increase) in noncurrent assets (overfunded plans) and the (Decrease) in noncurrent liabilities (underfunded plans) line items. As a result, the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 was revised to conform to the current period presentation.  

 (2)  The (Increase) in noncurrent assets line item for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes a $300 prepayment related to a natural gas supply agreement for three alumina refineries in Western Australia, which are owned by Alcoa’s majority-owned subsidiary, Alcoa of Australia Limited.  

 (3)  In the first quarter of 2014, holders of $575 principal amount of Alcoa’s 5.25% Convertible Notes due March 15, 2014 (the “Notes”) exercised their option to convert the Notes into 89 million shares of Alcoa common stock. This transaction was not reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 as it represents a noncash financing activity.  

 (4)  In the fourth quarter of 2014, Alcoa paid $2,995 (net of cash acquired) to acquire Firth Rixson. A portion of this consideration was paid through the issuance of 37 million shares in Alcoa common stock valued at $610. The issuance of common stock was not reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 as it represents a noncash investing activity.  

In the third quarter of 2015, Alcoa issued 87 million shares of its common stock valued at $870 to acquire RTI International Metals. The issuance of common stock was not reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2015 as it represents a noncash investing activity. However, through this acquisition, Alcoa acquired $302 in cash, which was reflected as a cash inflow in the Acquisitions, net of cash acquired line item on the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

 (5)  Proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes a cash outflow for cash paid as a result of post-closing adjustments associated with the December 2014 divestiture of three rolling mills in Spain and France.

Segment Information (unaudited)  

(dollars in millions, except realized prices; production and shipments in thousands of metric tons [kmt])  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The difference between certain segment totals and consolidated amounts is in Corporate.  

 (1)  Effective in the second quarter of 2015, management removed the impact of metal price lag from the results of the Global Rolled Products and Engineered Products and Solutions (now Engineered Products and Solutions and Transportation and Construction Solutions – see footnote 2 below) segments in order to enhance the visibility of the underlying operating performance of these businesses. Metal price lag describes the timing difference created when the average price of metal sold differs from the average cost of the metal when purchased by the respective segment. The impact of metal price lag is now reported as a separate line item in Alcoa’s reconciliation of total segment ATOI to consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Alcoa. As a result, this change does not impact the consolidated results of Alcoa. Segment information for all prior periods presented was updated to reflect this change.  

 (2)  In the third quarter of 2015, management approved a realignment of Alcoa’s Engineered Products and Solutions segment due to the expansion of this part of Alcoa’s business portfolio through both organic and inorganic growth. This realignment consisted of moving both the Alcoa Wheel and Transportation Products and Building and Construction Systems business units to a new reportable segment named Transportation and Construction Solutions. Additionally, the Latin American soft alloy extrusions business previously included in Corporate was moved into the new Transportation and Construction Solutions segment. The remaining Engineered Products and Solutions segment consists of the Alcoa Fastening Systems and Rings (renamed to include portions of the Firth Rixson business acquired in November 2014), Alcoa Power and Propulsion (includes the TITAL business acquired in March 2015), Alcoa Forgings and Extrusions (includes the other portions of Firth Rixson), and Alcoa Titanium and Engineered Products (a new business unit that represents the RTI International Metals business acquired in July 2015) business units. Segment information for all prior periods presented was updated to reflect the new segment structure.

Calculation of Financial Measures (unaudited)  

(in millions, except per-share amounts)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net income (loss) attributable to Alcoa – as adjusted is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of Alcoa excluding the impacts of restructuring and other charges, discrete tax items, and other special items (collectively, “special items”). There can be no assurances that additional special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both Net income (loss) attributable to Alcoa determined under GAAP as well as Net income attributable to Alcoa – as adjusted.  

 (1)  Discrete tax items include the following:  

   •   for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, a charge for valuation allowances related to certain U.S. and Iceland deferred tax assets ($190) and a net benefit for a number of small items ($3);  

   •   for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, a net charge for a number of small items;  

   •   for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, a charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets of a subsidiary in Spain due to a tax rate change ($16), a benefit for an adjustment to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets of a subsidiary in Brazil due to a tax rate change ($3), and a net charge for a number of small items ($3);  

   •   for the year ended December 31, 2015, a charge for valuation allowances related to certain U.S. and Iceland deferred tax assets ($190) and a net benefit for a number of small items ($4); and  

   •   for the year ended December 31, 2014, a charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets of a subsidiary in Brazil due to a tax rate change ($31), a charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets of a subsidiary in Spain due to a tax rate change ($16), and a net benefit for a number of other items ($14).  

 (2)  Other special items include the following:  

   •   for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, a write-down of inventory related to the permanent closure or temporary curtailment of various facilities in Suriname and the United States ($28), an impairment of goodwill related to the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil ($25), costs associated with the planned separation of Alcoa ($12), a net unfavorable change in certain mark-to-market energy derivative contracts ($5), and an unfavorable tax impact related to the interim period treatment of operational losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized ($2);  

   •   for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, an unfavorable tax impact resulting from the difference between Alcoa’s consolidated estimated annual effective tax rate and the statutory rates applicable to special items ($27), a gain on the sale of land in the United States and an equity investment in a China rolling mill ($25), costs associated with the planned separation of Alcoa and the acquisition of RTI International Metals ($22), a favorable tax impact related to the interim period treatment of operational losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized ($16), a write-down of inventory related to a refinery in Suriname ($13), and a net unfavorable change in certain mark-to-market energy derivative contracts ($10);  

   •   for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, an unfavorable tax impact resulting from the difference between Alcoa’s consolidated estimated annual effective tax rate and the statutory rates applicable to special items ($81), a favorable tax impact related to the interim period treatment of operational losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized ($44), costs associated with the acquisition of Firth Rixson and the then-planned acquisition of TITAL ($22), and a net favorable change in certain mark-to-market energy derivative contracts ($2);  

   •   for the year ended December 31, 2015, costs associated with the planned separation of Alcoa and the acquisitions of RTI International Metals and TITAL ($46), a gain on the sale of land in the United States and an equity investment in a China rolling mill ($44), a write-down of inventory related to the permanent closure or temporary curtailment of various facilities in Suriname, the United States, Brazil, and Australia ($43), an impairment of goodwill related to the soft alloy extrusions business in Brazil ($25), and a net unfavorable change in certain mark-to-market energy derivative contracts ($17); and  

   •    for the year ended December 31, 2014, a write-down of inventory related to the permanent closure of various facilities in Italy, Australia, and the United States ($47), costs associated with the acquisition of Firth Rixson and the then-planned acquisition of TITAL ($47), a gain on the sale of both a mining interest in  

     Suriname and an equity investment in a China rolling mill ($20), an unfavorable impact related to the restart of one potline at the joint venture in Saudi Arabia that was previously shut down due to a period of pot instability ($19), costs associated with preparation for and ratification of a new labor agreement with the United Steelworkers ($11), a net unfavorable change in certain mark-to-market energy derivative contracts ($6), and a loss on the write-down of an asset to fair value ($2).  

 (3)  The average number of shares applicable to diluted EPS for Net income (loss) attributable to Alcoa common shareholders excludes certain share equivalents as their effect was anti-dilutive (see footnote 3 to the Statement of Consolidated Operations). However, certain of these share equivalents may become dilutive in the EPS calculation applicable to Net income attributable to Alcoa common shareholders – as adjusted due to a larger and/or positive numerator. Specifically:  

   •   for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, share equivalents associated with outstanding employee stock options and awards were dilutive based on Net income attributable to Alcoa common shareholders – as adjusted, resulting in a diluted average number of shares of 1,324,378,133;  

   •   for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, no additional share equivalents were dilutive based on Net income attributable to Alcoa common shareholders – as adjusted, resulting in a diluted average number of shares of 1,294,392,945;  

   •   for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, share equivalents associated with mandatory convertible preferred stock were dilutive based on Net income attributable to Alcoa common shareholders – as adjusted, resulting in a diluted average number of shares of 1,294,701,805 (the subtraction of preferred stock dividends declared from the numerator (see footnote 1 to the Statement of Consolidated Operations) needs to be reversed since the related mandatory convertible preferred stock was dilutive);  

   •   for the year ended December 31, 2015, share equivalents associated with both outstanding employee stock options and awards and convertible notes related to the acquisition of RTI International Metals were dilutive based on Net income attributable to Alcoa common shareholders – as adjusted, resulting in a diluted average number of shares of 1,288,633,988 (after-tax interest expense of $8 needs to be added back to the numerator since the convertible notes were dilutive); and  

   •   for the year ended December 31, 2014, share equivalents associated with both Alcoa’s 5.25% convertible notes and mandatory convertible preferred stock were dilutive based on Net income attributable to Alcoa common shareholders – as adjusted, resulting in a diluted average number of shares of 1,217,720,724 (after-tax interest expense of $6 needs to be added back to the numerator since the convertible notes were dilutive and the subtraction of $19 of the preferred stock dividends declared from the numerator (see footnote 1 to the Statement of Consolidated Operations) needs to be reversed since the related mandatory convertible preferred stock was dilutive).

Alcoa’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is net margin plus an add-back for depreciation, depletion, and amortization. Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation, depletion, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information with respect to Alcoa’s operating performance and the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations. The Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures due to the fact that these expenditures are considered necessary to maintain and expand Alcoa’s asset base and are expected to generate future cash flows from operations. It is important to note that Free Cash Flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements, are not deducted from the measure.

Days Working Capital = Working Capital divided by (Sales/number of days in the quarter).  

 (1)  The deferred purchase price receivable relates to an arrangement to sell certain customer receivables to several financial institutions on a recurring basis. Alcoa is adding back this receivable for the purposes of the Days Working Capital calculation.  

 (2)  The Working Capital for each period presented represents an average quarter Working Capital, which reflects the capital tied up during a given quarter. As such, the components of Working Capital for each period presented represent the average of the ending balances in each of the three months during the respective quarter.  

 (3)  In the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, Working Capital and Sales include $708 and $387, respectively, and $924 and $422 respectively, related to three acquisitions, Firth Rixson (November 2014), TITAL (March 2015), and RTI International Metals (July 2015). Excluding these amounts, Days Working Capital was 31 and 29 for the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
