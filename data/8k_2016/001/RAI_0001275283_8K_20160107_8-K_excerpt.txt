Item 8.01 Other Events.  

On January 4, 2016, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (“RJRT”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Reynolds American Inc. (“RAI”), received from B.A.T. (U.K. and Export) Limited (“BATUKE”), a wholly owned subsidiary of British American Tobacco p.l.c. (“BAT”), a written notice (the “Notice”) terminating, with effect from January 5, 2019 (the “Termination Date”), the Restated and Revised American-blend Cigarette Manufacturing Agreement, dated May 14, 2015, among RJRT, BATUKE and BATUS Japan, Inc. (“BATUSJ”), a wholly owned subsidiary of BAT (such agreement, the “Manufacturing Agreement”). Under the Manufacturing Agreement, RJRT is currently BATUKE’s exclusive manufacturer of all of BATUKE’s requirements for certain American-blend cigarettes intended to be sold and distributed in Japan.  

BATUKE delivered the Notice pursuant to the Manufacturing Agreement’s provision allowing a party to terminate the Manufacturing Agreement by furnishing, no earlier than January 1, 2016, three years’ notice of termination. The Manufacturing Agreement will remain in effect until the Termination Date, subject to earlier termination as provided therein, including without limitation, the right of a party to terminate upon the material, uncured breach of the Manufacturing Agreement by another party.  

BAT, through wholly owned subsidiaries other than BATUKE and BATUSJ, owns approximately 42% of RAI’s outstanding common stock.
