Wynn Palace Project in Macau

The Company is currently constructing Wynn Palace, a fully integrated resort featuring a 1,700-room hotel, a performance lake, and a wide range of amenities, including meeting, retail, food-and-beverage, and gaming space, in the Cotai area of Macau. In July 2013, we signed a $2.6 billion guaranteed maximum price (GMP) contract for the project’s construction. The total project budget, including construction costs, capitalized interest, pre-opening expenses, land costs and financing fees, is approximately $4.1 billion. 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we invested approximately $433.4 million in our Cotai project, taking the total investment to date to $3.5 billion.

Wynn Project in Massachusetts

In November 2014, we were awarded a gaming license to develop and construct an integrated resort in Everett, Massachusetts, adjacent to Boston. The resort will be located on a 33-acre site along the Mystic River. The resort will contain a hotel, a waterfront boardwalk, meeting space, a casino, a spa, retail offerings, and food-and-beverage outlets. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we began site remediation, site preparation and pre-construction activities. 

Balance Sheet and Other

Our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities at December 31, 2015 totaled $2.3 billion.

Total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $9.2 billion, including $4.1 billion of Wynn Macau debt, $3.2 billion of Wynn Las Vegas debt and $1.9 billion of debt at the parent company and other. 

During the 2015 year-end close process, the Company identified a $33.8 million decrease in the fair value of the Redemption Note, resulting in an increase to net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited of $22.4 million that should have been recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2015. While the Company determined these amounts were immaterial, considering both quantitative and qualitative factors, it has elected to revise the amounts in the three months ended September 30, 2015, and will include disclosure of the adjustments in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. These non-cash amounts do not affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 or adjusted property EBITDA, adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited or adjusted net income per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015.

Forward-looking Statements

This release contains forward-looking statements regarding operating trends and future results of operations. Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from 

2 

those we express in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, our dependence on existing management, results of regulatory or enforcement actions and probity investigations, pending or future legal proceedings, uncertainties over the development and success of new gaming and resort properties, adverse tourism trends, general global macroeconomic conditions, changes in gaming laws or regulations, volatility and weakness in world-wide credit and financial markets, and our substantial indebtedness and leverage. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect the Company’s financial results is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the Company’s other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update or revise its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

(1) “Adjusted property EBITDA” is net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other, intercompany golf course and water rights leases, stock-based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, change in interest rate swap fair value, change in Redemption Note fair value and other non-operating income and expenses, and includes equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses adjusted property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors. The Company also presents adjusted property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company’s ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, adjusted property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company’s performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, adjusted property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property EBITDA. Also, Wynn Resorts’ calculation of adjusted property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

(2) "Adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited" is net income before pre-opening costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, change in interest rate swap fair value, change in Redemption Note fair value, and property charges and other, net of noncontrolling interest and taxes in respective jurisdictions. Adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited and adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited per diluted share (“adjusted EPS”) are presented as supplemental disclosures because management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. These measures are used by management and/or evaluated by some investors, in addition to income and EPS computed in accordance with GAAP, as an additional basis for assessing period-to-period results of our business. Adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited and adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited per diluted share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. 

The Company has included schedules in the tables that accompany this release that reconcile (i) net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited to adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited, (ii) operating income to adjusted property EBITDA, and (iii) adjusted property EBITDA to net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited.
