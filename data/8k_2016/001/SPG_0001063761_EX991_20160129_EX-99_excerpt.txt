    EARNINGS RELEASE  

"I am very pleased to report another year of industry-leading growth with record earnings and dividends for our company," said David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Over the last five years, our FFO and dividends per share have achieved compound annual growth rates of 14% and 18%, respectively. We expect to achieve industry-leading growth again in 2016, driven by our unparalleled execution, irreplaceable assets and fortress balance sheet."

(2)Same space measure that compares opening and closing rates on individual spaces leased during trailing 12-month period. 

(3)Trailing 12-month sales per square foot for mall stores less than 10,000 square feet in Malls and stores less than 20,000 square feet in Premium Outlets for 2015.  

        COMPARABLE PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME ("NOI") 

Comparable property NOI growth for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was 3.7%. The growth for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was 3.4%. Comparable properties include U.S. Malls, Premium Outlets and The Mills. Comparable property NOI in the fourth quarter was affected by a year-over-year decrease in overage rent due to the effect the stronger dollar had on tenant sales at the Company's tourist-oriented centers.

Today Simon's Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.60 per share. This is a 14.3% increase year-over-year. The dividend will be payable on February 29, 2016 to stockholders of record on February 12, 2016.

        DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY 

During the fourth quarter, we opened two new Premium Outlets and completed two significant expansions.   

• On October 1st, we opened Tucson Premium Outlets, a 367,000 square foot center with more than 90 retailers featuring high-quality designer and name brands. Simon owns 100% of this center.  

• On October 9th, we completed a new two-level, 260,000 square foot 'Fashion Wing' expansion at Del Amo Fashion Center, anchored by a new Nordstrom store. Simon owns a 50% interest in this center.  

• On October 29th, Tampa Premium Outlets opened with 441,000 square feet of high-quality, name brand stores. Simon owns 100% of this center.  

• In December, we completed a 56,000 square foot expansion of The Colonnade at Sawgrass Mills. Simon owns 100% of this center.  

Construction continues on other significant expansion projects including Roosevelt Field, King of Prussia, Stanford Shopping Center, The Galleria in Houston, and Woodbury Common Premium Outlets.  

During the fourth quarter, construction started on a transformational redevelopment of The Shops at Riverside to offer a complete luxury shopping, dining and entertainment experience that will further establish this landmark property as the luxury hub in Bergen County, New Jersey. Construction also started on Siheung Premium Outlets, a 399,000 square foot center in Siheung (Seoul), South Korea scheduled to open in April 2017. Simon owns 50% of this project.  

At quarter-end, redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, were underway at 29 properties in the U.S. and Europe. Simon's share of the costs of all new development and redevelopment projects under construction at quarter-end was approximately $2.1 billion.  

        FINANCING ACTIVITY 

The Company was active in both the unsecured and secured credit markets in 2015 continuing to lower our effective borrowing costs and extend our maturity profile.  

The Company completed two senior notes offerings, one in U.S. dollars and the other in Euros, totaling $1.9 billion (U.S. dollar equivalent), with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.34% and weighted average term of 7.5 years. During the year, we redeemed four series of senior notes comprising approximately $1.7 billion at a weighted average coupon rate of 6.00%. The two new notes offerings were approximately 370 basis points lower in rate than the notes we redeemed during the year.  

The Company also amended and extended its $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, increasing its capacity to $2.75 billion, and reducing its pricing to LIBOR plus 80 basis points and the facility fee down to 10 basis points while extending the term to June 30, 2020.  

With regard to secured debt activity, we completed 23 new loans totaling approximately $4.3 billion (U.S. dollar equivalent), of which Simon's share is $2.8 billion. The weighted average interest rate and term on these loans is 3.28% and 8.5 years, respectively.

Certain statements made in this press release may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained, and it is possible that the Company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

The Company discusses these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in its annual and quarterly periodic reports filed with the SEC. The Company may update that discussion in its periodic reports, but except as required by law, the Company undertakes no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.

 Footnotes to Unaudited Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

        Notes: 

(A)Excess investment represents the unamortized difference of our investment over equity in the underlying net assets of the related partnerships and joint ventures shown therein. The Company generally amortizes excess investment over the life of the related properties. 

(B)The Unaudited Joint Venture Statements of Operations do not include any operations or our share of net income or excess investment amortization related to our investment in Klépierre. Amounts included in Footnotes D below exclude our share of related activity for our investment in Klépierre. For further information on Klépierre, reference should be made to financial information in Klépierre's public filings and additional discussion and analysis in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q/As for the periods ending March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015. 

(C)This report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by GAAP, including FFO, FFO per share, comparable FFO per share and comparable EPS. FFO is a performance measure that is standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO provides investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs. 

We determine FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). We determine FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales or disposals of, or any impairment charges related to, previously depreciated retail operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. 

We have adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale or disposal of, or any impairment charges relating to, previously depreciated retail operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

FFO and NOI are performance measures that are standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO and NOI provide investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with the performance of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.  

The non-GAAP financial measures used in this report should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity nor are they indicative of cash flows from operating and financial activities. Reconciliations of other non-GAAP measures used in this report to the most-directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the tables on pages 18-19, 22 and 23 and in the Earnings Release for the latest period.

   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]    

(1)Excludes WPG properties. 

(2)Ending Occupancy is the percentage of total owned square footage (GLA) which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period. We include all company owned space except for mall anchors, mall majors, mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation. 

(3)Total Sales PSF is defined as total sales of the tenants open and operating in the center during the reporting period divided by the associated company owned and occupied GLA on a trailing 12-month basis. Includes tenant sales activity for all months a tenant is open within the trailing 12-month period. In accordance with the standard definition of sales for regional malls adopted by the International Council of Shopping Centers, stores with less than 10,000 square feet are included for malls and stores with less than 20,000 square feet are included for Premium Outlets for 2015. 

(4)Base Minimum Rent PSF is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in Ending Occupancy as defined above. 

(5)Releasing Spread is a "same space" measure that compares opening and closing rates on individual spaces, including spaces greater than 10,000 square feet. The Opening Rate is the average of the initial cash Total Rent PSF for spaces leased during the trailing 12-month period, and includes new leases and existing tenant renewals, amendments and relocations (including expansions and downsizings). The Closing Rate is the average of the final cash Total Rent PSF as of the month the tenant terminates or closes. Total Rent PSF includes Base Minimum Rent, common area maintenance (CAM) and base percentage rent. It includes leasing activity on all spaces occupied by tenants that would qualify to be included in Ending Occupancy as defined above as long as the opening and closing dates are within 24 months of one another. 

(6)Occupancy Cost as a Percentage of Sales is the trailing 12-month Base Minimum Rent, plus all applicable ancillary charges, plus overage rent, if applicable (based on last 12 months of sales), divided by the trailing 12-month Total Sales PSF for the same tenants.
