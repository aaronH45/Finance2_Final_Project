On February 18, 2016, following a meeting of the Board of Directors of United Continental Holdings, Inc.

The Company now expects to complete its current $3 billion authorization, announced in July 2015, by the second half of 2016, ahead of the Company’s original expectation to complete the program by the end of 2017.
