“Fiscal 2016 is off to a very strong start in what we expect to be another record year,” said Donnie Smith, president and chief executive officer of Tyson Foods. “Solid execution across the entire team resulted in record earnings, record operating income, record margins and record cash flows. We captured $121 million in total synergies for the quarter, with $61 million incremental to fiscal first quarter 2015.

“Our on-going efforts to invest in and grow our Core 9 product lines are paying off as sales volume for the most recent four week period was up 4%. The Core 9 product lines represent our strongest brands, greatest pricing power and best category growth opportunities and are major contributors to volume and profitability in the retail channel,” Smith said. The Core 9 is composed of nine retail product lines in the Tyson®, Jimmy Dean®, Hillshire Farm®, Ball Park®, State Fair® and Aidells® brands.

“Record cash flows of $1.1 billion allowed for $300 million of share repurchases in the quarter,” Smith said. “We've repurchased $550 million of our shares in the past two quarters, plus an additional $200 million to date in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Given the pace of our stock buy backs, our board of directors increased our repurchase authorization by 50 million shares.

“Due to our strong results in the first quarter and our positive outlook on the rest of the year, we are raising our fiscal 2016 earnings guidance to $3.85 - $3.95 per share. We have a consumer-relevant portfolio packed with advantaged brands in advantaged categories, we have a superior supply chain, and we have a high-performing team focused on execution. I’m really excited about what’s ahead.”

Note: Excluding the fiscal 2015 divestitures of our chicken operations in Brazil and Mexico, along with our Heinold Hog Markets business, total company volume declined 1.1%. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we began reporting the International segment in Other due to the sale of our Mexico and Brazil chicken production operations in fiscal 2015. As a result, Other includes our foreign chicken production operations in China and India, in addition to third-party merger and integration costs. All periods presented have been reclassified to reflect this change. Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods were not impacted by this change.

Adjustments to Segments for the first quarter of fiscal 2015

•Prepared Foods operating income was adjusted for the following:

◦Increase of $36 million of ongoing costs related to a legacy Hillshire Brands plant fire.

◦Increase of $4 million related to merger and integration costs.

•Other operating income was adjusted for the following:

◦Increase of $15 million related to merger and integration costs.

Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are presented as supplementary financial measurements in the evaluation of our business. We believe the presentation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin helps investors assess our financial performance from period to period and enhances understanding of our financial performance; however, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin may not be comparable to those of other companies in our industry, which limits the usefulness as comparative measures. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are not measures required by or calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for any measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Investors should rely primarily on our GAAP results, and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally in making investment decisions.

Summary of Segment Results

•Chicken - Sales volume decreased as a result of optimizing mix and our buy versus grow strategy, partially offset by an increase in rendered product sales. Average sales price decreased as feed ingredient costs declined, partially offset by mix changes. Operating income increased due to improved operational execution and lower feed ingredient costs. Feed costs decreased $60 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.

•Beef - Sales volume decreased due to a reduction in live cattle processed primarily due to the closure of our Denison, Iowa, facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Average sales price decreased due to higher domestic availability of fed cattle supplies, which drove down livestock costs. Operating income increased due to more favorable market conditions associated with an increase in supply which drove down fed cattle costs. 

•Pork - Sales volume decreased due to the divestiture of our Heinold Hog Markets business in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of the divestiture, our sales volume grew 5.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, driven by better demand for our pork products. Live hog supplies increased, which drove down livestock cost and average sales price. Operating income remained strong as we maximized our revenues relative to live hog markets and due to better plant utilization associated with higher volumes.

•Prepared Foods - Sales volume decreased due to a change in sales mix in addition to the avian influenza impact on our turkey operations. Average sales price decreased primarily due to a decline in input costs, partially offset by a change in product mix. Operating income improved due to mix changes as well as lower input costs of approximately $125 million. Additionally, Prepared Foods operating income was positively impacted by $95 million in synergies, of which $40 million was incremental synergies in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 above the $55 million of synergies realized in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.

Outlook

In fiscal 2016, we expect domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to increase approximately 2-3% from fiscal 2015 levels and moderate export growth. As a result, increased domestic availability could pressure protein pricing. As we proceed with the integration of Hillshire Brands, we expect to realize incremental synergies in excess of $200 million above the amount of synergies realized in fiscal 2015. In total, we expect synergies of more than $500 million in fiscal 2016 and more than $700 million in fiscal 2017 from the acquisition as well as our profit improvement plan for our legacy Prepared Foods business. The majority of these benefits will be realized in our Prepared Foods segment. The following is a summary of the outlook for each of our segments, as well as an outlook on sales, capital expenditures, net interest expense, liquidity and share repurchases for fiscal 2016.

•Chicken – USDA data shows an increase in chicken production around 1-2% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Based on current futures prices, we expect lower feed costs in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 of approximately $200 million. Many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter-term in nature, but there may be a lag time for price changes to take effect. For fiscal 2016, we now believe our Chicken segment's operating margin should be more than 11%, up from our previous estimate of more than 10%. 

•Beef – We expect industry fed cattle supplies to be slightly higher in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Although we generally expect adequate supplies in regions we operate our plants, there may be periods of imbalance of fed cattle supply and demand. For fiscal 2016, we believe our Beef segment's operating margin should be at or above the low end of its normalized range of 1.5-3.0%.

•Pork – We expect industry hog supplies to increase around 2-3% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, we now believe our Pork segment's operating margin should be above its normalized range of 6-8%, up from our previous estimate of within the range.

•Prepared Foods – We expect lower raw material costs of approximately $250 million in fiscal 2016. As we continue to invest heavily in innovation, new product launches and the strengthening of our brands, we believe the operating margin of our Prepared Foods segment should be near the low-end of its normalized range of 10-12% in fiscal 2016.

•Other – Other includes our foreign operations related to raising and processing live chickens in China and India in addition to third-party merger and integration costs. We now expect Other operating loss should be approximately $70 million in fiscal 2016.

•Sales – We believe sales will approximate $37 billion. This is down from our previous estimate of $41 billion due to declines in beef, pork and feed prices. 

•Capital Expenditures – We expect capital expenditures to approximate $900 million for fiscal 2016. 

•Net Interest Expense – We expect net interest expense to approximate $245 million for fiscal 2016, which is down from our previous estimate of $255 million due to lower estimated debt balances. 

•Liquidity – We expect total liquidity, which was $2.4 billion at January 2, 2016, to remain above our minimum liquidity target of $1.2 billion. Liquidity at the end of the first quarter was enhanced by cash held for payments deferred to calendar 2016 by livestock suppliers as well as cash held for the retirement of the $638 million notes due in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 

•Share Repurchases – In fiscal 2016, we expect to increase share repurchases under our share repurchase program. As of January 2, 2016, 13.5 million shares remain authorized for repurchases. On February 4, 2016, our Board of Directors approved an increase of 50 million shares authorized for repurchase under our share repurchase program. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares will depend upon, among other things, our working capital needs, market conditions, liquidity targets, our debt obligations and regulatory requirements. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016 to date, we repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares for $200 million, excluding shares repurchased to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans.

EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Net debt to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA) represents the ratio of our debt, net of cash and short-term investments, to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, net debt to EBITDA and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA are presented as supplemental financial measurements in the evaluation of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is a tool intended to assist our management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations on an ongoing basis. 

We believe the presentation of these financial measures helps management and investors to assess our operating performance from period to period, including our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt, and enhances understanding of our financial performance and highlights operational trends. These measures are widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies; however, the measurements of EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) and net debt to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA) may not be comparable to those of other companies, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures. EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) and net debt to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA) are not measures required by or calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered as substitutes for net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of operating cash flow or liquidity. EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) is a useful tool for assessing, but is not a reliable indicator of, our ability to generate cash to service our debt obligations because certain of the items added to net income to determine EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) involve outlays of cash. As a result, actual cash available to service our debt obligations will be different from EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA). Investors should rely primarily on our GAAP results and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally in making investment decisions.
