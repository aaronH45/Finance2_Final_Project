 •   2015 Adjusted EPS of $2.59, compared to Adjusted EPS of $1.86 in 2014; 2015 Reported EPS of $1.62, compared to 2014 reported EPS of $1.20  

 •   Company Provides Full Year 2016 Outlook for Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow  

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Wednesday, February 10, 2016 – Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE: SEE) today announced financial results for fourth quarter and full year 2015. Commenting on these results, Jerome A. Peribere, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “In 2015, net sales increased 3% on an organic basis to $7.0 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 230 basis points and Free Cash Flow was $595 million. This is the third consecutive year where we executed on our commitments and delivered year-over-year operational improvements irrespective of the economic environment. In 2016, we estimate organic net sales growth of 3.5% and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion, an organic increase of 7% to 9%. Additionally, we expect to generate approximately $550 million in Free Cash Flow in 2016 including a planned increase in capital expenditures to $275 million from $184 million in 2015. Our performance in 2016 will be driven by ongoing productivity improvements, further adoption of our more advanced product portfolio, and early successes with our Change the Game initiatives. All of this will accelerate future growth and drive margin expansion,” continued Mr. Peribere.  

Unless otherwise stated, all results compare fourth quarter 2015 results to fourth quarter 2014 results. Year-over-year financial discussions present operating results as reported, and on an organic or constant dollar basis. Constant dollar refers to unit volume and price/mix performance and excludes the impact of currency translation from all periods referenced. Organic refers to unit volume and price/mix performance and excludes the impact of currency translation and the results from the divestiture of the North American foam trays and absorbent pads business, which was divested on April 1, 2015 and the divestiture of the European food trays business in November 2015 (together “divestitures”), from all periods referenced. Additionally, non-U.S. GAAP adjusted financial measures, such as Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Adjusted Net Earnings, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (“Adjusted EPS”) and Adjusted Tax Rate, exclude the impact of special items, such as restructuring charges, Venezuela remeasurement, cash-settled stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) granted as part of the Diversey acquisition and certain other infrequent or one-time items. Please refer to the financial statements included with this press release for a reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP to U.S. GAAP financial measures.  

Full Year 2015 Highlights  

   •   Food Care delivered positive price/mix of 2.6% with favorable trends across all regions. This was complemented by volume growth of 1.3% primarily attributable to increases in North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific. Positive price/mix and volume growth were a result of new product adoption, increased market penetration of advanced packaging solutions and pricing disciplines. Food Care Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 280 basis points to 20.3% for the full year 2015. This performance was attributable to favorable mix and price/cost spread, higher volumes, as well as cost synergies, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, higher non-material inflationary costs and divestitures. In 2015, Food Care completed divestitures of non-core assets, which resulted in a decrease of $172 million to net sales and $33 million to Adjusted EBITDA.  

   •   In Diversey Care, favorable price/mix was 1.9% and volume increased 1.2%. Favorable price/mix was positive across all regions and volume increased in North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific. This performance was attributable to growth within its core customer base and new customer wins primarily in healthcare, building service contractors and food and retail services sectors. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 30 basis points to 11.6% for the full year 2015. Margin performance was due to favorable mix and price/cost spread and cost synergies, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and higher expenses related to targeted investments in sales and marketing, research and development, and the acquisition of Intellibot.  

   •   In Product Care, strong growth in the e-Commerce and third party logistics markets were offset by rationalization efforts in North America, Latin America and to a smaller extent in EMEA, and weakness in the industrial sectors. This led to a 2.3% decline in volume, partially offset by favorable price/mix of 1.4% for the full year 2015. Price/mix was favorable across all regions. Product Care substantially completed its rationalization efforts in Latin America and its efforts in North America and EMEA are expected to continue through the first half of 2016. While sales declined slightly, Product Care expanded Adjusted EBITDA margins 310 basis points to 20.8% for the full year 2015. This performance was primarily attributable to favorable mix and price/cost spread and cost synergies, partially offset by lower volumes and unfavorable currency translation.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Summary  

Fourth quarter 2015 net sales of $1.75 billion decreased 11.1% on an as reported basis and 1.5% on a constant dollar basis. For the full year 2015, net sales totaled $7.0 billion, a decrease of 9.3% as reported and 0.6% in constant dollars. Currency had a negative impact on net sales of $190 million in the fourth quarter and $764 million in 2015. Food Care related divestitures also had a negative impact on net sales in the quarter and in 2015. Adjusting for currency translation and divestitures, organic net sales growth was 1.7% in the fourth quarter and 2.8% in the full year as a result of favorable price/mix trends on essentially flat volumes.  

On a regional basis, Latin America increased 7.0% on a constant dollar basis in the fourth quarter, and 6.3% for the year. Asia Pacific was essentially flat in the quarter and up 2.4% in constant dollars for the year. On an organic basis, North America declined 0.1% in the fourth quarter and increased 1.6% in 2015, while EMEA was up 2.8% and 3.2% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Food Care and Diversey Care increased sales in North America in the quarter and for the full year.  

Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2015 was $282 million, or 16.1% of net sales, compared to $282 million, or 14.3% of net sales, in fourth quarter 2014. Adjusted EBITDA results were negatively impacted by currency of $30 million, and divestitures of $11 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 180 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The year-over-year margin increase was primarily attributable to favorable mix and price/cost spread, cost synergies, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and the impact of divestitures. Excluding currency translation and the impact of divestitures, Adjusted EBITDA delivered organic growth of 14.9% in the fourth quarter.  

Full year 2015 Adjusted EBITDA was $1.17 billion, or 16.7% of net sales, compared to $1.12 billion, or 14.4% of net sales, in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA results were negatively impacted by currency of $126 million, and divestitures of $33 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 230 basis points compared to last year. The 2015 margin increase as compared to 2014 was attributable to favorable mix and price/cost spread and cost synergies, partially offset by higher SG&A costs, unfavorable currency translation and the impact of the divestitures. Excluding currency translation and the impact of divestitures, Adjusted EBITDA delivered organic growth of 19.2% for the full year.  

Fourth quarter 2015 net earnings on a reported basis were $124 million, or $0.62 per diluted share as compared to $66 million, or $0.31 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2014. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 included $27 million of special items, primarily consisting of restructuring and other associated costs, as well as a loss on the divestiture of our European food trays business. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 included $60 million of special items, primarily consisting of restructuring and other associated costs, and loss on debt redemption and refinancing activities. Adjusted EPS was $0.76 for the fourth quarter 2015. This compares to Adjusted EPS of $0.59 in the fourth quarter 2014. The Adjusted Tax Rate was 7.6% in the fourth quarter 2015, compared to 9.2% in the fourth quarter 2014. The reduction in the Adjusted Tax Rate was primarily attributable to the recording of net foreign tax credits that were previously deemed not recognizable and a more tax efficient means to repatriate offshore earnings.  

Full year 2015 net earnings on a reported basis were $335 million or $1.62 per diluted share as compared to $258 million, or $1.20 per diluted share in the full year 2014. Net earnings in 2015 included $201 million of special items, primarily consisting of restructuring and other associated costs, loss on debt redemption and refinancing activities, as well as a tax reserve recorded in relation to the tax refund received on the Settlement agreement (as defined in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014), partially offset by the release of certain tax reserves recorded at the time of the Diversey Holdings, Inc. acquisition, for which the statute of limitations had expired. Net earnings in 2014 included $141 million of special items, primarily consisting of restructuring and other associated costs, and loss on debt redemption and refinancing activities. Adjusted EPS was $2.59 for 2015. This compares to Adjusted EPS of $1.86 in 2014. The Adjusted Tax Rate was 20.2% in the full year 2015, compared to 22.1% in the full year 2014. The reduction in the Adjusted Tax Rate had a favorable impact on adjusted EPS of $0.06 and was primarily attributable to the recording of net foreign tax credits that were previously deemed not recognizable and a more tax efficient means to repatriate offshore earnings.  

In 2015, the Company repurchased approximately 16.1 million shares of its common stock for approximately $802 million. The average diluted shares outstanding as of December 31, 2015 was 207 million as compared to 214 million as of December 31, 2014.  

Cash Flow and Net Debt  

Cash flow provided by operating activities in 2015 was $968 million. In March 2015, the Company received a tax refund of $235 million related to the payment of funds in connection with the Settlement agreement. Excluding the tax refund, cash flow provided by operating activities in 2015 was $733 million, which is net of $98 million of restructuring and $21 million of SARs payments. This compares with cash used by operating activities of $215 million in 2014, which is net of $108 million of restructuring, $21 million of SARs payments and $930 million related to the Settlement agreement. Capital expenditures were $184 million in the full year 2015 compared to $154 million in 2014.  

Free Cash Flow, defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (excluding the Settlement agreement and excess tax benefit) less capital expenditures, was an inflow of $595 million in 2015, compared with $599 million in 2014. The decrease was attributable to unfavorable currency impact, changes in other assets and liabilities and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower interest payments and higher earnings.  

Compared to December 31, 2014, the Company’s net debt increased $73 million to $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily a result of amounts paid for share repurchases and dividends, partially offset by cash reflecting the tax refund related to the Settlement agreement payment and cash generated from operating activities.  

2  

Outlook for Full Year 2016  

The Company estimates net sales to be approximately $6.8 billion for the full year 2016, which assumes an unfavorable impact of approximately $400 million or 6% from foreign currency translation. Adjusted for unfavorable currency and a $102 million decline related to 2015 divestitures, net sales in 2016 are expected to increase approximately 3.5% on an organic basis.  

Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion, which assumes $65 million of unfavorable currency translation. On an organic basis, which excludes unfavorable currency and a reduction of $21 million related to 2015 divestitures, Adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase in the range of 7% to 9%.  

Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.52 to $2.60. The outlook assumes an Adjusted Tax Rate of 24%. Adjusted EPS guidance excludes the impact of special items.  

The Company anticipates 2016 Free Cash Flow to be approximately $550 million, including capital expenditures of approximately $275 million and cash restructuring payments of approximately $110 million.

 (2) The remaining amount of unvested cash-settled stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) fully vested on March 31, 2015. However, we will continue to incur expense related to these SARs until the last expiration date of these awards (March 2021). The amount of related future expense will fluctuate based on exercise and forfeiture activity and changes in the assumptions used in the valuation model, including the price of Sealed Air common stock.  

 (3)  Based on changes to the Venezuelan currency exchange rate mechanisms, in the first quarter of 2014, we changed the exchange rate we used to remeasure our Venezuelan subsidiaries’ financial statements into U.S. dollars. As a result, as of December 30, 2014 our excess cash position in our Venezuelan subsidiaries was remeasured at the SICAD 2 rate resulting in a $2 million and $20 million loss for the three and twelve months ended December 30, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, based on further changes in the Venezuelan exchange rate mechanisms and our specific facts and circumstances, we changed the rate used to remeasure all of our Bolivar denominated net monetary assets to the SIMADI rate of 198.6986. As a result of the change, we recorded a remeasurement loss of $2 million and $33 million in the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively.  

 (4)  As previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2014, on February 3, 2014 we funded the cash consideration ($930 million) and issued the shares reserved under the Settlement agreement as defined therein. As a result, we recognized a gain on Claims Settlement of $21 million, which primarily consisted of the release of certain tax and other liabilities.  

 (5) In June 2015, we issued $400 million of 5.5% senior notes due 2025 and €400 million of 4.5% senior notes due 2023 and used the net proceeds of these notes to retire the existing $750 million of 8.375% senior notes due 2021. The aggregate repurchase price was $866 million, which primarily included the principle amount of $750 million, premium of $99 million and accrued interest of $17 million. We recognized a total net pre-tax loss of $111 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015, which included the premiums mentioned above. Also included in the loss on debt redemption was $11 million of accelerated amortization of original non-lender fees related to the 8.375% senior notes.

 (2) In January 2015, we completed the sale relating to our building located in Racine, Wisconsin. As of December 31, 2014, the building and certain related assets were included in assets held for sale. Accordingly, we transferred $26 million from assets held for sale as of December 31, 2014. In addition, during the second quarter we completed the sale of our North American foam trays and absorbent pads business. During the first quarter of 2015, the assets and liabilities met the criteria of held for sale classification. Accordingly, we had reclassified $42 million of assets and $6 million of liabilities to held for sale as of December 31, 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of our European food trays business. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the assets and liabilities met the criteria of held for sale classification. Accordingly, we had reclassified $37 million of assets and $7 million of liabilities to held for sale as of December 31, 2014. Additionally, we reclassified $13 million from accounts payable to short-term borrowings related to extended payment terms on a vendor agreement and $36 million from cash to other assets related to cash used as collateral for borrowing agreements.

 (1)  The supplementary information included in this press release for 2015 is preliminary and subject to change prior to the filing of our upcoming Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

 (2) For the year ended December 31, 2014, certain amounts related to foreign currency gains and losses, including the remeasurement loss related to Venezuelan subsidiaries in 2014, the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts, and cash flows associated with the extension of payment terms on a vendor payment agreement were misclassified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The reclassification of these items resulted in an increase in cash used in operating activities of $13 million, a decrease to cash used in investing activities of $15 million, and an increase of $15 million due to the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes in cash. Additionally, we reclassified $13 million from accounts payable to short-term borrowings related to extended payment terms on a vendor agreement and $36 million from cash to other assets related to cash used as collateral for borrowing agreements.  

 (3)  2015 primarily consists of loss on bond redemption of $110 million, depreciation and amortization of $213 million, share-based compensation expense of $61 million, and a remeasurement loss of $33 million, partially offset by a gain on sale of business of $(25) million. 2014 primarily consists of depreciation and amortization of $267 million, profit sharing expense of $54 million, loss on debt redemption and refinancing activities of $103 million and the development grant matter of $14 million and a remeasurement loss of $20 million, partially offset by gain on Settlement agreement of $(21) million.  

 (4)  During the first quarter of 2015, the Company received the tax refund of $235 million related to the Settlement agreement payment. During the first quarter of 2014, we used $930 million of cash to fund the cash portion of the Settlement agreement and related accrued interest. To fund the cash payment, we used $555 million of cash and cash equivalents and utilized borrowings of $260 million from our revolving credit facility and $115 million from our accounts receivable securitization programs. We recorded an excess tax benefit of $46 million as an out of period adjustment in December 2015 and $38 million in December 2014 related to the 18 million shares of Common Stock issued in the Settlement agreement.  

 (5) During the second quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of our North American foam trays and absorbent pads business for net cash proceeds of $76 million, resulting in the recording of a $27 million pre-tax gain and in the fourth quarter we completed the sale of our European food trays business for net cash proceeds of $19 million, resulting in the recording of a $13 million pre-tax loss.  

 (6)  Free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures, including mandatory debt servicing requirements or non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure.  

 (7)  Interest payments in 2014 include $417 million related to the Settlement agreement.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  The supplementary information included in this press release for 2015 is preliminary and subject to change prior to the filing of our upcoming Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

 (2)  Our price/mix reported above includes the net impact of our pricing actions and rebates as well as the period-to-period change in the mix of products sold. Also included in our reported price/mix is the net effect of some of our customers purchasing our products in non-U.S. dollar or euro denominated countries at selling prices denominated in U.S. dollars or euros. This primarily arises when we export products from the U.S. and euro-zone countries.  

 (3)  Changes in these items excluding the impact of foreign currency translation are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. Since we are a U.S. domiciled company, we translate our foreign-currency-denominated financial results into U.S. dollars. Due to changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, translating our financial results from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact. It is important that we take into account the effects of foreign currency translation when we view our results and plan our strategies. Nonetheless, we cannot control changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, when our management looks at our financial results to measure the core performance of our business, we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation by translating our current period results at prior period foreign currency exchange rates. We also may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when making incentive compensation determinations. As a result, our management believes that these presentations are useful internally and may be useful to our investors.
