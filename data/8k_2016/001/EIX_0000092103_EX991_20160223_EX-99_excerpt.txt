Edison International Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2015 Results; Introduces 2016 Earnings Guidance

ROSEMEAD, Calif., February 23, 2016 - Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported fourth quarter 2015 net loss on a GAAP basis of $79 million, or $0.24 per share, compared to net income of $420 million, or $1.29 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. On an adjusted basis, Edison International’s fourth quarter 2015 core earnings were $287 million, or $0.88 per share, compared to $355 million, or $1.08 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Southern California Edison's (SCE) fourth quarter 2015 core earnings decreased by $66 million, or $0.20 per share, from the fourth quarter 2014 primarily due to lower authorized California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) revenue from implementation of the 2015 CPUC General Rate Case (GRC) decision and higher income taxes, partially offset by lower operation and maintenance costs. Edison International Parent and Other’s fourth quarter 2015 core loss increased by $2 million compared to fourth quarter 2014 core losses primarily due to income taxes and expenses. 

Fourth quarter 2015 core earnings exclude losses of $366 million, or $1.12 per share, primarily related to the $382 million, or $1.18 per share, write-down of SCE regulatory assets previously recorded for recovery of deferred income taxes from 2012-2014 incremental tax repair deductions. Fourth quarter 2014 core earnings exclude SCE income of $24 million, or $0.08 per share, related to a revised estimated impact of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) Settlement Agreement, and income of $41 million, or $0.13 per share, primarily due to discontinued operations. 

“Our results are well ahead of earnings guidance,” said Ted Craver, chairman and chief executive officer of Edison International, “and reflect SCE’s strong rate base growth and continued focus on operational excellence. With the potential for continued long-term growth and productivity improvements at SCE along with continued development of Edison Energy Group’s businesses, Edison International is well-positioned in a rapidly changing industry.”

Full-Year Earnings

For the year ended December 31, 2015, Edison International reported net income on a GAAP basis of $1.02 billion, or $3.13 per share, compared to $1.612 billion, or $4.95 per share, during 2014. On an adjusted basis, Edison International’s core earnings were $1.336 billion, or $4.10 per share, compared to $1.497 billion, or $4.59 per share, in 2014.

SCE’s core earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $157 million, or $0.48 per share, from 2014, primarily due to lower CPUC-related revenue from implementation of the 2015 CPUC GRC decision and higher income taxes, partially offset by an increase in Federal Energy Regulatory Commission-related revenue from rate base growth, lower operation and maintenance costs and earnings on funds used during construction. Edison International Parent and Other’s 2015 core losses increased $4 million, or $0.01 per share, compared to 2014 primarily due to income taxes and expenses.

2015 core earnings exclude losses of $316 million, or $0.97 per share, primarily related to the $382 million, or $1.18 per share, write-down of SCE regulatory assets. 2014 core earnings exclude SCE net charges of $72 million, or $0.22 per share, related to the SONGS Settlement, and income of $187 million, or $0.58 per share, primarily due to discontinued operations.

Edison International uses core earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts for significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. Edison International management believes that core earnings provide more meaningful comparisons of performance from period to period. Please see the attached tables for a reconciliation of core earnings to basic GAAP earnings.

2016 Earnings Guidance

The company announced core and basic earnings guidance of $3.81 to $4.01 per share for 2016. See the presentation accompanying the company’s conference call for further information including key guidance assumptions.

Appendix

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Edison International’s earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) used in the United States and represent the company’s earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and core earnings per share (EPS) internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. We also use core earnings and core EPS when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company’s performance from period to period. Financial measures referred to as net income, basic EPS, core earnings, or core EPS also apply to the description of earnings or earnings per share.

Core earnings and core EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core EPS are defined as basic earnings and basic EPS excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. Basic earnings and losses refer to net income or losses attributable to Edison International shareholders. Core earnings are reconciled to basic earnings in the attached tables. The impact of participating securities (vested awards that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for the principal operating subsidiary is not material to the principal operating subsidiary’s EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which is included in Edison International Parent and Other.
