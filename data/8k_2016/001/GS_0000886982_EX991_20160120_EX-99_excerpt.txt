Net Revenues  

Investment Banking  

Full Year  

Net revenues in Investment Banking were $7.03 billion for 2015, 9% higher than 2014. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $3.47 billion, 40% higher than 2014, reflecting strong client activity, particularly in the United States. Industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions increased significantly compared with the prior year. Net revenues in Underwriting were $3.56 billion, 11% lower compared with a strong 2014. Net revenues in debt underwriting were lower compared with 2014, reflecting significantly lower leveraged finance activity. Net revenues in equity underwriting were also lower, reflecting significantly lower net revenues from initial public offerings and convertible offerings, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues from secondary offerings. The firm’s investment banking transaction backlog increased compared with the end of 2014. (4)  

Fourth Quarter  

Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.55 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, 7% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014 and essentially unchanged compared with the third quarter of 2015. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $879 million, 27% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting an increase in client activity in the United States. Net revenues in Underwriting were $668 million, 11% lower than the fourth quarter of 2014, due to significantly lower net revenues in equity underwriting, reflecting lower client activity. This decrease was partially offset by higher net revenues in debt underwriting, reflecting higher net revenues from investment-grade activity. The firm’s investment banking transaction backlog increased compared with the end of the third quarter of 2015. (4)  

Institutional Client Services  

Full Year  

Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $15.15 billion for 2015, essentially unchanged compared with 2014.  

Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $7.32 billion for 2015, 13% lower than 2014. Excluding a gain of $168 million in 2014 related to the extinguishment of certain of the firm’s junior subordinated debt, net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were 12% lower than 2014, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in mortgages, credit products and commodities. These decreases were partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in interest rate products and currencies. During 2015, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution operated in a challenging environment generally characterized by difficult market-making conditions, as well as low levels of client activity in mortgages and credit.  

Net revenues in Equities were $7.83 billion for 2015, 16% higher than 2014. Excluding a gain of $121 million ($30 million and $91 million included in equities client execution and securities services, respectively) in 2014 related to the extinguishment of certain of the firm’s junior subordinated debt, net revenues in Equities were 18% higher than 2014, primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in equities client execution across the major regions, reflecting significantly higher results in both derivatives and cash products, and higher net revenues in securities services, reflecting the impact of higher average customer balances and improved securities lending spreads. Commissions and fees were essentially unchanged compared with 2014. During 2015, Equities operated in an environment generally characterized by improved client activity levels.  

- 2 -  

The fair value net gain attributable to the impact of changes in the firm’s credit spreads on borrowings was $255 million ($214 million and $41 million related to Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, respectively) for 2015, compared with a net gain of $144 million ($108 million and $36 million related to Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, respectively) for 2014.  

Fourth Quarter  

Net revenues in Institutional Client Services were $2.88 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, 9% lower than the fourth quarter of 2014 and 10% lower than the third quarter of 2015.  

Net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution were $1.12 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, 8% lower than the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to significantly lower net revenues in commodities, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in interest rate products. In addition, net revenues in mortgages and currencies were lower, while results in credit products improved compared with a weak fourth quarter of 2014. During the quarter, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution continued to operate in an environment characterized by low levels of client activity and difficult market-making conditions.  

Net revenues in Equities were $1.76 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, 9% lower than the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues in equities client execution, due to significantly lower net revenues in cash products and lower net revenues in derivatives. In addition, commissions and fees were lower, reflecting lower volumes. These results were partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in securities services, primarily reflecting improved securities lending spreads. As compared with the third quarter of 2015, Equities operated in an environment generally characterized by an increase in global equity prices and lower client activity levels.  

The fair value net loss attributable to the impact of changes in the firm’s credit spreads on borrowings was $68 million ($54 million and $14 million related to Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, respectively) for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with a net gain of $82 million ($55 million and $27 million related to Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Client Execution and equities client execution, respectively) for the fourth quarter of 2014.  

- 3 -  

Investing & Lending  

Full Year  

Net revenues in Investing & Lending (8) were $5.44 billion for 2015, 20% lower than 2014. This decrease was primarily due to lower net revenues from investments in equities, principally reflecting the sale of Metro International Trade Services in the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower net gains from investments in private equities, driven by corporate performance. In addition, net revenues in debt securities and loans were significantly lower, reflecting lower net gains from investments.  

Fourth Quarter  

Net revenues in Investing & Lending (8) were $1.30 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, 15% lower than the fourth quarter of 2014 and 93% higher than the third quarter of 2015. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 was primarily due to lower net revenues from investments in equities, driven by a significant decrease in net gains from investments in public equities. In addition, net revenues in debt securities and loans were lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting lower net revenues related to lending commitments to institutional clients.  

Investment Management  

Full Year  

Net revenues in Investment Management were $6.21 billion for 2015, 3% higher than 2014, due to slightly higher management and other fees, primarily reflecting higher average assets under supervision, and higher transaction revenues. During 2015, total assets under supervision (4) increased $74 billion to $1.25 trillion. Long-term assets under supervision increased $51 billion, including net inflows of $71 billion (which includes $18 billion related to an acquisition), and net market depreciation of $20 billion, both primarily in fixed income and equity assets. In addition, liquidity products increased $23 billion.  

Fourth Quarter  

Net revenues in Investment Management were $1.55 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, essentially unchanged compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 and 9% higher than the third quarter of 2015. Management and other fees were essentially unchanged compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, as the impact of higher average assets under supervision was offset by changes in the mix of assets under supervision. During the quarter, total assets under supervision (4) increased $64 billion to $1.25 trillion. Long-term assets under supervision increased $16 billion, including net inflows of $9 billion, spread across all asset classes, and net market appreciation of $7 billion, reflecting appreciation in equity assets. In addition, liquidity products increased $48 billion.

Expenses  

Operating expenses were $25.04 billion for 2015, 13% higher than 2014.  

Compensation and Benefits  

Compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits) were $12.68 billion for 2015, essentially unchanged compared with 2014. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2015 was 37.5% compared with 36.8% for 2014. Total staff increased 8% during 2015, primarily due to activity levels in certain businesses and continued investment in regulatory compliance.  

Non-Compensation Expenses  

Full Year  

Non-compensation expenses were $12.36 billion for 2015, 30% higher than 2014, due to significantly higher net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters, which are included in other expenses. This increase was partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily reflecting lower impairment charges related to consolidated investments, and a reduction in expenses related to the sale of Metro International Trade Services in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for 2015 were $4.01 billion compared with $754 million for 2014 (both primarily comprised of net provisions for mortgage-related matters). 2015 included a $148 million charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives. Compensation was reduced to fund this charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives.  

Fourth Quarter  

Non-compensation expenses were $4.14 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, 64% higher than the fourth quarter of 2014 and 68% higher than the third quarter of 2015. The increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 was due to significantly higher net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters, which are included in other expenses. This increase was partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expenses, reflecting the impact of impairment charges related to consolidated investments in the fourth quarter of 2014.  

Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $1.95 billion compared with $161 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 (both primarily comprised of net provisions for mortgage-related matters). The fourth quarter of 2015 included a $123 million charitable contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives.  

Provision for Taxes  

The effective income tax rate for 2015 was 30.7%, essentially unchanged compared with 31.0% for the first nine months of 2015 and down compared with 31.4% for 2014. The decline compared with 2014 reflected reductions related to a change in the mix of earnings, the impact of changes in tax law on deferred tax assets, settlements of tax audits and the determination that certain non-U.S. earnings would be permanently reinvested abroad, and an increase related to the impact of non-deductible provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters.

This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only the firm’s beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm’s control. It is possible that the firm’s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm’s future results and financial condition, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.  

Information regarding the firm’s capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, supplementary leverage ratio, total assets, level 3 assets and global core liquid assets consists of preliminary estimates. These estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the firm completes its financial statements.  

Statements about the firm’s investment banking transaction backlog also may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval.

Footnotes  

 (1)  On January 14, 2016, the firm announced an agreement in principle, subject to the negotiation of definitive documentation, to resolve the ongoing investigation of the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group of the U.S. Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (RMBS Working Group). The agreement in principle will resolve actual and potential civil claims by the U.S. Department of Justice, the New York and Illinois Attorneys General, the National Credit Union Administration (as conservator for several failed credit unions) and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Chicago and Seattle, relating to the firm’s securitization, underwriting and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities from 2005 to 2007. For additional information, see the firm’s Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on January 14, 2016.  

 (2)  ROE is computed by dividing net earnings (or annualized net earnings for annualized ROE) applicable to common shareholders by average monthly common shareholders’ equity. The table below presents the firm’s average common shareholders’ equity:

 (4)  For information about the firm’s investment banking transaction backlog, assets under supervision, supplementary leverage ratio, global core liquid assets and VaR, see “Results of Operations — Investment Banking,” “Results of Operations — Investment Management,” “Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital,” “Liquidity Risk Management” and “Market Risk Management,” respectively, in Part I, Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2015.  

 (5)  Includes $18 billion of fixed income, equity and alternative investments asset inflows in connection with the acquisition of Pacific Global Advisors’ solutions business for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2015.  

 (6)  The lower of the ratios computed in accordance with the Standardized approach and the Basel III Advanced approach is the binding regulatory capital ratio for the firm. As of December 31, 2015, Common Equity Tier 1 was $71.4 billion and the firm’s risk-weighted assets calculated in accordance with the Standardized Capital Rules and the Basel III Advanced Rules were approximately $524 billion and $578 billion, respectively, each reflecting the applicable transitional provisions. For information about the firm’s capital ratios, see “Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital” in Part I, Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2015.  

 (7)  Represents a preliminary estimate and may be revised in the firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

 (8)  Net revenues related to the firm’s consolidated investments, previously reported in other net revenues within Investing & Lending, are now reported in equity securities and debt securities and loans, as results from these activities ($126 million and $391 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively) are no longer significant principally due to the sale of Metro International Trade Services in the fourth quarter of 2014. Reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current presentation.  

 (9)  The remaining share authorization under the firm’s existing repurchase program is 63.2 million shares as of December 31, 2015, which represents the shares that may be repurchased under the repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors. Prior to repurchasing shares, the firm must receive confirmation that the Federal Reserve Board does not object to such capital actions.  

 (10)  Tangible book value per common share is computed by dividing tangible common shareholders’ equity (total shareholders’ equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets) by common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements. Management believes that tangible common shareholders’ equity and tangible book value per common share are meaningful because they are measures that the firm and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible common shareholders’ equity and tangible book value per common share are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The table below presents a reconciliation of total shareholders’ equity to tangible common shareholders’ equity:  

     As of  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (11)  Unvested share-based awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are treated as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per common share. The impact of applying this methodology was a reduction in basic earnings per common share of $0.05 for both the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and $0.02, $0.01 and $0.01 for the three months ended December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.  

 (12)  Includes $19 billion of fixed income asset inflows in connection with the acquisition of Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management’s stable value business and $6 billion of liquidity products inflows in connection with the acquisition of RBS Asset Management’s money market funds for the year ended December 31, 2014.
