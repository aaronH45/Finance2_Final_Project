        " (a)  The continuing operations were derived from L-3 historical results and were adjusted to: (1) remove NSS results of operations, (2) allocate a portion of L-3’s interest expense to NSS, and (3) realign certain contracts between L-3 and NSS. In addition, certain overhead expenses previously allocated to NSS and included in L-3’s historical results were retained by L-3 and reported as part of L-3 continuing operations. NSS will be reported as discontinued operations beginning with the 2015 fourth quarter."
