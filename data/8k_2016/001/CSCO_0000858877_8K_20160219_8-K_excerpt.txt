 Item 8.01. Other Events.  

On February 19, 2016, John T. Chambers, Executive Chairman of Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”), modified a pre-arranged stock trading plan originally entered into and disclosed in June 2015. Sales under the plan, as modified, may begin in March 2016. The modified plan supersedes the original plan and terminates in December 2016. Under the plan, Mr. Chambers may (i) exercise up to 1,775,000 Cisco stock options set to expire in September and November of 2016, and sell the acquired shares of Cisco stock, and (ii) sell up to 1,000,000 shares of Cisco stock from other shareholdings.  

The transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Cisco’s policies regarding stock transactions.  

Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock. Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time.
