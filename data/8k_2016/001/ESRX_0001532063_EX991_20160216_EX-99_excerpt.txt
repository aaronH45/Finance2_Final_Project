Table 3  

Express Scripts Holding Company Unaudited EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation  

(in millions, except per claim data)  

Provided below is a reconciliation of net income attributable to Express Scripts to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Express Scripts. The Company believes net income is the most directly comparable measure calculated under U.S. GAAP.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Note: See Appendix for Footnotes  

The Company is providing EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA excluding the impact of certain charges (both of which are non-GAAP financial measures) in order to compare the underlying financial performance to prior periods.  

EBITDA attributable to Express Scripts is earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and other expense. EBITDA attributable to Express Scripts is presented because it is a widely accepted indicator of a company’s ability to service indebtedness and is frequently used to evaluate a company’s performance. EBITDA attributable to Express Scripts, however, should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as a measure of operating performance, as an alternative to cash flow, as a measure of liquidity or as a substitute for any other measure computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, our definition and calculation of EBITDA attributable to Express Scripts may not be comparable to that used by other companies.  

Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Express Scripts per adjusted claim is a supplemental measurement used by analysts and investors to help evaluate overall operating performance. We have calculated adjusted EBITDA attributable to Express Scripts excluding transaction and integration costs recorded each year, and a legal settlement, as these charges are not considered an indicator of ongoing company performance. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Express Scripts per adjusted claim is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA attributable to Express Scripts by the adjusted claim volume for the period. This measure is used as an indicator of EBITDA attributable to Express Scripts performance on a per-unit basis. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Express Scripts, and as a result, adjusted EBITDA attributable to Express Scripts per adjusted claim, are each affected by the changes in claim volumes between retail and home delivery, the relative representation of brand-name, generic and specialty pharmacy drugs, as well as the level of efficiency in the business.  

 * Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 presented above includes $86.8 million and $46.0 million, respectively, of depreciation related to the integration of Medco Health Solutions, Inc. (“Medco”) which is not included in transaction and integration costs. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 presented above includes $205.2 million and $92.1 million, respectively, of depreciation related to the integration of Medco which is not included in transaction and integration costs.

Other legacy ESI intangible amortization of $9.4 million ($5.9 million net of tax) and $9.5 million ($5.9 million net of tax) for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, is included in selling, general and administrative expense, respectively. Other legacy ESI intangible amortization of $37.7 million ($23.5 million net of tax) and $37.8 million ($23.5 million net of tax) for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, is included in selling, general and administrative expense, respectively.  

Amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Medco of $399.5 million ($249.5 million net of tax) and $399.5 million ($248.8 million net of tax) for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, is included in selling, general and administrative expense, respectively.

 (4) Transaction and integration costs include those costs directly related to the acquisition of Medco.  

Costs of $77.4 million ($48.4 million net of tax) and $180.9 million ($112.6 million net of tax) are primarily composed of integration-related activities, and are included in gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Costs of $218.0 million ($136.1 million net of tax) and $462.3 million ($288.0 million net of tax) are primarily composed of integration-related activities, and are included in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

Costs of $101.6 million ($63.4 million net of tax) and $201.6 million ($125.6 million net of tax) are primarily composed of professional fees, integration-related activities and severance costs, and are included in selling, general and administrative expense for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Costs of $298.8 million ($186.5 million net of tax) and $614.4 million ($382.8 million net of tax) are primarily composed of professional fees, integration-related activities and severance costs, and are included in selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

 (5) Charge related to a legal settlement of $60.0 million ($37.5 million net of tax) is included in selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

 (6) Debt redemption costs, which include write-off of deferred financing fees incurred for the early repayment of the 2011 term loan, totaled $9.2 million ($5.7 million net of tax) and are included in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. Debt redemption costs, which include write-off of deferred financing fees incurred for the early redemption of senior notes, totaled $75.9 million ($47.3 million net of tax) and are included in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014.  

 (7) Provision for income taxes includes discrete tax benefits of $92.2 million and $79.2 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, compared to net discrete tax benefits of $68.3 million and $113.9 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2014. The 2015 net discrete tax benefits relate primarily to changes in our unrecognized tax benefits as a result of various state audit settlements and lapses in statutes of limitations. The 2014 net discrete tax benefits relate primarily to a change in estimate resulting in the recognition of tax benefits for a permanent deduction related to domestic production activities, offset by charges related to interest on and changes in our unrecognized tax benefits.
