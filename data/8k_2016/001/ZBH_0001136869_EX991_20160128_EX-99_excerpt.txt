(WARSAW, IN) January 28, 2016—Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE and SIX: ZBH) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year  

1  

 ended December 31, 2015. The Company reported fourth quarter net sales of $1.93 billion, an increase of 58.1% over the prior year period on a reported basis, and an increase of 0.5% on an adjusted pro forma, constant currency billing day basis. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.14 reported and $2.09 adjusted, an increase of 17.4% adjusted over the prior year period. Full-year net sales were $6.0 billion, an increase of 28.3% reported over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for the year were $0.26 reported and $6.90 adjusted, an increase of 7.8% adjusted over the prior year.  

“At the close of a transformational year for Zimmer Biomet, we achieved top line growth supported by sequential improvement from our joint reconstructive and S.E.T. businesses in the U.S. In addition, we finished the year with strong earnings results, as we continued to execute on our global integration plans,” said David Dvorak, President and CEO of Zimmer Biomet. “Importantly, the substantial completion of our commercial integration in 2015, combined with the breadth of our musculoskeletal portfolio, positions our sales teams to accelerate our growth as we progress through 2016.”  

Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $29.7 million on a reported basis and $428.3 million on an adjusted basis, an increase of 39.2% adjusted over the prior year period. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $433.2 million.  

During the fourth quarter, the Company paid $44.8 million in dividends and declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.22 per share, consistent with the dividend declared for the prior year period.  

Further, the Company utilized $150 million of cash to acquire 1.4 million shares during the fourth quarter. As of December 31, 2015, $450 million remained available under the current share repurchase authorization.

Guidance  

The Company expects constant currency revenue for the full year 2016, as compared to adjusted pro forma 2015 revenue, to increase between 1.5% and 2.5%. The Company expects foreign currency translation to decrease revenues by 2.0%, resulting in reported revenue between negative 0.5% and positive 0.5% when compared to adjusted pro forma 2015 revenue.  

The Company expects full-year 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $7.80 to $7.95.

Accordingly, investors should monitor the Investor Relations section of our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, presentations and webcasts.

Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

Adjusted earnings per share and adjusted net earnings exclude the effect of inventory step-up and other inventory and manufacturing related charges, certain claims, special items, intangible asset amortization, financing and other expenses related to the Biomet merger and certain tax adjustments. Included in special items are acquisition and integration costs and asset impairment charges related to acquisitions, as well as employee termination benefits, consulting and professional fees, certain litigation matters, dedicated personnel expenses, certain contract terminations and asset impairment charges connected with global restructuring and operational excellence initiatives. “Pro forma” revenue refers to revenue for prior year periods adjusted to reflect the inclusion of Biomet revenue on a GAAP (reported) basis. “Adjusted pro forma” revenue refers to pro forma revenue adjusted to reflect the impact of the previously announced divestiture remedies. “Constant currency” refers to any financial measure that excludes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in this press release.  

Updated Quarter Closing Convention  

In 2015 we changed our quarter-end closing convention for the majority of our international reporting units. As a consequence, our results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2015 include fewer billing days for such international reporting units than were included in our results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2014. This change in quarter closing convention had a minimal impact on the number of billing days for the full-year 2015 relative to the full-year 2014. We have not restated the presentation of our 2014 financial statements to conform to this change of closing convention because the impact of the change is not material to the results of operations or to the comparisons between the 2015 and 2014 periods. In this press release, we compute sales growth rates for the three months ended December 31, 2015 relative to the three months ended December 31, 2014 on a billing day basis. Net sales per billing day in an individual market equal net sales for that market divided by the number of billing days (non-holiday weekdays) in that market.
