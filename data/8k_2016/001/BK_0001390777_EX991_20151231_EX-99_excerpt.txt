“Our results in 2015 demonstrated that our strategic plan has positioned us well to perform in all operating environments. Even with geopolitical instability, emerging market weakness, higher regulatory compliance requirements and low interest rates, we executed on our strategic priorities and focused on what was within our control. For full-year 2015, our earnings per share increased by 19 percent on an adjusted basis as we generated more than 400 basis points of positive operating leverage and achieved a return on tangible common equity of 21 percent. Importantly, we are on track to achieve our three-year goals,” Gerald L. Hassell, chairman and chief executive officer, said. (b)

“In the fourth quarter, we also generated strong positive operating leverage, mainly through our intense focus on our business improvement process, which is creating operating efficiencies for our clients and savings for our shareholders. As we look ahead to 2016, enhancing the client experience continues to be a priority, as we seek to strengthen service quality and productivity by leveraging our investments in industry-leading technologies,” Mr. Hassell added.

“Our focus remains on relentlessly delivering value-added solutions, investment excellence and actionable, data-driven insights to our clients and strong returns to our shareholders. I want to thank our clients for their partnership and confidence in us as well as all our team members around the world for rising to the occasion to meet the heightened expectations of ourselves, our clients and our shareholders,” Mr. Hassell concluded.

In 2015, net income applicable to common shareholders totaled $3.1 billion, or $2.71 per diluted common share, or $3.2 billion, or $2.85 per diluted common share, adjusted for the impairment charge related to a recent court decision, litigation and restructuring charges. In 2014, net income applicable to common shareholders totaled $2.5 billion, or $2.15 per diluted common share, or $2.8 billion, or $2.39 per diluted common share, adjusted for litigation and restructuring charges, the charge related to investment management funds, net of incentives, the gains on the sales of our investment in Wing Hang Bank and the One Wall Street building, and the benefit primarily related to a tax carryback claim.

FOURTH QUARTER 2015 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (a)

(comparisons are 4Q15 vs. 4Q14 unless otherwise stated)

•Earnings

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

N/A - Not applicable.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

- Investment services fees were flat reflecting growth in the Global Collateral Services and Broker-Dealer Services and higher securities lending revenue, offset by lost business in clearing services due to industry consolidations and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.

- Investment management and performance fees decreased 2%, or an increase of 1% on a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP), driven by lower money market fee waivers and higher performance fees, partially offset by net outflows and lower market values.

- Foreign exchange revenue was flat reflecting lower volumes in standing instruction programs and lower volatility, offset by higher volumes in other trading programs and the impact of hedging activity for foreign currency placements.

- Financing-related fees increased $8 million driven by higher fees related to secured intraday credit provided to dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity.

- Investment and other income increased $15 million driven by the higher other income related to termination fees in our clearing business and seed capital gains, partially offset by lower asset-related gains and lease residual gains. 

- Net interest revenue increased $48 million driven by higher yields, the shift out of cash into securities and loans and lower interest expense on deposits.

•The provision for credit losses was $163 million reflecting the impairment charge related to a recent court decision.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Generated more than 300 basis points of positive operating leverage year-over-year on an adjusted basis (Non-GAAP).

•Effective tax rate of 20.1%. The rate is approximately 3% lower primarily due to the impact of the impairment charge and a 2% benefit from a more favorable geographic mix of earnings and higher tax-exempt income.

•Assets under custody and/or administration (“AUC/A”) and Assets under management (“AUM”)

- AUC/A of $28.9 trillion, increased 1% reflecting net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower market values.

-- Estimated new AUC/A wins in Asset Servicing of $49 billion in 4Q15.

- AUM of $1.63 trillion, decreased 4% reflecting the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, net outflows and lower market values, partially offset by the January 2015 acquisition of Cutwater Asset Management. 

-- Net long-term outflows of $11 billion in 4Q15 driven by index and equity investments offset by continued strength in liability-driven investments. 

-- Net short-term inflows totaled $2 billion in 4Q15.

•Capital

- Repurchased 10.1 million common shares for $431 million in 4Q15 and 55.6 million common shares for $2.4 billion in full-year 2015.

- Adjusted return on tangible common equity of 19% in 4Q15 and 21% in full-year 2015 (a).

(a)See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 24 for the reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP excludes net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated investment management funds, amortization of intangible assets, M&I, litigation and restructuring charges, the impairment charge related to a recent court decision and the benefit primarily related to a tax carryback claim, if applicable.

Note: In the table above and throughout this document, sequential growth rates are unannualized.

FINANCIAL SUMMARY

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Primarily attributable to noncontrolling interests related to consolidated investment management funds.

(b)Pre-tax operating leverage is the rate of increase in total revenue less the rate of increase in total noninterest expense. The year-over-year pre-tax operating leverage (Non-GAAP) was based on growth in total revenue, as adjusted (Non-GAAP), of 153 basis points, and a decrease in total noninterest expense, as adjusted (Non-GAAP), of 155 basis points. The sequential operating leverage (Non-GAAP) was based on decline in total revenue, as adjusted (Non-GAAP), of 195 basis points, and an increase in total noninterest expense, as adjusted (Non-GAAP), of 27 basis points.

(c)Non-GAAP excludes the net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests related to consolidated investment management funds, amortization of intangible assets, M&I, litigation and restructuring charges (recoveries), the impairment charge related to a recent court decision and the benefit primarily related to a tax carryback claim, if applicable. See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 24 for the reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures.

(d)Includes fee revenue, net interest revenue and (loss) income from consolidated investment management funds, net of net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Foreign exchange and other trading revenue totaled $173 million in 4Q15 compared with $151 million in 4Q14 and $179 million in 3Q15. In 4Q15, foreign exchange revenue totaled $165 million, flat year-over-year and a decrease of 8% sequentially. Year-over-year, lower volumes in standing instruction programs and lower volatility were offset by higher volumes in the other trading programs and the impact of hedging activity for foreign currency placements. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower volumes and volatility and lower Depositary Receipts-related activity, partially offset by the impact of hedging activity for foreign currency placements.

Other trading revenue was $8 million in 4Q15, compared with an other trading loss of $14 million in 4Q14 and an other trading loss of $1 million in 3Q15. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the losses on hedging activities within one of the Investment Management boutiques recorded in 4Q14.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Investment and other income was $93 million in 4Q15 compared with $78 million in 4Q14 and $59 million in 3Q15. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher other income related to termination fees in our clearing business and seed capital gains, partially offset by lower asset-related gains and lease residual losses. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher asset-related gains, income from corporate/bank owned life insurance and other income related to termination fees in our clearing business, partially offset by lease residual losses.

KEY POINTS

•Total noninterest expense excluding amortization of intangible assets and M&I, litigation and restructuring charges (Non-GAAP) decreased 2% year-over-year and was flat sequentially. 

•The year-over-year decrease reflects lower expenses in all categories, except compensation and employee benefits expenses. The lower expenses primarily reflect the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower professional, legal and other purchased services and other expenses. 

-Compensation expense increased year-over-year primarily reflecting severance expense of approximately $55 million recorded in 4Q15 in ongoing support of our business improvement process.

-Employee benefits expense increased as a result of an adjustment of approximately $30 million related to updated information received from an administrator of our health care benefits, partially offset by the impact of curtailing the U.S. pension plan. 

-Other expense decreased primarily reflecting approximately $35 million of adjustments to bank assessment charges, partially offset by higher asset-based taxes.

•The sequential increase reflects higher staff expense primarily reflecting the factors mentioned above, and higher professional, legal and other purchased services and business development expenses, partially offset by lower other expense, as described above.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO

At Dec. 31, 2015, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio totaled $118.8 billion. The net unrealized pre-tax gain on our total securities portfolio was $357 million at Dec. 31, 2015 compared with $1.05 billion at Sept. 30, 2015. The decrease in the net unrealized pre-tax gain was primarily driven by the increase in interest rates. At Dec. 31, 2015, the fair value of the held-to-maturity securities totaled $43.2 billion and represented 36% of the fair value of the total investment securities portfolio.

The following table shows the distribution of our investment securities portfolio.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Nonperforming assets were $292 million at Dec. 31, 2015, an increase of $169 million compared with $123 million at Sept. 30, 2015. The increase in nonperforming loans in the financial institutions portfolio is related to a recent court decision.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The allowance for credit losses was $275 million at Dec. 31, 2015, a decrease of $5 million compared with $280 million at Sept. 30, 2015. Net charge-offs were $168 million in 4Q15, primarily reflecting the impairment charge related to a recent court decision recorded in the financial institutions portfolio.

CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY

The common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”), Tier 1 and Total risk-based regulatory capital ratios in the first section of the table below are based on Basel III components of capital, as phased-in, and credit risk asset risk-weightings using the U.S. capital rules’ advanced approaches framework (the “Advanced Approach”) as the related risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) were higher when calculated under the Advanced Approach at Dec. 31, 2015, Sept. 30, 2015 and Dec. 31, 2014. Our risk-based capital adequacy is determined using the higher of RWA determined using the Advanced Approach and the U.S. capital rules’ standardized approach (the “Standardized Approach”). The leverage capital ratios are based on Basel III components of capital, as phased-in and quarterly average total assets. Our consolidated capital ratios are shown in the following table. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Regulatory capital ratios for Dec. 31, 2015 are preliminary.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(c)See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 24 for a reconciliation of these ratios.

(d)The estimated SLR on a fully phased-in basis (Non-GAAP) for our largest bank subsidiary, The Bank of New York Mellon, was 4.8% at Dec. 31, 2015 and 4.6% at Sept. 30, 2015. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Primarily related to stock awards, the exercise of stock options and stock issued for employee benefit plans.

Page - 13

BNY Mellon 4Q15 Earnings Release

The table presented below compares the fully phased-in Basel III capital components and ratios to those capital components and ratios determined on a phased-in basis (referred to as the “Transitional Approach”). 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Reflects transitional adjustments to CET1, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital required in 2015 under the U.S. capital rules.

BNY Mellon has presented its estimated fully phased-in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios and SLR based on its interpretation of the U.S. capital rules, which are being gradually phased-in over a multi-year period, and on the application of such rules to BNY Mellon’s businesses as currently conducted. Management views the estimated fully phased-in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios and SLR as key measures in monitoring BNY Mellon’s capital position and progress against future regulatory capital standards. Additionally, the presentation of the estimated fully phased-in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios and SLR are intended to allow investors to compare these ratios with estimates presented by other companies. The estimated fully phased-in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios for certain periods assume certain regulatory approvals. The U.S. capital rules require approval by banking regulators of certain models used as part of RWA calculations. If these models are not approved, the estimated fully phased-in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios would likely be adversely impacted.

Page - 14

BNY Mellon 4Q15 Earnings Release

RWA at Dec. 31, 2014, for credit risk under the estimated fully phased-in Advanced Approach, reflects the use of a simple value-at-risk methodology for repo-style transactions (including agented indemnified securities lending transactions), eligible margin loans, and similar transactions. The estimated fully phased-in Advanced Approach RWA at Dec. 31, 2015 and Sept. 30, 2015 no longer assumes the use of this methodology.

Our capital and liquidity ratios are necessarily subject to, among other things, BNY Mellon’s further review of applicable rules, anticipated compliance with all necessary enhancements to model calibration, approval by regulators of certain models used as part of RWA calculations, other refinements, further implementation guidance from regulators, market practices and standards and any changes BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. Consequently, our capital and liquidity ratios remain subject to ongoing review and revision and may change based on these factors.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio (“SLR”)

The following table presents the components of our estimated SLR using fully phased-in Basel III components of capital.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)The estimated fully phased-in SLR (Non-GAAP) is based on our interpretation of the U.S. capital rules. When the SLR is fully phased-in, we expect to maintain an SLR of over 5%. The minimum required SLR is 3% and there is a 2% buffer, in addition to the minimum, that is applicable to U.S. G-SIBs.  

(b)Dec. 31, 2015 information is preliminary. 

(c)The estimated SLR on a fully phased-in basis (Non-GAAP) for our largest bank subsidiary, The Bank of New York Mellon, was 4.8% at Dec. 31, 2015 and 4.6% at Sept. 30, 2015. At Dec. 31, 2015 and Sept. 30, 2015, total Tier 1 capital was $15,142 million and $14,882 million, respectively, and total leverage exposure was $316,268 million and $322,531 million, respectively, for The Bank of New York Mellon.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”)

The U.S. LCR rules became effective Jan. 1, 2015 and require BNY Mellon to meet an LCR of 80%, increasing annually by 10% increments until fully phased-in on Jan. 1, 2017, at which time we will be required to meet an LCR of 100%. Our estimated LCR on a consolidated basis is compliant with the fully phased-in requirements of the U.S. LCR as of Dec. 31, 2015 based on our current understanding of the U.S. LCR rules.

BNY Mellon 4Q15 Earnings Release

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION – EXPLANATION OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

BNY Mellon has included in this Earnings Release certain Non-GAAP financial measures based on fully phased-in Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios, SLR and tangible common shareholders’ equity. BNY Mellon believes that the Basel III CET1 and other risk-based capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis, the SLR on a fully phased-in basis and the ratio of tangible common shareholders’ equity to tangible assets of operations are measures of capital strength that provide additional useful information to investors, supplementing the capital ratios which are, or were, required by regulatory authorities. The tangible common shareholders’ equity ratio includes changes in investment securities valuations which are reflected in total shareholders’ equity. In addition, this ratio is expressed as a percentage of the actual book value of assets, as opposed to a percentage of a risk-based reduced value established in accordance with regulatory requirements, although BNY Mellon in its reconciliation has excluded certain assets which are given a zero percent risk-weighting for regulatory purposes and the assets of consolidated investment management funds to which BNY Mellon has limited economic exposure. Further, BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets net of deferred tax liabilities, is a useful additional measure for investors because it presents a measure of those assets that can generate income. BNY Mellon has provided a measure of tangible book value per common share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of tangible assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding.

BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures which exclude the effect of noncontrolling interests related to consolidated investment management funds, a gain on the sale of our investment in Wing Hang and a gain on the sale of the One Wall Street building; and expense measures which exclude M&I expenses, litigation charges, restructuring charges and amortization of intangible assets. Earnings per share, return on equity measures and operating margin measures, which exclude some or all of these items, as well as the impairment charge related to a recent court decision, are also presented. Earnings per share and return on equity measures also exclude the benefit primarily related to a tax carryback claim. Operating margin measures may also exclude amortization of intangible assets and the net negative impact of money market fee waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense. BNY Mellon believes that these measures are useful to investors because they permit a focus on period-to-period comparisons, which relate to the ability of BNY Mellon to enhance revenues and limit expenses in circumstances where such matters are within BNY Mellon’s control. The excluded items, in general, relate to certain charges as a result of prior transactions. M&I expenses primarily relate to acquisitions and generally continue for approximately three years after the transaction. Litigation charges represent accruals for loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable, but exclude standard business-related legal fees. Restructuring charges relate to our streamlining actions, Operational Excellence Initiatives and migrating positions to Global Delivery Centers. Excluding these charges mentioned above permits investors to view expenses on a basis consistent with how management views the business. 

The presentation of revenue growth on a constant currency basis permits investors to assess the significance of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Growth rates on a constant currency basis were determined by applying the current period foreign currency exchange rates to the prior period revenue. BNY Mellon believes that this presentation, as a supplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearer picture of the related revenue results without the variability caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

The presentation of income from consolidated investment management funds, net of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related to the consolidation of certain investment management funds permits investors to view revenue on a basis consistent with how management views the business. BNY Mellon believes that these presentations, as a supplement to GAAP information, give investors a clearer picture of the results of its primary businesses. 

In this Earnings Release, the net interest margin is presented on an FTE basis. We believe that this presentation provides comparability of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources, and is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income. Each of these measures as 

Page - 24

described above is used by management to monitor financial performance, both on a company-wide and on a business-level basis.
