On February 25, 2016, Express Scripts Holding Company (the “Company”), certain subsidiaries of the Company named therein (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), entered into a Sixteenth Supplemental Indenture (the “Sixteenth Supplemental Indenture”) to the Indenture dated November 21, 2011 (the “Base Indenture”), among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company named therein and the Trustee, relating to the Company’s 3.300% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”). $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes were sold in a public offering pursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-196442), as amended (the “Registration Statement”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”). The Sixteenth Supplemental Indenture includes the form of the 2021 Notes. The 2021 Notes will pay interest semiannually on February 25 and August 25, beginning on August 25, 2016 at a rate of 3.300% per annum until February 25, 2021.  

On February 25, 2016, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee, entered into a Seventeenth Supplemental Indenture (the “Seventeenth Supplemental Indenture”) to the Base Indenture, relating to the Company’s 4.500% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes” and, together with the 2021 Notes, the “Notes”). $1,500 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes were sold in a public offering pursuant to the Registration Statement.

The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to fund the purchase price and accrued and unpaid interest for the Company’s previously announced tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of the 3.125% Senior Notes due 2016 issued by Express Scripts, Inc. (the “Tender Notes”), and to fund the redemption price and accrued and unpaid interest for any of the Tender Notes that remain outstanding after the completion or termination of the tender offer.
