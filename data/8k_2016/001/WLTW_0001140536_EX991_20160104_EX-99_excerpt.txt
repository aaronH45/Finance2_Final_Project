Willis Towers Watson Merger Successfully Completed 

Combination creates leading global advisory, broking and solutions company serving 80% of the world’s 1,000 largest companies in more than 120 countries 

LONDON and ARLINGTON, VA, January 5, 2016 — Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ: WLTW) began operating today following the successful completion of the merger of Willis Group Holdings and Towers Watson. The company, which will do business as Willis Towers Watson, is a leading global advisory, broking, and solutions company with 39,000 employees in more than 120 countries. 

“Willis Towers Watson is uniquely positioned to see the connections between talent, assets and ideas and how they can lead to strong performance and growth for our clients. We intend to help our clients manage risk and engage their people in a whole new way,” said John Haley, CEO of Willis Towers Watson. “We believe we can change our industry by delivering solutions that are driven by data and analytics, and are integrated, innovative and tailored to meet the evolving needs of our clients.” 

The company advises clients across four business segments: Corporate Risk and Broking; Exchange Solutions; Human Capital and Benefits; and Investment, Risk and Reinsurance. Willis Towers Watson currently serves 80% of the world’s 1,000 largest companies along with many mid-market and smaller businesses around the world. 

“Our focus now is on realizing the full potential of this powerful combination for our clients, our people and our investors,” said Dominic Casserley, Willis Towers Watson President and Deputy CEO. “These are two companies with world-class brands, shared values and now, a vastly expanded set of capabilities, people and geographic reach. Together, we can continue to provide the services and solutions our clients have been used to receiving from us, and also create new offerings that they cannot find elsewhere.” 

Value Creation Potential 

As previously disclosed, Willis Towers Watson expects to generate $4.7 billion in incremental value for shareholders, made up of $375 million to $675 million in incremental revenues through, among other things, expanded distribution of Towers Watson’s health care exchange, expansion of Willis’ large-market P&C brokerage business and further globalization of Towers Watson’s Health and Group Benefits consulting business. Also expected is $100 million to $125 million in annual merger-related cost savings and approximately $75 million in annual tax savings.
