 Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

On February 26, 2016, Foot Locker, Inc. (the “Company”) issued a press release announcing its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2015. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The press release includes non-GAAP financial measures of fourth quarter and full-year 2015 net income excluding the impairment of certain Runners Point Group assets, and a charge related to pension litigation. The press release also includes non-GAAP financial measures of fourth quarter and full-year 2014 net income excluding integration costs associated with Runners Point Group, the impairment of certain trade names, and a gain on the sale of a property. 

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they allow for a more direct comparison of the Company’s performance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2015 to the Company’s performance in the comparable prior-year periods. The non-GAAP financial measures are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these measures is provided in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is part of the press release. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1, which, in its entirety, is incorporated herein by reference. 

The Company is hosting a conference call on February 26, 2016 to discuss its fourth quarter and full-year 2015 financial results, provide its current outlook for 2016, comment on the status of its current initiatives, and discuss trends in its business and the athletic industry. A GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation schedule for all of the non-GAAP measures referred to in the Company’s prepared conference call remarks is attached as Exhibit 99.2.
