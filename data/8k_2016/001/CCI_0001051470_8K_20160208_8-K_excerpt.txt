ITEM 1.01 — ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT  

On February 8, 2016, Crown Castle International Corp. (“Company”) closed its previously announced public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 3.400% Senior Notes due 2021 (“2021 Notes”) and $900 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 4.450% Senior Notes due 2026 (“2026 Notes” and, together with the 2021 Notes, “Notes”). The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of April 15, 2014 (“Base Indenture”), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (“Trustee”), as supplemented by the second supplemental indenture dated as of December 15, 2014 (“Second Supplemental Indenture”), between the Company and the Trustee, and the fourth supplemental indenture dated as of February 8, 2016 (“Fourth Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture and the Second Supplemental Indenture, “Indenture”), between the Company and the Trustee. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, to repay in full all outstanding borrowings under its $1.0 billion senior unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility (and, in connection therewith, terminate all commitments thereunder), and to repay $500 million of outstanding borrowings under its $2.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company is filing the Fourth Supplemental Indenture as Exhibit 4.1 to this report. By filing this report, the Company is causing exhibit 4.1 to this report to be incorporated by reference herein.  

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, which rank equally with all existing and future senior indebtedness, including the Company’s obligations under its $5.5 billion senior unsecured credit facility, and senior to all future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Notes will effectively rank junior to all of the Company’s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of the Company’s subsidiaries. The 2021 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 3.400% per annum, and the 2026 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.450% per annum, both payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, to persons who are registered holders of the Notes on the immediately preceding February 1 and August 1, beginning on August 15, 2016.  

The Indenture limits the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur certain liens and merge with or into other companies, in each case subject to certain exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Indenture.  

In the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of such repurchase.  

The 2021 Notes will mature on February 15, 2021, and the 2026 Notes will mature on February 15, 2026. However, the Company, at its option, may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time prior to their maturity. If the Company elects to redeem the 2021 Notes prior to January 15, 2021 (the date that is one month prior to their maturity date), or the 2026 Notes prior to November 15, 2025 (the date that is three months prior to their maturity date), the Company will pay a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus a “make-whole” premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If the Company elects to redeem the 2021 Notes on or after January 15, 2021 (the date that is one month prior to their maturity date), or the 2026 Notes on or after November 15, 2025 (the date that is three months prior to their maturity date), the Company will pay a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.  

The above description of the Indenture does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties’ rights and obligations under the Indenture and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Base Indenture and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1.
