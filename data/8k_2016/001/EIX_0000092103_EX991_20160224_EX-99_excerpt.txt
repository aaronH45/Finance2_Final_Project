February 24, 2016 29 Tax Repair Accounting • As a result of the rate base offset, SCE wrote down $382 million of regulatory assets associated with deferred income taxes related to 2012-2014 incremental tax repair deductions  Because this rate base offset will be implemented at SCE through the regulatory asset write down, no rate base offset is needed for future earnings forecasts • Any differences between the forecasted tax repair deductions and actual repair deductions for 2015-2017 will be adjusted annually through customer rates On November 5, 2015, the CPUC issued a final decision supportive of SCE strategy to increase infrastructure reliability and safety investment while mitigating customer rate impacts through productivity and operating efficiency GRC Final Decision 2015 2016 2017 Revenue Requirement $5.182 $5.391 $5.663 Authorized Rate Base $17.3761 $18.7141 $20.1761 ($ billions) 2015 General Rate Case Final Decision 1. The final decision included a rate base offset for tax repair deductions. For accounting purposes, EIX has not included the rate base offset in its rate base forecast. See language above. Tax Repair Ratemaking • In SCE’s 2015 GRC final decision, the CPUC adopted a rate base offset associated with incremental tax repair deductions during 2012-2014 – In 2015, the CPUC rate base offset is $324 million1 and amortizes on a straight line basis over 27 years Exhibit 99.1  

February 24, 2016 30 SCE Tax Memorandum Account • 2015 GRC decision established tax accounting memorandum account (TAMA), which tracks 2015 – 2017 tax benefits or costs associated with following events: - changes in tax accounting methods - changes in tax laws and regulations impacting depreciation or tax repair - changes in forecasted tax repairs deductions (actual vs. amounts authorized) - changes to depreciation or tax repair deductions as a result of an audit - any impact of a private letter ruling related to normalization • Once a year, the aggregate over or undercollection will be calculated and transferred back to or collected from customers • $212 million regulatory liability at December 31, 2015 Tax Repair Deductions Bonus Depreciation • No earnings impact associated with incremental tax repair deductions (positive or negative) • No rate base impact (positive or negative) • Flow through rate making applies • Earnings impacts occurs in the relevant year of the extension rather than next GRC cycle • Rate base impact from increase in deferred taxes offset by an increase in working cash mainly in 2015 • Normalization rate making applies Tax Policy Rate Base and Earnings Implications Exhibit 99.1

SCE Net Energy Metering Statistics (December 2015): • 159,078 combined residential and non-residential projects – 1,245 MW installed (of 2,240 MW cap) – 99.7% solar – 154,756 residential – 794.3 MW (3.58% penetration) – 4,322 non-residential – 450.3 MW (0.62% penetration) • Approximately 2,231,929 MWh/year generated Exhibit 99.1  

February 24, 2016 36 In January 2016, the Commission Voted (3-2) to adopt a successor to the existing NEM tariff. The Successor Tariff largely maintains the current NEM tariff structure with following adjustments: • NEM customers will be required to take service under mandatory Time-of-Use (TOU) rates as soon as the successor tariff goes into effect (either July 1, 2017, or earlier if SCE reaches its 5% NEM capacity cap). • NEM customers will be assessed some nonbypassable charges (NBCs) equating to about 1.5-2 cents/kWh charged on all delivered energy from the electric grid (regardless of netting). • NEM customers will be assessed a cost-based interconnection fee ($75 for SCE customers) to interconnect their solar PV systems. Commission will revisit the NEM successor tariff in 2019, after better information becomes available regarding benefits of solar. A second phase of the NEM proceeding will focus on the development of alternatives to grow rooftop solar in Disadvantaged Communities. NEM Successor Tariff Decision Exhibit 99.1

February 24, 2016 50 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States. Management uses core earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings are also used when communicating with investors and analysts regarding Edison International's earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. Core earnings are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings (or losses) are defined as earnings or losses attributable to Edison International shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as: exit activities, including sale of certain assets, and other activities that are no longer continuing; asset impairments and certain tax, regulatory or legal settlements or proceedings.
