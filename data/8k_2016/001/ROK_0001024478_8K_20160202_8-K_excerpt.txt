INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT  

 Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

On February 2, 2016, our shareowners approved an amendment to the Rockwell Automation, Inc. 2012 Long-Term Incentives Plan described in our proxy statement dated December 14, 2015 (the LTIP Amendment). Our Board of Directors adopted the LTIP Amendment on November 4, 2015, subject to approval by shareowners. Our 2012 Long-Term Incentives Plan (the 2012 Plan) was originally adopted by our Board of Directors on November 2, 2011 and approved by our shareowners on February 7, 2012. The 2012 Plan (as amended by the LTIP Amendment, the Amended 2012 Plan) is described in our proxy statement dated December 14, 2015 for the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareowners.  

The LTIP Amendment increases the maximum number of shares of common stock available for delivery by 5 million shares.  

The Amended 2012 Plan permits the grant of a variety of awards to employees (including our named executive officers) and prospective employees, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and performance shares. The number of shares authorized for delivery under the original 2012 Plan is 6,800,000. The Amended 2012 Plan increases the aggregate number by 5 million shares. No awards may be granted under the Amended 2012 Plan after February 7, 2022.  

The above description of the Amended 2012 Plan is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended 2012 Plan, a copy of which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated herein by reference.
