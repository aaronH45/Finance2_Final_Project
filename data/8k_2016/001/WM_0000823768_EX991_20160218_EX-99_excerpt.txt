• Operating expenses improved by $143 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year period. Excluding divestitures, operating expenses improved $50 million.(b) Lower fuel, lower commodity rebates, and continued route optimization drove the improvement.

(b) The Company had $145 million of pre-tax divestiture proceeds in 2015. 

• The Company paid dividends of $172 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter. For the full year, the Company returned almost $1.3 billion to shareholders through $695 million in dividends and $600 million in share repurchases.

2016 OUTLOOK 

The Company announced the following with regard to its financial outlook for 2016: 

• Adjusted earnings per diluted share are expected to be between $2.74 and $2.79. (b) 

• Recently completed acquisitions and tuck-in acquisitions expected to close in 2016 are estimated to generate between $50 and $75 million of operating EBITDA, although there will be no material benefit to earnings per diluted share in 2016 as first year non-cash amortization will offset the operating EBITDA contribution. Total operating EBITDA is expected to be approximately $3.6 billion for the full year, a 5% increase from 2015.(b) 

• Free cash flow for 2016 is projected to be between $1.5 and $1.6 billion.(b)  

• Core price is expected to be approximately 4.0% for 2016.(d) Internal revenue growth from yield on the collection and disposal business is expected to be between 1.5% and 2.0%. 

• Internal revenue growth from volume in the Company’s traditional solid waste business is expected to be positive in 2016. However, the Company does not expect a recovery in lower margin recycling or non-solid waste volumes. Consequently, the Company anticipates overall volumes to be about flat; with volumes in the first half of the year being slightly negative, and volumes turning positive in the second half of the year. 

• Recycling operations are expected to have no year-over-year impact on earnings per diluted share in 2016. 

• SG&A expenses are expected to be flat on a dollar basis for the full year. 

• The tax rate is expected to be about 35.0%. 

• Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $1.3 to $1.4 billion. 

• The Board of Directors has indicated its intention to increase the dividend by $0.10 to $1.64 per share on an annual basis, for an approximate annual cost of $730 million. The Board must separately declare each dividend. 

• The Company expects to repurchase up to $1 billion of common stock. 

Steiner continued, “2015 was a very successful year for Waste Management. We met or exceeded the goals that we established at the beginning of the year, and that led us to exceed our original full year adjusted earnings per share guidance. Free cash flow was also on pace to exceed our original guidance, and as a result, we applied some of that excess toward 2016 cash taxes. Our strong free cash flow allowed us to return almost $1.3 billion to our shareholders. Moreover, in 2015 we spent more than $500 million on acquisitions that we expect to generate significant cash flow in 2016. Based upon the strength in our cash generation, our Board of Directors raised our dividend by more than 6% and authorized $1 billion of share repurchases. 

“In 2016 we expect to continue the progress that we made in 2015 by continuing to execute on our pricing, disciplined growth, and cost control strategies, while integrating recently acquired businesses. This should position us to achieve approximately $3.6 billion of operating EBITDA(b), and to produce solid earnings and cash generation. In 2016, we will also continue to return significant cash to our shareholders, and we have already spent $150 million on share repurchases in the first quarter.” 

Steiner concluded, “We commend our field and corporate staff teams for the great results in 2015. Their focus and execution has positioned our company well for continued growth in 2016 and beyond.”     

(a) For purposes of this press release, all references to “Net loss” and “Net income” refer to the financial statement line items “Net income (loss) attributable to Waste Management, Inc.” and “Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.,” respectively. 

(b) This press release contains a discussion of non-GAAP measures, as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company reports its financial results in compliance with GAAP, but believes that also discussing non-GAAP measures provides investors with (i) additional, meaningful comparisons of current results to prior periods’ results by excluding items that the Company does not believe reflect its fundamental business performance and are not representative or indicative of its results of operations and (ii) financial measures the Company uses in the management of its business. Accordingly, net income, earnings per diluted share and effective tax rate, and comparisons to 2014 operating expenses and SG&A expenses, have been presented in certain instances excluding items identified in the reconciliations provided. 

The Company’s projected full year 2016 earnings per diluted share and operating EBITDA are anticipated to be adjusted to exclude the effects of events or circumstances in 2016 that are not representative or indicative of the Company’s results of operations. Projected GAAP earnings per diluted share and operating EBITDA (as defined in note (c) below) for the full year would require inclusion of the projected impact of future excluded items, including items that are not currently determinable, but may be significant, such as asset impairments and one-time items, charges, gains or losses from divestitures or litigation, or other items. Due to the uncertainty of the likelihood, amount and timing of any such items, the Company does not have information available to provide a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted projected full year earnings per diluted share, projected earnings growth, adjusted projected operating EBITDA, or projected operating EBITDA growth to the comparable GAAP measure. 

The Company also discusses free cash flow and provides projections of free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure. The company discusses free cash flow because the Company believes that it is indicative of its ability to pay its quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay its debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace “Net cash provided by operating activities,” which is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure. However, the Company believes free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how the Company views its liquidity. Nevertheless, the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. The Company defines free cash flow as: 

• Net cash provided by operating activities 

• Less, capital expenditures 

• Plus, proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested). 

The Company’s definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and therefore is not subject to comparison. 

The quantitative reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used herein to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the accompanying schedules, with the exception of projected earnings per diluted share and projected operating EBITDA. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, and investors are urged to take into account GAAP measures as well as non-GAAP measures in evaluating the Company. 

(c) The Company defines operating EBITDA as income from operations before depreciation and amortization; this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

(d) Core price is a performance metric used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of our pricing strategies; it is not derived from our financial statements and may not be comparable to measures presented by other companies. Core price is based on certain historical assumptions, which may differ from actual results, to allow for comparability between reporting periods and to reveal trends in results over time. 

The Company will host a conference call at 10:00 AM (Eastern) today to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. Information contained within this press release will be referenced and should be considered in conjunction with the call.
