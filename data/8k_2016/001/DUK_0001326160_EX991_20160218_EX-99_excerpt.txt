Duke Energy reports 2015 adjusted EPS and introduces 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range  

   •   Company achieves adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.54 in 2015, compared to $4.55 in 2014; reported diluted EPS of $4.05 for 2015, compared to $2.66 in 2014  

   •   Record mild December weather results in fourth quarter 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of 87 cents, compared to 86 cents for the fourth quarter 2014; fourth quarter 2015 reported diluted EPS of 69 cents, compared to 14 cents in 2014  

   •   Company establishes 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70  

CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Duke Energy today announced 2015 full-year adjusted diluted EPS of $4.54 compared to $4.55 in 2014. Duke Energy’s full-year 2015 reported diluted EPS was $4.05, compared to $2.66 in 2014.  

Full year adjusted results were driven by strong operational performance in the regulated business as well as benefits from closing certain strategic initiatives earlier than anticipated, helping offset weakness at International.  

Fourth quarter 2015 adjusted diluted EPS was 87 cents, compared to 86 cents for fourth quarter 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 reported diluted EPS was 69 cents, compared to 14 cents for fourth quarter 2014.  

Fourth quarter adjusted results were supported by increased retail pricing and wholesale margins in the regulated business, helping to offset the impact of record mild December weather in the Carolinas.  

Reported diluted EPS includes the impact of special items, which are excluded from adjusted diluted EPS. Special items during 2015 principally included charges associated with a settlement in Indiana related to the ongoing Edwardsport IGCC regulatory proceedings, severance related to cost savings initiatives, and merger costs-to-achieve.  

 Duke Energy News Release    2  

Special items during 2014 principally included charges related to the company’s intent to repatriate $2.7 billion of foreign earnings, a settlement resolving the federal grand jury investigation into the company’s coal ash basin operations, and merger costs-to-achieve.  

“I am pleased with our strong execution at the regulated utilities during 2015, underpinned by exceptional operational performance,” said Lynn Good, chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The dedication by our employees helped us meet growing customer peak demand as well as achieve industry-leading safety performance during the year.  

“We also successfully completed several strategic transactions, increasing our focus on our core regulated and highly contracted businesses. This focus positions us for evolving customer expectations and a desire for lower carbon, more flexible generation resources while supporting greater stability in earnings and cash flows for our investors,” Good said.  

The company has established its 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range at $4.50 to $4.70.  

Business unit results  

In addition to the summary business unit discussion below, comprehensive tables of quarterly and year-to-date adjusted earnings per share drivers compared to the prior year are provided on pages 17 and 18.  

The discussion below of fourth-quarter and full-year results includes adjusted segment income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The tables on pages 27 through 30 present a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results. Per share segment variances highlighted below exclude the benefit of the $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase program that was completed in June.  

Regulated Utilities  

Regulated Utilities recognized fourth quarter 2015 adjusted segment income of $601 million, compared to $551 million in the fourth quarter 2014, an increase of 7 cents per share. These results were driven by:  

   •   Increased pricing and riders (+$0.09 per share) as a result of increased riders, including a favorable Ohio energy efficiency settlement  

   •   Higher wholesale net margins (+$0.05 per share) due to new and updated contracts, including earnings from the long-term wholesale contract associated with the recent North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency (NCEMPA) asset purchase  

   •   Increased weather-normal retail volumes (+$0.04 per share)  

 Duke Energy News Release    3  

These favorable drivers were partially offset by:  

   •   Record breaking mild winter weather (-$0.12 per share), principally in the Carolinas and Midwest  

Full-year 2015 adjusted segment income for Regulated Utilities was $2,972 million, compared to $2,897 million in 2014, an increase of 10 cents per share.  

Increased year-to-date results at Regulated Utilities were primarily driven by:  

   •   Higher revenues from increased pricing and riders (+$0.23 per share) due to increased energy efficiency programs and fuel and purchased power cost true-ups  

   •   Increased wholesale net margins (+$0.16 per share) due to new and updated contracts including earnings from the long-term wholesale contract associated with the recent NCEMPA asset purchase  

   •   Increased weather-normal retail volumes (+$0.07 per share) of 0.6 percent compared to the prior year  

These favorable drivers were partially offset by:  

   •   Higher O&M expense (-$0.18 per share) due to higher planned outages, increased costs related to the recent NCEMPA asset purchase and nuclear outage cost levelization. These costs were partially offset by lower storm costs  

   •   Higher depreciation and amortization expense (-$0.13 per share) primarily resulting from additional plant in-service, including the NCEMPA assets  

International Energy  

International Energy recognized fourth quarter 2015 adjusted segment income of $68 million, compared to $72 million in the fourth quarter 2014, which was flat on a per share basis. These results were driven by:  

   •   Lower margins at National Methanol (-$0.03 per share) due to lower MTBE and methanol prices  

These unfavorable drivers were partially offset by:  

   •   Stronger results in Brazil (+$0.02 per share) due to lower purchased power costs partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates  

Full-year 2015 adjusted segment income for International Energy was $225 million, compared to $428 million in 2014, a decrease of 29 cents per share.  

 Duke Energy News Release    4  

International Energy’s lower year-to-date adjusted earnings were driven by:  

   •   Weaker results in Brazil (-$0.10 per share) primarily due to lower sales volumes and higher purchased power costs resulting from ongoing drought conditions and decreased demand in Brazil as well as unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates  

   •   Lower results in Central America (-$0.04 per share) primarily due to lower generation and prices from increased competition  

   •   Absence of a prior-year tax benefit in Chile (-$0.07 per share)  

   •   Lower margins at National Methanol (-$0.07 per share) largely driven by lower MTBE and methanol prices  

Commercial Portfolio  

Subsequent to the sale of its nonregulated Midwest Commercial Generation Business to Dynegy Inc. in April 2015, Commercial Portfolio (formerly Commercial Power) includes Duke Energy’s unregulated renewable assets as well as its commercial electric and gas transmission investments.  

Commercial Portfolio recognized fourth quarter 2015 adjusted segment income of $41 million, compared to $32 million in the fourth quarter 2014, an increase of 1 cent per share. The increase in Commercial Portfolio’s quarterly earnings was primarily due to additional in-service wind and solar facilities in the renewables portfolio (+$0.03 per share), offset by the absence of earnings from the Midwest generation business (-$0.01 per share), which was sold in April.  

Full-year 2015 adjusted segment income for Commercial Portfolio was $140 million, compared to $109 million in 2014, an increase of 4 cents per share. This increase was primarily due to higher results from the Midwest generation business (+$0.04 per share), which was sold in April, and increased earnings from the renewables portfolio due to additional in-service wind and solar facilities despite lower wind resources during the year (+$0.01 per share).  

Other  

On an adjusted basis, Other primarily includes corporate interest expense not allocated to the business units, results from Duke Energy’s captive insurance company, other investments, and quarterly income tax levelization adjustments.  

Other recognized a fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net expense of $108 million, compared to net expense of $45 million in the fourth quarter 2014, additional expense of 9 cents per share. Other’s quarterly results were primarily driven by higher income tax expense (-$0.07 per share) due to impacts from the extension of bonus depreciation and quarterly tax levelization adjustments, including renewable tax credits which were allocated to Commercial Portfolio upon completion of the projects.  

 Duke Energy News Release    5  

On a year-to-date basis, Other recognized adjusted net expense of $185 million, compared to $216 million for 2014, an improvement of 5 cents per share. Other’s year-to-date results were primarily driven by favorable income taxes (+$0.07 per share) due to favorable tax structuring and settlements.  

On a consolidated basis, the company experienced a fourth-quarter 2015 adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 31 percent, compared to approximately 30 percent in the prior year. The company experienced an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 32 percent for full-year 2015, consistent with the rate in 2014. Adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure. The tables on pages 31 and 32 present a reconciliation of reported effective tax rate to adjusted effective tax rate.  

Accelerated stock repurchase program  

In connection with the transaction to sell the Midwest Generation business to Dynegy for $2.8 billion, which closed in April 2015, Duke Energy completed a $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase (ASR). The ASR resulted in retirements of approximately 19.8 million shares, providing a benefit to the fourth quarter 2015 and year-to-date results of approximately 2 cents per share and 9 cents per share, respectively.

Non-GAAP financial measures  

Management evaluates financial performance in part based on the non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS). These items are measured as income from continuing operations net of income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, adjusted for the dollar and per-share impact of mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Portfolio segment and special items including the operating results of the Midwest Generation business (Disposal Group) classified as discontinued operations for GAAP purposes. Special items represent certain charges and credits, which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis, although it is reasonably possible such charges and credits could recur. Operating results of the Disposal Group sold to Dynegy are reported as discontinued operations, including a portion of the mark-to-market adjustments associated with derivative contracts. Management believes that including the operating results of the Disposal Group reported as discontinued operations better reflects its financial performance and therefore has included these results in adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS prior to the sale of the Disposal Group. Additionally, as a result of  

 Duke Energy News Release    8  

 completing the sale of the Disposal Group during the second quarter of 2015, state income tax expense increased as state income tax apportionments changed. The additional tax expense was recognized in Continuing Operations on a GAAP basis. This impact to state income taxes has been reflected in Discontinued Operations in the Commercial Portfolio segment for adjusted diluted EPS purposes as management believes these impacts are incidental to the sale of the Disposal Group. Derivative contracts are used in Duke Energy’s hedging of a portion of the economic value of its generation assets in the Commercial Portfolio segment. The mark-to-market impact of derivative contracts is recognized in GAAP earnings immediately and, if associated with the Disposal Group, classified as discontinued operations, as such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory treatment. The economic value of generation assets is subject to fluctuations in fair value due to market price volatility of input and output commodities (e.g. coal, electricity, natural gas). Economic hedging involves both purchases and sales of those input and output commodities related to generation assets. Operations of the generation assets are accounted for under the accrual method. Management believes excluding impacts of mark-to-market changes of the derivative contracts from adjusted earnings until settlement better matches the financial impacts of the derivative contract with the portion of economic value of the underlying hedged asset. Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy’s performance across periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting and for reporting results to the Board of Directors, employees, shareholders, analysts and investors concerning Duke Energy’s financial performance. Adjusted diluted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted EPS are Net Income Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation and Diluted EPS Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation common shareholders, which include the dollar and per share impact of special items, mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Portfolio segment and discontinued operations.  

Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to non-controlling interests. Segment income, as discussed below, includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management also uses adjusted segment income as a measure of historical and anticipated future segment performance. Adjusted segment income is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it is based upon segment income adjusted for the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Portfolio segment and special items, including the operating results of the Disposal Group classified as discontinued operations for GAAP purposes. Management believes the presentation of adjusted segment income as presented provides useful information to investors, as it provides  

 Duke Energy News Release    9  

them with an additional relevant comparison of a segment’s performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted segment income is segment income, which represents segment income from continuing operations, including any special items and the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Portfolio segment.  

Due to the forward-looking nature of any forecasted adjusted earnings guidance, information to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as management is unable to project all special items or mark-to-market adjustments for future periods.  

Due to the forward-looking nature of any forecasted adjusted segment income or adjusted Other net expenses and any related growth rates for future periods, information to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not available at this time, as the company is unable to forecast all special items, the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges in the Commercial Portfolio segment, or any amounts that may be reported as discontinued operations or extraordinary items for future periods.

 * Mark-to-market adjustments reflect the impact of derivative contracts, which are used in Duke Energy’s hedging of a portion of the economic value of its generation assets in the Commercial Portfolio segment and also relate to existing derivative positions that may have tenors beyond the planned disposal date of the nonregulated Midwest generation business. The mark-to-market impact of derivative contracts is recognized in GAAP earnings immediately as such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory treatment. The economic value of generation assets is subject to fluctuations in fair value due to market price volatility of input and output commodities (e.g. coal, electricity, natural gas). Economic hedging involves both purchases and sales of those input and output commodities related to generation assets. Operations of the generation assets are accounted for under the accrual method. Management believes excluding impacts of mark-to-market changes of the derivative contracts from adjusted earnings until settlement better matches the financial impacts of the derivative contract with the portion of economic value of the underlying hedged asset. However, due to the divestiture of the nonregulated Midwest generation business as mentioned above, certain derivative positions have tenors beyond the planned disposal date of these assets. As such, management has excluded settlements of these derivative positions from adjusted diluted EPS as these realized gains and losses more closely relate to the loss on disposal of these assets. Management believes that the presentation of adjusted diluted EPS Attributable to Duke Energy Corporation provides useful information to investors, as it provides them an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy Corporation’s performance across periods.
