Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Information to Non-GAAP Financial Information  

American Airlines Group Inc. (the “Company”) is providing the reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors the ability to measure financial performance excluding special items, which is more indicative of the Company’s ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. The Company believes that the presentation of mainline and regional CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors because both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond the Company’s control. Management uses mainline and regional CASM excluding special items and fuel to evaluate the Company’s operating performance.

FOOTNOTES:  

 (1)  The 2015 fourth quarter mainline operating special items totaled a net charge of $441 million, which principally included $305 million of merger integration expenses related to information technology, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance, share-based compensation, fleet restructuring, re-branding of aircraft and airport facilities, relocation and training, as well as a $22 million charge for bankruptcy related items primarily consisting of fair value adjustments for bankruptcy settlement obligations. The 2015 twelve month period mainline operating special items totaled a net charge of $1.1 billion, which principally consisted of $1.0 billion of merger integration expenses as described above. In addition, the Company recorded a $38 million charge in connection with the dissolution of the Texas Aero Engine Services joint venture. These charges were offset in part by a $66 million credit related to proceeds received from a legal settlement and a $53 million credit for bankruptcy related items primarily consisting of fair value adjustments for bankruptcy settlement obligations.  

The 2014 fourth quarter mainline operating special items totaled a net charge of $466 million, which principally included $280 million of merger integration expenses related to information technology, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance and retention, share-based compensation, fleet restructuring, re-branding of aircraft and airport facilities, relocation and training. In addition, the Company recorded a net $116 million charge for bankruptcy related items principally consisting of fair value adjustments for bankruptcy settlement obligations as well as a $70 million charge related primarily to certain spare parts asset impairments. The 2014 twelve month period mainline operating special items totaled a net charge of $800 million, which principally included $810 million of merger integration expenses as described above. In addition, the Company recorded a net $81 million charge for bankruptcy related items principally consisting of fair value adjustments for bankruptcy settlement obligations, $164 million in other special charges, including an $81 million charge to revise prior estimates of certain aircraft residual values and other spare parts asset impairments, as well as $54 million in charges primarily relating to the buyout of certain aircraft leases. These charges were offset in part by a $309 million gain on the sale of slots at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.  

 (2)  The 2015 fourth quarter and twelve month period regional operating special items principally related to merger integration expenses.  

The 2014 fourth quarter regional operating special items totaled a net charge of $16 million, which principally included a $24 million charge due to a new pilot labor contract at the Company’s Envoy regional subsidiary, offset in part by an $8 million gain on the sale of certain spare parts. The 2014 twelve month period regional operating special items totaled a net charge of $24 million, which consisted primarily of the above charge and gain as well as $7 million of merger integration expenses.  

 (3)  The 2015 fourth quarter nonoperating special items totaled a net charge of $592 million related to a write off of all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by the Company due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela. The 2015 twelve month period nonoperating special items totaled a net charge of $594 million, which principally included a $592 million charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars as described above and $41 million in charges primarily related to non-cash write offs of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs associated with refinancing our secured term loan facilities, prepayments of certain aircraft financings and the purchase and subsequent remarketing of certain special facility revenue bonds. These charges were offset in part by a $22 million gain associated with the sale of an investment and a $17 million early debt extinguishment gain associated with the repayment of American’s AAdvantage loan with Citibank.  

The 2014 fourth quarter nonoperating special items totaled a net charge of $31 million primarily related to Venezuelan foreign currency losses. The 2014 twelve month period nonoperating special items totaled a net charge of $132 million, which principally included $56 million of early debt extinguishment costs primarily related to the prepayment of 7.50% senior secured notes and other indebtedness, a $43 million charge for Venezuelan foreign currency losses and $33 million of non-cash interest accretion on bankruptcy settlement obligations.  

 (4)  In connection with the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for the fourth quarter of 2015, management has determined that it is more likely than not that substantially all of its deferred tax assets, which include its NOLs, will be realized. Accordingly, the Company reversed $3.0 billion of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015. This resulted in a special $3.0 billion non-cash tax benefit for the 2015 fourth quarter and twelve month periods.  

During the 2014 fourth quarter, the Company recorded a special $6 million non-cash deferred income tax benefit related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the 2014 twelve month period, the Company sold its portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June 30, 2014. In connection with this sale, the Company recorded a special non-cash tax provision of $330 million in the second quarter of 2014 that reversed the non-cash tax provision which was recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI), a subset of stockholders’ equity, principally in 2009. This provision represents the tax effect associated with gains recorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a net increase in the fair value of the Company’s fuel hedging contracts. In accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the Company retained the $330 million tax provision in OCI until the last contract was settled or terminated. In addition, the 2014 twelve month period included a special $16 million non-cash deferred income tax provision related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets.
