Also beginning in 2016, the Company will provide to Mr. Munoz an annual long-term incentive award with a grant date value of at least $10,500,000, to be delivered through vehicles and designs that are generally consistent with those awarded to the Company’s other senior executive officers in each year, provided that Mr. Munoz shall not be eligible to receive such a grant for calendar 2016 until such date as he has been in continuous active service as President and Chief Executive Officer for a period of six months.

It is the expectation of Mr. Munoz and the Companies that Mr. Munoz will relocate to Chicago within eighteen months of the effective date of the Employment Agreement. 

· Additional Expenses. Mr. Munoz will be entitled to reimbursement for additional expenses related to his change in employment and relocation, including matters such as reasonable legal fees, tax planning, financial advisory services, home security and estate planning, up to a maximum of $75,000, which shall be paid in 2016.
