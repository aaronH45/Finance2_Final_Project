  (1) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Funds from operations would be increased by $217 and $795 for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and $781 and $3,033 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.   

  FFO is a widely accepted supplemental measure of REIT performance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT). Given the company’s business as a real estate owner and operator, Kimco believes that FFO and FFO as adjusted is helpful to investors as a measure of its operating performance. NAREIT defines FFO as net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, excluding (i) gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and change in control of interests and (ii) extraordinary items, plus (iii) depreciation and amortization of operating properties and (iv) impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments. Included in these items are also the company’s share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships. FFO as adjusted excludes the effects of non-operating impairments, transactional income and expenses.   

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  Combined Same Property NOI and U.S. Same Property NOI are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures of real estate companies’ operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. Combined Same Property NOI and U.S. Same Property NOI are considered by management to be important performance measures of Kimco's operations, and management believes that these measures are frequently used by securities analysts and investors as measures of Kimco's operating performance as these measures include only the net operating income of properties that have been owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods including those properties under redevelopment and exclude properties under development and pending stabilization. As such, Combined Same Property NOI and U.S. Same Property NOI assist in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular periods presented, and thus provide a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the operating performance of Kimco's properties.   

  Combined Same Property NOI (and U.S. Same Property NOI) is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rents, lease termination fees and above/below market rents and includes charges for bad debt) less operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes, rent expense and the impact for foreign currency, plus Kimco's proportionate share of Combined Same Property NOI from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. Combined Same Property NOI includes all properties that are owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods and excludes properties under development and properties pending stabilization. Properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following their inclusion in operating real estate. U.S. Same Property NOI excludes the company’s Canadian properties which are included in Combined Same Property NOI. Kimco’s method of calculating Combined Same Property NOI and U.S. Same Property NOI may differ from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.

  Projections involve numerous assumptions such as rental income (including assumptions on percentage rent), interest rates, tenant defaults, occupancy rates, foreign currency exchange rates (such as the US-Canadian rate), selling prices of properties held for disposition, expenses (including salaries and employee costs), insurance costs and numerous other factors. Not all of these factors are determinable at this time and actual results may vary from the projected results, and may be above or below the range indicated. The above range represents management’s estimate of results based upon these assumptions as of the date of this press release.
