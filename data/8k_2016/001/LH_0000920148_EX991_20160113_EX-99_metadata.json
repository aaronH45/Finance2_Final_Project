        "31 2) During the third quarter of 2014, the Company recorded net restructuring and special items of $5.8 million. The charges included $4.6 million in severance and other personnel costs along with $1.6 million in facility-related costs associated with facility closures and general integration initiatives. The Company reversed previously established reserves of $0.2 in unused severance and $0.2 million in unused facility-related costs. In addition, the Company recorded $5.5 million in consulting expenses relating to fees incurred as part of its comprehensive enterprise-wide cost structure review as well as legal fees associated with its LipoScience acquisition (all such fees recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). The after tax impact of these combined charges decreased net earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, by $7.0 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.08 ($7.0 million divided by 86.5 million shares). During the first two quarters of 2014, the Company recorded net restructuring and special items of $14.3 million. The charges included $5.3 million in severance and other personnel costs along with $5.0 million in costs associated with facility closures and general integration initiatives. The Company reversed previously established reserves of $0.2 million in unused severance and $0.5 million in unused facility-related costs. In addition, the Company recorded $4.7 million in consulting expenses (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses) relating to fees incurred as part of its comprehensive enterprise-wide cost structure review as well as one-time CFO transition costs. The after tax impact of these combined charges decreased net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, by $15.8 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.18 ($15.8 million divided by 86.5 million shares). 3) The Company continues to grow the business through acquisitions and uses Adjusted EPS Excluding Amortization as a measure of operational performance, growth and shareholder returns. The Company believes adjusting EPS for amortization provides investors with better insight into the operating performance of the business. For the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, intangible amortization was $47.1 million and $18.3 million, respectively ($32.9 million and $11.3 million net of tax, respectively) and decreased EPS by $0.31 ($32.9 million divided by 102.9 million shares) and $0.13 ($11.3 million divided by 86.5 million shares), respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, intangible amortization was $126.2 million and $61.3 million, respectively ($86.5 million and $37.8 million net of tax, respectively) and decreased EPS by $0.87 ($86.5 million divided by 99.7 million shares) and $0.44 ($37.8 million divided by 86.5 million shares), respectively. 4) During the first quarter of 2015, the Company's operating cash flows were reduced due to payment of $153.5 million in acquisition-related charges. These payments were comprised of $75.5 million in legal and advisor fees, $40.6 million in accelerated Covance employee equity awards, and $37.4 million in make- whole payments triggered by calling Covance private placement notes outstanding at the time of the transaction.
