FOURTH QUARTER 2015 FINANCIAL RESULTS:

Selected items impacting earnings

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During the fourth quarter, Regions corrected the accounting for certain leases which had previously been included in loans. These leases had been classified as capital leases but were subsequently determined to be operating leases. The cumulative effect on pre-tax income lowered net interest income and other financing income $15 million and reduced the net interest margin by 5 basis points in the quarter. The adjustment resulted in a reclassification of these leases out of loans into other earning assets totaling approximately $834 million at the end of the quarter. The company does not expect this adjustment to have a material impact to net interest income and other financing income or net interest margin in any future reporting period. 

Additionally, the company incurred $6 million of expenses during the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the consolidation of approximately 29 branches. The company also incurred $6 million of severance expense, primarily related to efficiency efforts as the company began executing its plan to eliminate $300 million in core expenses over the next three years.

Fourth quarter 2015 results compared to fourth quarter 2014:

•Ending loans and leases totaled $81 billion, an increase of $3.9 billion or 5 percent. Adjusted ending loans and leases(1) totaled $82 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion or 6 percent. 

◦Business lending balances increased 5 percent; excluding the lease reclassification, business lending balances increased 7 percent.

◦Consumer lending balances increased 5 percent; loan production increased 12 percent.

•Average deposit balances totaled $97 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion or 4 percent; average low-cost deposits increased 5 percent.

•Net interest income and other financing income was $836 million; an increase of $16 million or 2 percent, resulting in net interest margin of 3.08 percent. Excluding the lease adjustment, net interest income and other financing income amounted to $851 million; an increase of $31 million or 4 percent, and the resulting net interest margin was 3.13 percent.

•Non-interest income totaled $514 million, an increase of 8 percent or 9 percent on an adjusted basis(1). 

•Non-interest expenses were essentially flat on an adjusted basis(1).

•Net charge-offs declined 6 percent and represented 0.38 percent of average loans while non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, declined 6 percent.

Fourth quarter 2015 results compared to third quarter 2015:

•Ending loans and leases increased $933 million on an adjusted basis(1). 

◦Business lending balances remained relatively flat quarter over quarter. Excluding the lease reclassification, business lending balances increased 1 percent.

◦Consumer lending balances increased 1 percent.

•Average deposit balances totaled $97 billion, an increase of $322 million; low-cost deposits increased $614 million or 1 percent.

•Net interest income and other financing income was $836 million, or essentially flat. Excluding the $15 million lease adjustment, net interest income and other financing income increased $15 million or 2 percent. 

•Non-interest income increased 4 percent on an adjusted basis(1).

•Non-interest expenses decreased 4 percent on an adjusted basis(1).

•Net charge-offs increased 30 percent and non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, declined 1 percent. 

•The fully phased-in pro-forma Common Equity Tier 1 ratio(1)(2) was estimated at 10.7 percent and the loan-to-deposit ratio was 83 percent at December 31, 2015.

Total revenue

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]*Excluding the $15 million lease adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter 2015, net interest income and other financing income would have been $851 million or $871 million on an FTE basis and the net interest margin would have been 3.13 percent.

Total revenue was $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of $19 million or 1 percent on an adjusted basis(1) compared to the prior quarter. Net interest income and other financing income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $856 million, or essentially flat linked quarter. Excluding the $15 million lease adjustment, net interest income and other financing income increased 2 percent. The increase was driven primarily by loan growth, balance sheet hedging and optimization strategies and interest recoveries partially offset by fixed rate asset re-pricing. 

Non-interest income totaled $514 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 3 percent or 4 percent on an adjusted basis(1). The quarter-over-quarter improvement was driven primarily by gains on the sale of affordable housing investments and by higher card and ATM income. Card and ATM income increased 3 percent primarily related to an increase in commercial bank card usage and increased seasonal consumer spending. 

Service charges were impacted by posting order changes that went into effect in early November and reduced non-interest income by approximately $7 million. Wealth Management income was down slightly linked quarter due to lower insurance income partially offset by higher investment management and trust fee income. Capital markets income was relatively flat linked quarter as revenue from new product and service offerings was offset primarily by lower loan syndication fees.

Non-interest expense 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-interest expense totaled $873 million in the fourth quarter; however, on an adjusted basis(1) non-interest expense was $861 million and decreased 4 percent compared to the third quarter. FDIC insurance assessments decreased $24 million, primarily due to additional expenses in the third quarter related to prior assessments. A reduction in unfunded commitment expense resulted in a $12 million benefit in other expenses. Total salaries and benefits increased $8 million from the previous quarter, primarily attributable to $6 million in severance expenses. The company also incurred $6 million of expenses related to the consolidation of 29 branches. 

The adjusted efficiency ratio(1) was 63.4 percent. Excluding the $15 million lease adjustment, the resulting efficiency ratio(1) was 62.7 percent. Under the current operating environment with continued low interest rates, the company remains committed to disciplined expense management and is taking steps to improve efficiencies and lower costs.

Income taxes

The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29.3 percent. The effective rate for the quarter was positively impacted primarily by higher than expected benefits related to affordable housing investments. The effective tax rate is expected to be in the 30 to 32 percent range during 2016.

Loans and Leases

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Adjusting the December 31, 2015 ending balances of total commercial and business loan categories to include the impact of operating leases, loan and lease growth rates would have been 1.3% and 1.2%, respectively, compared to September 30, 2015, and 7.8% and 6.9%, respectively, compared to December 31, 2014. 

Total adjusted loans and leases were $82 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of $933 million or 1 

percent(1). Importantly, this growth occurred across most product lines and geographies. 

Excluding the lease reclassification, the business lending portfolio would have been $52 billion reflecting an increase of $599 million or 1 percent. This increase was driven by geography based commercial bankers, with almost 95 percent of the company's market areas achieving growth. Specialized lending also contributed to loan growth, driven by franchise restaurant and technology and defense. Total commercial loans increased $563 million or 1 percent, excluding the lease reclassification. Investor real estate loans increased modestly. Commitments increased 2 percent and commercial line utilization increased 30 basis points to 46.3 percent from the previous quarter.

The consumer lending portfolio experienced growth in every product category, increasing $334 million or 1 percent from the prior quarter. Residential first mortgage balances increased $81 million or 1 percent and home equity balances increased $31 million as new production continues to out-pace run-off. Indirect-vehicle lending continued to expand as balances increased $89 million or 2 percent from the previous quarter. Indirect-other increased $55 million or 11 percent as the company continues to successfully expand its point-of-sale initiatives. Additionally, consumer credit card balances increased $59 million or 6 percent as active credit cards increased 4 percent and the company's penetration rate of existing customers increased 160 basis points over the year to approximately 17.3 percent.

Deposits

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total average deposit balances increased $322 million from the prior quarter. Average low-cost deposits increased $614 million in the quarter and represented 92 percent of average deposits in the fourth quarter, reflecting the company's solid funding base. Deposit costs remained near historical lows at 11 basis points and total funding costs were 26 basis points for the fourth quarter.

Asset quality

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Business services represents the combined total of commercial and investor real estate loans.

~ ALL excludes operating leases

Net charge-offs totaled $78 million, an increase of $18 million from the previous quarter primarily related to one energy loan. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans was 0.38 percent. The provision for loan losses was $69 million and the resulting allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.36 percent of total loans outstanding at the end of the quarter. 

Total non-accrual loans (excluding loans held for sale) declined $7 million and represented 0.96 percent of total loans, while troubled debt restructured loans declined 1 percent. Total business services criticized and classified loans increased 4 percent, which was driven by some weakening in a small number of larger loans, primarily within the energy portfolio. Given the current phase of the credit cycle, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected, especially related to large-dollar commercial credits and fluctuating commodity prices.

Capital and liquidity

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Under the Basel III capital rules, Regions’ estimated ratios remain well above current regulatory requirements. The Tier 1(2)(3)(4) and Common Equity Tier 1(2) ratios were estimated at 11.7 percent and 10.9 percent, respectively, at quarter-end under the phase-in provisions. In addition, the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio(1)(2)(3) was estimated at 10.7 percent on a fully phased-in basis. 

During the fourth quarter, the company repurchased $78 million or 8 million shares of common stock. In addition, the company declared $78 million in dividends to common shareholders. 

The company’s loan-to-deposit ratio at the end of the quarter was 83 percent. Additionally, as of period-end the company was fully compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio rule.

Use of non-GAAP financial measures

 Management uses the adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) and the adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP) to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the fee income ratio. Net interest income and other financing income on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the fee income and efficiency ratios. Regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions’ business. It is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur; however, management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.

Tangible common stockholders’ equity ratios have become a focus of some investors and management believes they may assist investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions’ capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders’ equity measure. Because tangible common stockholders’ equity is not formally defined by GAAP or prescribed in any amount by federal banking regulations it is currently considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions’ disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions’ capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders’ equity, management believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions’ capital adequacy on this same basis.

The calculation of the fully phased-in pro-forma "Common equity Tier 1" (CET1) is based on Regions’ understanding of the Final Basel III requirements. For Regions, the Basel III framework became effective on a phased-in approach starting in 2015 with full implementation beginning in 2019. The calculation includes estimated pro-forma amounts for the ratio on a fully phased-in basis. Regions’ current understanding of the final framework includes certain assumptions, including the Company’s interpretation of the requirements, and informal feedback received through the regulatory process. Regions’ understanding of the framework is evolving and will likely change as analysis and discussions with regulators continue. Because Regions is not currently subject to the fully-phased in capital rules, this pro-forma measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure, and other entities may calculate it differently from Regions’ disclosed calculation. 

A company's regulatory capital is often expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Under the risk-based capital framework, a company’s balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories. The aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the prescribed risk-weighted percentage. The resulting weighted values from each of the categories are added together and this sum is 

the risk-weighted assets total that, as adjusted, comprises the denominator of certain risk-based capital ratios. CET1 capital is then divided by this denominator (risk-weighted assets) to determine the CET1 capital ratio. The amounts disclosed as risk-weighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements on a fully phased-in basis.

During the fourth quarter 2015, Regions corrected the accounting for certain leases which had previously been included in loans. These leases had been classified as capital leases but were subsequently determined to be operating leases. The adjustment resulted in a reclassification of these leases out of loans into other earning assets. Regions believes including the impact of the operating leases, reported as capital leases prior to the fourth quarter of 2015, provides a meaningful calculation of loan and lease growth rates and presents them on the same basis as that applied by management. Total loans (GAAP) is presented including the lease adjustment to arrive at adjusted total loans and leases (non-GAAP). 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders.

Management and the Board of Directors utilize non-GAAP measures as follows:

•Preparation of Regions' operating budgets

•Monthly financial performance reporting

•Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)

•Presentation to investors of company performance
