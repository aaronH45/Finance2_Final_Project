Item 2.06Material Impairments

On January 15, 2016, Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (the “Company”) provided notice (“Notice of Intention”) to Woolworths Limited, its joint venture partner in Australia, of the Company’s intent to exercise its put option with respect to its investment in the joint venture, which operates Masters Home Improvement stores and Home Timber and Hardware Group’s retail stores and wholesale distribution in Australia. Following a period of 390 days, the shares which are the subject of the put option will be sold. However, Woolworths may bring forward the date of the sale during this period, by the exercise of its call option. The purchase price will be determined by reference to the fair market value of the shares, as of Monday, January 18, 2016. The valuation process will commence immediately. In connection with the planned divestiture, the Company expects to record, in its fourth quarter ending January 29, 2016, a non-cash impairment charge, subject to adjustment based on the final outcome of the valuation process. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate in good faith the amount or range of amounts of the impairment charge. However, the Company believes the valuation process referenced above will provide a reasonable estimate of such amounts for inclusion in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company expects to file an amended Current Report on Form 8-K under this Item 2.06 within four business days after the date upon which it makes a determination of an estimate or range of estimates for any such impairment charge.

A copy of the press release announcing the Company’s plan to exit from the joint venture is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
