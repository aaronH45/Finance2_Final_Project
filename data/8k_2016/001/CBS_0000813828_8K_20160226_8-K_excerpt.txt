Item 5.02Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. 

(e) On February 26, 2016, CBS Corporation (“CBS” or the “Company”) entered into a letter agreement (the “Amendment”) with Leslie Moonves, the Company’s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, which amends Mr. Moonves’ employment agreement dated December 11, 2014, as amended February 24, 2015 (the “Agreement”). The Amendment provides that Mr. Moonves will be eligible to receive an additional grant of shares of the Company’s Class B common stock following the expiration of the employment term on June 30, 2019 (the “2016 Performance Award”). Subject to a minimum performance threshold, the number of shares to be delivered to Mr. Moonves in respect of the 2016 Performance Award will range from 148,258 to 436,622 shares based on the stock price performance of the Class B common stock during the period beginning February 18, 2016 and ending June 30, 2019 (the “Performance Period”), as adjusted based on the Company’s achievement of established performance goals for calendar years 2017 and 2018, and will be subject to proration in the event of Mr. Moonves’ death or disability during the employment term. The stock price performance will be determined using the tenth highest closing price of the Class B common stock during the Performance Period, expressed as a percentage of the closing price of the Class B common stock on February 18, 2016. In the event CBS ceases to be a “publicly traded company” (as defined in the Agreement) during the employment term, the Performance Period may be shortened and the grant of shares in satisfaction of the 2016 Performance Award may be made earlier. In addition, the Amendment also revised certain provisions of the Agreement to reflect Mr. Moonves’ appointment and role as Chairman of the Board. The provisions of the Agreement related to Mr. Moonves’ annual compensation (including equity) and severance amounts remain unchanged.
