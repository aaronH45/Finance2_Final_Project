QUANTA SERVICES REPORTS 2015 FOURTH QUARTER AND ANNUAL RESULTS  

Revenues of $1.90 Billion  

Diluted Loss Per Share from Continuing Operations of $0.02 Includes $0.25 of Net Impairment Charges  

Non-GAAP Adjusted Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations of $0.30  

HOUSTON – Feb. 25, 2016 - Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR) today announced results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $1.90 billion compared to revenues of $2.03 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net loss from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $2.6 million, or a loss of $0.02 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $60.4 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) was $0.30 for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.48 for the fourth quarter of 2014.  

“Our adjusted fourth quarter results met our expectations, setting a positive tempo as we transition into a new year,” said Jim O’Neil, president and chief executive officer of Quanta Services. “We expect improved project execution and increasing mainline pipe activity to drive profitable growth and significantly contribute to our earnings in 2016. In addition, we continue to make necessary adjustments to operations in order to improve margins over time to historical performance levels. With our leadership position, customer relationships and strong balance sheet, we believe Quanta is uniquely positioned to serve the expanding needs of our customers in a complex, ever-changing energy infrastructure market.”  

Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2015 included $0.25 per diluted share of net impairment charges. These charges consisted of asset impairments of $58.5 million ($44.6 million net of tax), or $0.27 per diluted share, which primarily resulted from lower forecasted oil and gas services revenues for our Gulf of Mexico operations and certain operations in Australia, due to the extended low commodity price environment. These impacts were partially offset by tax benefits of $4.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, associated with the realization of a previously unrecognized deferred tax asset

 related to our investment in a foreign subsidiary. Also, the fourth quarter of 2014 reflected a net $0.15 reduction in diluted earnings per share for net charges, which are more fully described in the footnotes to the accompanying supplemental data and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.  

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $7.57 billion compared to revenues of $7.75 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $120.3 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $269.2 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) was $1.11 per diluted share for 2015 compared to $1.85 per diluted share for 2014. The years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included net charges which negatively impacted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and are more fully described in the footnotes to the accompanying supplemental data and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.  

Net loss attributable to common stock was $5.1 million, or a loss of $0.03 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2015. This compares to net income attributable to common stock in the fourth quarter of 2014 of $66.6 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. Net income attributable to common stock was $310.9 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2015, which included a net of tax gain of $171.0 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, from the sale of Quanta’s fiber optic licensing operations. This compares to $296.7 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2014.  

The adjusted diluted earnings per share measures used in this earnings release are calculated as GAAP diluted earnings per share before acquisition and integration costs, amortization of intangible assets and non-cash compensation expense, and certain other items that affect comparability of results between periods. See the attached table for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the reported GAAP measures.  

Quanta completed 11 acquisitions during 2015, one of which was completed during the fourth quarter. Therefore, the fourth quarter and 2015 year-end results include these acquisitions from the respective acquisition dates and are compared to the pre-acquisition historical results of Quanta for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2014.  

RECENT HIGHLIGHTS  

 •   Amended Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility - In December 2015, Quanta entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by Bank of America N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which increased the capacity under its senior secured revolving credit facility from $1.325 billion to $1.810 billion and extended the maturity date to December 18, 2020. The amended credit facility contains more favorable terms and provides additional flexibility for borrowings in foreign currencies. Quanta also has the option to increase the revolving commitments available under the facility by up to $400.0 million upon receipt of additional commitments from lenders.  

 •   Stock Repurchased - During the fourth quarter of 2015, Quanta repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares of common stock in the open market for approximately $76.8 million. During all of 2015, Quanta acquired approximately 59.3 million shares of its common stock for approximately $1.5 billion. In addition, Quanta estimates that under its accelerated share repurchase arrangement (the ASR), which was entered into in August 2015 and is currently expected to settle in April 2016, an additional 10 million shares of common stock could be retired.

OUTLOOK  

The long-term outlook for Quanta’s business is positive. However, weather, regulatory, permitting, project timing and other factors have impacted the company’s results in 2015, and may impact Quanta’s financial results in the future. Therefore, Quanta’s financial outlook for revenues, margins and earnings reflects management’s effort to properly align these uncertainties with the backlog the company is executing on and the opportunities expected to materialize during 2016. The following forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially.  

Quanta expects revenues for the full year 2016 to range between $7.5 billion and $8.0 billion and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be $1.30 to $1.50. Quanta expects adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (a non-GAAP measure) for the full year 2016 to be $1.58 to $1.78. These estimates reflect the estimated impact of the retirement of approximately 10 million shares currently anticipated to be delivered in April 2016 upon settlement of the ASR. Amortization of intangibles and non-cash stock-based compensation expense are forecasted to be approximately $29.1 million and $41.6 million for the full year of 2016.  

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The non-GAAP measures in this press release and on Quanta’s website are provided to enable investors, analysts and management to evaluate Quanta’s performance excluding the effects of certain items that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between reporting periods. In addition, management believes these measures are useful in comparing Quanta’s operating results with those of its competitors. These measures should be used in addition to, and not in lieu of, results prepared in conformity with GAAP. Reconciliations of other GAAP to non-GAAP measures not included in the table attached to this press release can be found on the company’s website at www.quantaservices.com in the “Investors & Media” section.

   For the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014    

   (Unaudited)     

Segment Results  

Quanta reports its results under two reporting segments: (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services and (2) Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services, as set forth below (in thousands, except percentages).  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Included in operating income for the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 is the impact of $19.3 million and $44.9 million of project losses related to a power plant project in Alaska. In addition, included in operating income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 are project losses of $21.2 million associated with an electric transmission project that was negatively impacted by adverse weather in the first and second quarters of 2015.  

 (b) Included in operating income for the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 is the impact of a property and equipment impairment charge of $6.6 million related to certain international renewable energy services operations.  

 (c) Included in operating income for the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014 is the impact of a $49.9 million and $102.5 million charge to provision for long-term contract receivable associated with a disputed change order on an electric power infrastructure services project that was settled in 2015.  

 (d) Included in operating income for the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 is the impact of project losses of approximately $7.3 million on a directional drilling project in Canada that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. Included in operating income for the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 is the impact of a $38.8 million expense associated with an adverse arbitration decision related to a contract dispute on a 2010 directional drilling project.  

 (e) Included in operating loss for Corporate and Non-Allocated Costs for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was the impact of $51.9 million in asset impairment charges associated with goodwill and intangible asset reductions, which primarily resulted from lower forecasted oil and gas services revenues for our Gulf of Mexico operations and certain operations in Australia, due to the extended low commodity price environment.  

Backlog  

Backlog is not a term recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); however, it is a common measurement used in the industry. Quanta’s methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies. Quanta’s backlog represents the amount of consolidated revenue that it expects to realize from future work under construction contracts, long-term maintenance contracts and master service agreements. These estimates include revenues from the remaining portion of firm orders not yet completed and on which work has not yet begun, as well as revenues from change orders, renewal options, and funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent that they are reasonably expected to occur. For purposes of calculating backlog, Quanta includes 100% of estimated revenues attributable to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities. The following table presents Quanta’s total backlog by reportable segment as of December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, along with an estimate of the backlog amounts expected to be realized within 12 months of each balance sheet date (in millions):

   (In thousands, except per share information)    

   (Unaudited)     

The non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is provided to enable investors to evaluate performance excluding the effects of items that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between periods. As to certain of the items below, (i) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta’s acquisition activity, which can cause these amounts to vary from period to period; (ii) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, factors influencing the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted during the period; (iii) acquisition and integration costs vary period to period depending on the level of Quanta’s acquisition activity ongoing during the period; (iv) income tax contingency releases vary period to period depending on the level of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the expiration dates under various federal and state statute of limitation periods; (v) charges to provision for long-term contract receivable can vary from period to period depending on management’s ongoing assessment of the recoverability of underlying assets; (vi) the expense associated with the arbitration decision is not a regularly occurring operational item; (vii) asset impairments can vary from period to period depending on economic and other factors; and (viii) cumulative revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities associated with an Alberta provincial income tax law change and the elimination of tax benefits associated with the realization of a previously unrecognized deferred tax asset related to our investment in a foreign subsidiary are not regularly occurring items.
