CBS CORPORATION REPORTS 2015 FOURTH QUARTER 

AND FULL YEAR RESULTS

Fourth Quarter Revenues Up 6% to an All-Time High of $3.9 Billion 

Fourth Quarter Adjusted EPS Up 19% to an All-Time High of $.92 

NEW YORK, February 11, 2016 - CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS.A and CBS) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015, including its highest-ever quarter in revenue and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share (“EPS”). 

“We had a terrific fourth quarter, and CBS is now in position to build strong momentum throughout 2016,” said Leslie Moonves, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, CBS Corporation. “Our base businesses are growing well, thanks to the strength of our premium content and the continued improvement in the advertising marketplace. In addition, with Super Bowl 50 here in the first quarter and political spending ramping up into the fourth, we expect 2016 will be a very good year for advertising. At the same time, our other high-margin revenue streams continue to thrive. Retransmission consent and reverse compensation are set to hit $1 billion in 2016 — a year earlier than expected — and are on pace to surpass $2 billion in 2020. The international market is extremely exciting as well, with demand for our CBS programming higher than ever and new deals that are changing the way we license the Showtime brand overseas. Plus, our new streaming services — CBS All Access, CBSN, and Showtime over the top — are attracting a whole new set of younger viewers on better economic terms. So no matter how quickly the digital world changes — and no matter how viewers want their content — CBS is positioned to succeed.” 

Fourth Quarter 2015 Results

Revenues of $3.91 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 were up 6% from $3.68 billion for the prior-year period. The growth was driven by a 16% increase in content licensing and distribution revenues, reflecting higher international television licensing sales. Affiliate and subscription fees grew 13%, driven by continued increases in retransmission revenues and fees from CBS Television Network affiliated stations. Advertising revenues increased 1%, led by 8% growth in network advertising, which was partially offset by the benefit to Local Broadcasting in 2014 from political revenues. 

Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $357 million, including a pretax noncash impairment charge of $484 million ($297 million, net of tax benefit) to reduce the carrying value of radio FCC licenses to their fair value and a gain from the sale of an Internet business in China of $120 million ($128 million, including tax benefit). On an adjusted basis, operating income of $747 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 grew 6% from operating income of $707 million from the same prior-year period, primarily reflecting the higher revenues. 

For the fourth quarter of 2015, net earnings from continuing operations was $251 million, or $.53 per diluted share, and included several discrete items that totaled $185 million, net of tax, or $.39 per diluted share. 

On an adjusted basis, net earnings from continuing operations were $436 million, an 8% increase from net earnings from continuing operations of $402 million for the same prior-year period, principally driven by the higher adjusted operating income. Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2015 grew 19%, to $.92, from EPS of $.77 for the same prior-year period. During the fourth quarter of 2015, weighted average shares outstanding were 474 million, down from 523 million in the prior-year period, as a result of the Company’s ongoing share repurchase program.

Adjusted results for the fourth quarter of 2015 excluded restructuring charges of $26 million ($16 million, net of tax benefit), and the above-mentioned impairment charge and gain from the sale of an Internet business in China. No adjustments were made to reported results for the fourth quarter of 2014.

Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to reported results are included at the end of this earnings release.

Full Year 2015 Results

Full year 2015 revenues were $13.89 billion, up 1% from $13.81 billion in 2014. The growth was driven by a 15% increase in affiliate and subscription fees, reflecting higher rates, as well as increased revenues from pay-per-view boxing events. Advertising revenues decreased 3%, reflecting a decline in local advertising revenues as a result of the benefit to 2014 from the midterm elections and lower radio advertising. Overall advertising revenues benefited from a 1% increase in network advertising, primarily driven by higher scatter pricing in the second half of the year, which offset the impact of broadcasting fewer sporting events on the CBS Television Network. Content licensing and distribution revenues were down 2%, reflecting lower domestic television licensing revenues, which were partially offset by higher international television licensing revenues.

For 2015, operating income of $2.42 billion included the previously mentioned impairment charge and gains from the sales of Internet businesses in China of $139 million. On an adjusted basis, operating income of $2.84 billion in 2015 decreased 4% from $2.97 billion in 2014, reflecting an increased investment in programming and digital distribution initiatives. 

Net earnings from continuing operations in 2015 were $1.40 billion, or $2.87 per diluted share, and included several discrete items that totaled $215 million, net of tax, or $.44 per diluted share.

On an adjusted basis, net earnings from continuing operations were $1.62 billion in 2015 compared with $1.66 billion in 2014, principally because of the lower adjusted operating income. Adjusted EPS was $3.31 in 2015, up 12% from $2.96 in 2014. Weighted average shares outstanding were 489 million in 2015, down from 561 million in the prior year, as a result of the Company’s ongoing share repurchase program as well as the split-off of Outdoor Americas Inc. (“Outdoor Americas”) in the third quarter of 2014.

Adjusted results for 2015 excluded restructuring charges, an impairment charge, and gains from the sales of Internet businesses in China. For 2014, adjusted operating income excluded restructuring charges and an impairment charge. For 2014, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted EPS also excluded a loss on early extinguishment of debt. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to reported results are included at the end of this earnings release.

Net earnings per diluted share of $5.27 for 2014 included a gain of $1.56 billion, or $2.78 per diluted share, recognized in connection with the split-off of Outdoor Americas.

These increases principally reflect premiums paid in 2014 in connection with the Company’s debt refinancing.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company repurchased 10.6 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock for $500 million. For the full year, the Company repurchased 51.7 million shares for $2.80 billion, leaving $2.00 billion of authorization remaining under the Company’s share repurchase program at December 31, 2015.

Adjusted Operating Income and Segment Operating Income

The following tables set forth the Company’s Adjusted Operating Income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. The Company defines “Adjusted Operating Income” as operating income excluding restructuring charges, impairment charges, and gain on sales of businesses, where applicable. For each individual reportable segment Adjusted Operating Income is also known as “Segment Operating Income”. The Company presents Segment Operating Income as the primary measure of profit and loss for its reportable segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. 

The Company uses Adjusted Operating Income (or Segment Operating Income for each segment), as well as Adjusted Operating Income Margin, to, among other things, evaluate the Company’s operating performance, to value prospective acquisitions and as one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. These measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of the Company’s operational strength and business performance because they provide a link between profitability and operating cash flow. The Company believes these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management, help improve investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating performance, and make it easier for investors to compare the Company’s results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. In addition, these are among the primary measures used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and for the comparison of the Company’s operating performance to other companies in its industry.

Because Adjusted Operating Income is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income or net earnings as an indicator of operating performance. Adjusted Operating Income, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, this measure does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company’s ability to fund its cash needs. As Adjusted Operating Income excludes certain financial information that is included in operating income and net earnings, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are excluded. The Company provides the following reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Income to operating income and net earnings.

Free Cash Flow

The Company defines free cash flow as its net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations and including capital expenditures. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company’s operations. The Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company’s ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company’s underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by the Company’s investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of the Company’s operating performance to other companies in its industry.

As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use, and is not necessarily a measure of the Company’s ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected in free cash flow.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow.
