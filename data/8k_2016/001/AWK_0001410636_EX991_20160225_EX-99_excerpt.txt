VOORHEES, N.J., Feb. 25, 2016 – American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE: AWK) today reported results for the quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2015. 

“This past year was one of continued strong growth for American Water and outstanding execution by our employees,” said Susan Story, president and CEO of American Water. “Our results were strong, with adjusted earnings per diluted share increasing 8.6 percent, just above the midpoint of our long-term growth outlook of seven to 10 percent. And we invested more capital in our water and wastewater systems than any year in the company’s 130-year history, all to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable service to our customers. 

“Through acquisitions and organic growth, we added and have pending nearly 42,000 customers in our regulated service areas. At the same time, we continued to make improvements in O&M efficiency, allowing us to keep our services affordable. Our Market-based businesses also grew substantially with the Keystone acquisition, the addition of Vandenberg Air Force Base to Military Services and contract growth in our Homeowner Services business,” added Story. 

Consolidated Results 

For the fourth quarter 2015, the company reported income from continuing operations of $99 million, or 55 cents per diluted common share (“diluted share”), compared to 52 cents per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014, a 5.8 percent increase. This increase was mainly driven by higher results in the Regulated business segment, as growth continues to be driven by infrastructure investment. 

For the full year 2015, the company reported income from continuing operations of $476 million, or $2.64 per diluted share, a 10.5 percent increase compared to $2.39 per diluted share for 2014. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 8.6 percent over 2014, after excluding the 2014 costs related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill of four cents per share (a non-GAAP financial measure). These results reflect earnings growth across all American Water businesses, with the contribution from the Regulated businesses increasing 18 cents per share (adjusted for the Freedom Industries chemical spill), the Market-based businesses increasing 2 cents per share and the Parent company improving 1 cent per share mainly from tax benefits. 

In 2015, the company made capital investments of approximately $1.4 billion, including $1.2 billion to replace and improve infrastructure for continued reliable service to customers, $64 million for regulated acquisitions and $133 million to acquire a 95 percent equity interest in Keystone

Clearwater Solutions (“Keystone”). American Water plans to invest about $1.3 billion in 2016, with almost $1.2 billion of this total to improve water and wastewater systems. 

Regulated Businesses 

The Regulated businesses continued to be the largest contributor to earnings and experienced strong growth for the fourth quarter and full year. 

For the fourth quarter 2015, net income from continuing operations was $97 million, compared to $93 million for the same period in 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to continued revenue growth driven by infrastructure investment. Increased revenues were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance (O&M) expense and depreciation compared to the fourth quarter 2014. 

For the full year 2015, net income from continuing operations was $473 million, compared to $434 million in 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to revenue growth driven by the company’s capital investment program and lower O&M expense, offset by increased depreciation. 

For the 12-month period ended Dec. 31, 2015, the adjusted O&M efficiency ratio (a non-GAAP financial measure) improved to 35.9 percent, compared to 36.7 percent for the 12-month period ended Dec. 31, 2014. By reducing O&M expense as a proportion of revenue, American Water is able to make investments in needed capital improvements without significantly impacting customer bills.  

As of Dec. 31, 2015, the company was awarded approximately $67.2 million in additional annualized revenues from general rate cases, infrastructure surcharges and step increases. 

American Water’s Regulated businesses completed 14 acquisitions during 2015, adding nearly 24,000 customers to its existing footprint. Also in 2015, over 9,000 customers were added in existing service areas through organic growth. At the end of 2015, the company had pending acquisition agreements that were signed and awaiting regulatory approval in several jurisdictions that, if approved and completed, will add approximately 9,000 customers to the company’s customer base. 

Market-based Businesses 

For the fourth quarter of 2015, the Market-based Businesses reported net income from continuing operations of $11 million compared to $11 million for the fourth quarter 2014. For the full year 2015, the Market-based Businesses reported net income from continuing operations of $42 million compared to $39 million in 2014.  

For the full year 2015, operating revenues totaled $434 million. Revenues for Military Services increased $41 million due to additional construction project activities and the two new bases added in 2014. Homeowner Services’ revenues increased $15 million from geographic expansion and new contracts in New York City. Keystone also added incremental revenues of $26 million over 2014.  

O&M expense increased $68 million to $358 million from 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to incremental costs associated with construction-type activities in Military Services of $34 million (including the addition of two new contracts), contract growth in Homeowner Services of $13 million, and incremental costs from Keystone of $24 million. 

American Water continued to grow its Market-based Businesses in 2015. In September, Military Services was awarded a contract to manage the water and wastewater systems at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, with estimated revenues of $298 million over the 50-year contract period. Homeowner Services also continued to grow, with a total of approximately 1.6 million contracts and about 65,000 additional customers enrolled in its service warranty programs during 2015. Also, effective July 8, 2015, the company completed its acquisition of a 95 percent equity interest in Keystone Clearwater Solutions.  

Quarterly Dividend 

On Dec. 11, 2015, American Water’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of 34 cents per share of common stock, payable on March 1, 2016, to all shareholders of record as of Feb. 8, 2016. 

2016 Earnings Guidance 

American Water affirmed its 2016 earnings guidance from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85 per diluted share. The company’s earnings forecasts are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below and under “Risk Factors” in its annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This press release includes a presentation of adjusted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations. This item is derived from American Water’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is defined as GAAP diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for the year ended Dec. 31, 2014, excluding the one-time impact of the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia

in 2014. This item constitutes a “non-GAAP financial measure” under SEC rules. This non-GAAP financial measure supplements and should be read in conjunction with the company’s GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to the GAAP measure. 

Management believes this adjustment is useful to investors because it provides the company and its investors with an indication of American Water’s baseline performance excluding items that are not considered to be reflective of ongoing results. Management does not intend results excluding the adjustment to represent results as defined by GAAP or as an indicator of the company’s performance. The company’s definition of adjusted EPS from continuing operations may not be comparable to the same or similar measures used by other companies, and accordingly, this non-GAAP financial measure may have significant limitations on its use. 

This press release also includes a presentation of adjusted O&M efficiency ratio, which excludes from its calculation estimated purchased water revenues and purchased water expenses, and the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes, and the impact of the Freedom Industries chemical spill, as well as the estimated impact of weather. This item is derived from American Water’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The item constitutes a “non-GAAP financial measure” under SEC rules. This non-GAAP financial measure supplements and should be read in conjunction with the company’s GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to the GAAP measure. 

Management believes the presentation of this measure is useful to investors because it provides a means of evaluating the company’s operating performance without giving effect to items that are not reflective of management’s ability to increase efficiency of the company’s regulated operations. In preparing operating plans, budgets and forecasts, and in assessing historical performance, management relies, in part, on trends in the company’s historical results, exclusive of estimated revenues and expenses related to purchased water and the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs. The company’s definition of this metric may not be comparable to the same or similar measures used by other companies, and, accordingly, this non-GAAP financial measure may have significant limitations on its use. 

Set forth at the end of this release are tables that reconcile each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
