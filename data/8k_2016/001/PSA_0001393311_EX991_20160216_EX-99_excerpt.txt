 Public Storage Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2015   

 GLENDALE, California – Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) announced today operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015.   

 Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2015   

 For the three months ended December 31, 2015, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $303.0 million or $1.74 per diluted common share, compared to $284.0 million or $1.64 in 2014 representing an increase of $19.0 million or $0.10. The increase is primarily due to (i) a $39.5 million increase in self-storage net operating income offset partially by (ii) a $30.3 million reduction in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities, primarily due to a $36.5 million gain recognized from our investment in PS Business Parks, Inc. (“PSB”) in the quarter ended December 31, 2014.  

 The $39.5 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $29.5 million increase in our Same Store Facilities and a $9.9 million increase in our Non Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 6.6% or $31.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 1.7% or $1.8 million in the three months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, due primarily to increases in snow removal and on-site property manager payroll. The increase in net operating income for the Non Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of the development and acquisition of 202 self-storage facilities since January 2013.   

 Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2015   

 For the year ended December 31, 2015, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1,053.1 million or $6.07 per diluted common share, compared to $908.2 million or $5.25 in 2014 representing an increase of $144.9 million or $0.82 per diluted common share. The increase is primarily due to (i) a $165.8 million increase in self-storage net operating income and (ii) a $16.0 million increase in gains on sale of real estate, offset partially by (iii) a $22.1 million reduction in equity in earnings of PSB due primarily to reduced gains on disposition in 2015 as compared to 2014 and (iv) a $15.6 million reduction in equity in earnings of Shurgard Europe due primarily to a 16% reduction in the average value of the Euro relative to the dollar.  

 The $165.8 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $114.1 million increase in our Same Store Facilities and a $51.7 million increase in our Non Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 6.5% or $121.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 1.4% or $7.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, due primarily to increases in snow removal and property taxes, offset partially by lower advertising and selling expenses. The increase in net operating income for the Non Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of the development and acquisition of 202 self-storage facilities since January 2013.   

 Funds from Operations  

 For the three months ended December 31, 2015, funds from operations (“FFO”) was $2.46 per diluted common share, as compared to $2.17 in 2014, representing an increase of $0.29 per share. FFO is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and generally represents net income before depreciation, gains and losses and impairment charges with respect to real estate assets.  

 For the year ended December 31, 2015, FFO was $8.79 per diluted common share, as compared to $7.98 in 2014, representing an increase of $0.81 per share.

We also present “Core FFO per share,” a non-GAAP measure that represents FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (ii) EITF D-42 charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, (iii) property acquisition costs and (iv) certain other items. We believe Core FFO per share is a helpful measure used by investors and REIT analysts to understand our performance. However, Core FFO per share is not a substitute for net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology or may not present such a measure, Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.

 Property Operations – Same Store Facilities  

 The Same Store Facilities represent those facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2013 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2014 and 2015.  The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,990 facilities (126.3 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 86% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2015.

   (a)    Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance and retail sales. 

   (b)    See attached reconciliation of self-storage net operating income (“NOI”) to operating income.  

   (c)    Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income.  

   (d)    Contract rent represents the applicable contractual monthly rent charged to our tenants, excluding the impact of promotional discounts, late charges and administrative fees.

 Reconciliation of Self-Storage Net Operating Income to   

 Operating Income 

(Unaudited – amounts in thousands)   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (a)    Net operating income or “NOI” is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense. We believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, in evaluating property performance and in comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results. In addition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate values, and does not consider depreciation expense because it is based upon historical cost. NOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results. This table reconciles from NOI for our self-storage facilities to the operating income presented on our income statement.
