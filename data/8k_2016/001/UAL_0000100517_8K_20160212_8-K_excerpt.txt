ALPA Director Change  

Pursuant to Part II, Section 8.1 of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), the United Airlines Pilots Master Executive Council of the Air Lines Pilots Association, International (“ALPA-MEC”), the holder of the Company’s Class Pilot MEC Junior Preferred Stock, has the right to elect one member to the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) at each annual meeting of stockholders, remove such director with or without cause and to fill any vacancies in such directorship. Captain James Heppner has occupied the ALPA-MEC director position on the Board since 2012.  

On February 12, 2016, ALPA notified the Company that Captain Heppner would leave the Board as of March 1, 2016. Captain Heppner’s departure was not due to any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices. The ALPA-MEC also notified the Company that the ALPA-MEC has designated Captain Todd Insler to fill the vacancy resulting from Captain Heppner’s departure, effective March 1, 2016. At this time, the Board has not yet designated any committees upon which Captain Insler will serve.  

Other than pursuant to the rights of the ALPA-MEC described above, Captain Insler is not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any person pursuant to which he was appointed a director, nor is he a party to any transaction requiring disclosure pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.  

 ITEM 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.  

On February 18, 2016, the Board adopted an amendment and restatement of the Company’s bylaws (the “Amended and Restated Bylaws”) to implement proxy access. Section 2.13 has been added to permit a stockholder or group of up to 20 stockholders owning 3% or more of the Company’s common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders, director candidates constituting up to the greater of two or 20% of the Board elected by the holders of the Company’s common stock, provided that the stockholder (or group) and each nominee satisfy the requirements specified in the Amended and Restated Bylaws. The amendment is effective immediately.  

The foregoing description of the changes effected by the Amended and Restated Bylaws is qualified by reference to the Amended and Restated Bylaws, which are filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this current report on Form 8-K (marked to show such amendments) and are incorporated herein by reference.
