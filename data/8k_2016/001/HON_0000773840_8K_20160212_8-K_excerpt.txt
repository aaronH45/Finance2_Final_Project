Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year 

(a) On February 12, 2016, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Honeywell International Inc. (the “Corporation”) amended Article III, Sections 4 and 5 of the Corporation’s By-laws (“By-laws”) related to the Corporation’s proxy access provisions.  

As previously disclosed, in December 2015, the Corporation amended its By-laws to implement a proxy access by-law. In light of the continued evolution of the practice regarding proxy access implementation and as a result of stockholder feedback, the Board determined that it would be in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders to approve and adopt three amendments to the By-laws: i) to permit third party compensation for Board nominees, so long as the compensation is disclosed, ii) to limit the indemnification by stockholders who nominate Board members to actions prior to the election of a nominee, not post-election and iii) to change the recall period for loaned shares from three business days to five business days. 

This description of the amendments to the By-laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the By-laws filed as Exhibit 3(ii) to this Report. A copy of the By-laws marked to show the changes from the prior By-laws is also included as Exhibit 3(iii) to this Report.
