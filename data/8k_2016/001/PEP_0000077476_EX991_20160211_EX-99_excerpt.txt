Reported (GAAP) Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2015 Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

PURCHASE, N.Y. - February 11, 2016 - PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) today reported organic revenue growth of 4 percent for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 5 percent for the full year, and core earnings per share of $1.06 for the quarter and $4.57 for the year. 

“We are happy to report that we met or exceeded every financial goal we set for 2015, demonstrating consistent performance in the face of volatile macros,” said Chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi. 

1 Please refer to the Glossary for the definitions of Non-GAAP financial measures including core, constant currency, organic and free cash flow.

“Our portfolio has been strategically designed to weather the current macroeconomic challenges. Our results reflect the balance of our brand portfolio, geographic footprint, consistent marketplace execution and a relentless focus on productivity. While facing the challenges of a choppy macro environment, we continued to make thoughtful investments in our future. By making investments in our brands, product innovation and supply chain, we have fortified our business for sustained growth. Notably, we increased advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of sales by 40 basis points for the full year and 85 basis points in the fourth quarter. 

“Our financial performance translated into strong cash generation, enabling us to continue to provide attractive cash returns to our shareholders. In 2015 we returned more than $9 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, bringing our cumulative 10-year shareholder cash returns to more than $65 billion. 

“Looking ahead to 2016, we expect solid financial performance despite expected continued macroeconomic challenges, particularly in certain key developing and emerging markets. Returning cash to shareholders remains a top priority. We are increasing our dividend per share for the 44th consecutive year, beginning with our June 2016 payment, and we expect to return approximately $7 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.”

Summary Fourth Quarter 2015 Performance (Percent Growth)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

a Organic results are non-GAAP financial measures that adjust for impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, including the previously announced Venezuela deconsolidation, and foreign exchange translation, as applicable. For more information about our organic results and the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation, see “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information” in the attached exhibits. Please refer to the Glossary for the definition of “Organic.”

b Core constant currency results are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items affecting comparability and foreign exchange translation. For more information about our core constant currency results, see “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information” in the attached exhibits. Please refer to the Glossary for definitions of “Core” and “Constant Currency.”

c Reported operating profit performance was impacted by certain items excluded from our core results in both 2015 and 2014. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information” in the attached exhibits for more information about these items. 

d Snacks/Beverages.

e 6 percent increase excluding an impairment charge associated with ceasing operations of a dairy joint venture.

f 13 percent decrease excluding Venezuela from the Q4 2014 base and the net impact of efficiency initiatives.

g 1 percent increase excluding Venezuela from the Q4 2014 base. 

h Flat excluding Venezuela from the Q4 2014 base.

Summary of Fourth Quarter Financial Performance:

•Organic revenue grew 4 percent and reported net revenue declined 7 percent. Foreign exchange translation had an 8-percentage-point unfavorable impact on reported net revenue.

•Core gross margin expanded 165 basis points and core operating margin decreased 20 basis points. Operating margin was negatively impacted by an 85 basis point increase in advertising and marketing expense as a percent of sales, partially offset by the implementation of effective revenue management strategies and previously announced productivity initiatives. Reported gross margin and operating margin both expanded 185 basis points.

•Core constant currency operating profit declined 2 percent. The impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela negatively impacted fourth quarter operating profit performance by 2 percentage points. Reported operating profit increased 10 percent and benefited from lower restructuring and impairment charges, pension-related settlements, including the lapping of a pension lump sum settlement charge, the mark-to-market net impact on commodity hedges, and the lapping of a re-measurement of certain net monetary assets of our Venezuelan businesses, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange translation. 

•Company’s core effective tax rate was 22.5 percent, which compares to 25.5 percent in the prior-year quarter. The reported effective tax rate was 11.2 percent, below the prior year quarter of 25.6 percent, as a result of a non-cash tax benefit.

•Core EPS was $1.06 and reported EPS was $1.17. Core EPS excludes a $0.16 per share non-cash tax benefit and a $0.01 per share benefit for a pension-related settlement, partially offset by $0.06 per share of restructuring and impairment charges related to our previously announced productivity initiatives.

Discussion of Full-Year Division Core Constant Currency Operating Profit Results:

Core constant currency operating profit results for all divisions were positively impacted by organic revenue increases as presented in the tables on pages 6 and A-6. In addition, results for each division were impacted by the following: 

Frito-Lay North America (FLNA)

Positively impacted by productivity gains and lower commodity costs, partially offset by operating cost inflation and higher advertising and marketing expense.

Quaker Foods North America (QFNA)

Negatively impacted by impairment charges related to a dairy joint venture, operating cost inflation, higher advertising and marketing expense and the lapping of a gain associated with the divestiture of a cereal business in the prior year. These impacts were partially offset by productivity gains, lower commodity costs and favorable product mix. 

North America Beverages (NAB)

Positively impacted by productivity gains and lower commodity costs, partially offset by operating cost inflation and higher advertising and marketing expense. 

Latin America

Positively impacted by productivity gains, partially offset by operating cost inflation, higher commodity costs, primarily from transaction-related foreign exchange, the fourth-quarter impact of the deconsolidation of Venezuela as well as the net impact of efficiency initiatives. 

Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA)

Positively impacted by productivity gains, the net impact of efficiency initiatives and the net impact of prior-year impairment charges associated with a brand in Greece, partially offset by higher commodity costs, primarily from transaction-related foreign exchange, operating cost inflation, higher advertising and marketing expense and the lapping of a prior-year gain associated with the sale of agricultural assets. 

Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA)

Positively impacted by productivity gains and lower commodity costs. These impacts were partially offset by operating cost inflation, higher advertising and marketing expense and an impairment charge associated with a joint venture. In addition, the net impact of the refranchising of a portion of our beverage businesses in India and in the Middle East had a slight positive impact, which includes a gain from the India refranchising in the current year and lapping of a prior-year gain in the Middle East.

2016 Guidance and Outlook2 

The Company expects 2016 organic revenue growth of approximately 4 percent, excluding the impact of the 53rd week. Based on current foreign exchange market consensus rates, foreign exchange translation is expected to negatively impact reported net revenue growth by 4 percentage points and the 53rd week in 2016 is expected to contribute approximately 1 percentage point to reported net revenue growth. 

The Company expects 2016 core earnings per share of $4.66, driven by the following expectations and factors:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Core earnings per share guidance includes the following detailed expectations:

•Low-single-digit commodity deflation excluding the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange. Including the impact of transaction-related foreign exchange, commodities are expected to have low-single-digit inflation;

•The benefit of a 53rd week will be reinvested in certain productivity and growth initiatives;

•Productivity savings of approximately $1 billion;

•Lower corporate unallocated expense, driven primarily by lower pension expense; 

•Higher net interest expense driven by higher debt balances; and

•A core effective tax rate approximately even with the 2015 full-year core effective tax rate. 

Further, the Company expects: 

•Over $10 billion in cash flow from operating activities and more than $7 billion in free cash flow (excluding certain items); and

•Net capital spending of approximately $3 billion.

2 PepsiCo’s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. PepsiCo’s 2016 fiscal year includes 53 weeks of results.

3 Based on current foreign exchange market consensus rates.

The Company also announced a 7.1 percent increase in its annualized dividend to $3.01 per share from $2.81 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2016. Total dividends to shareholders are expected to be approximately $4 billion in 2016. In addition, the Company anticipates share repurchases of approximately $3 billion, resulting in expected total cash returned to shareholders of approximately $7 billion in 2016. 

Conference Call:

Miscellaneous Disclosures

In discussing financial results and guidance, the company may refer to certain measures not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Reconciliations of any such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP can be found in the attached exhibits, as well as on the company’s website at www.pepsico.com in the “Investors” section under “Events & Presentations.” Our non-GAAP measures exclude from reported results those items that management believes are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflect how management evaluates our operating results and trends.

Glossary

Acquisitions and divestitures: All merger and acquisition activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.

Beverage volume: Volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our bottlers.

Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior year average foreign exchange rates.

Core: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our historical results. In 2015, core results exclude the commodity mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, pension-related settlement benefits, a charge related to the transaction with Tingyi, Venezuela impairment charges and a non-cash tax benefit. In 2014, core results exclude the commodity mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, a pension lump sum settlement charge and a Venezuela remeasurement charge. See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information” for additional information.

A - 16

Division operating profit: The aggregation of the operating profit for each of our reportable segments, which excludes the impact of corporate unallocated expenses.

Effective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.

Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending plus sales of property, plant and equipment. See above for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP (operating cash flow).

Free cash flow, excluding certain items: Free cash flow, excluding: (1) payments related to restructuring charges, (2) pension-related settlements from previous acquisitions, and (3) the tax impacts associated with each of these items, as applicable. This non-GAAP financial measure is our primary measure used to monitor cash flow performance. Also referred to as “core free cash flow.” See above for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP (operating cash flow). See “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information” for additional information.

Mark-to-market gain or loss or net impact: Change in market value for commodity contracts that we purchase to mitigate the volatility in costs of energy and raw materials that we consume. The market value is determined based on average prices on national exchanges and recently reported transactions in the marketplace.

Net capital spending: Capital spending less cash proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment.

Organic: A measure that adjusts for impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, including the Venezuela deconsolidation, and foreign exchange translation. This measure excludes the fourth quarter 2014 results of our Venezuelan businesses, which were deconsolidated effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015. This measure also excludes the impact of the 53rd reporting week in 2016. In excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, we assume constant foreign exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. See the definition of “Constant currency” for additional information.

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information (unaudited)

Division operating profit, core results, core constant currency results and organic results are non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain items noted below. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP. However, we believe investors should consider these measures as they are indicative of our ongoing performance and reflect how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP reporting measures.

Commodity mark-to-market net impact

In the quarter and year ended December 26, 2015, we recognized $1 million and $11 million of mark-to-market net gains, respectively, on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. In the quarter and year ended December 27, 2014, we recognized $100 million and $68 million of mark-to-market net losses, respectively, on commodity hedges in corporate unallocated expenses. We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, metals and energy. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses, as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.

Restructuring and impairment charges

2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan

In the quarter and year ended December 26, 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $75 million and $169 million, respectively, in conjunction with the multi-year productivity plan we publicly announced in 2014 (2014 Productivity Plan). In the quarter and year ended December 27, 2014, we incurred restructuring charges of $130 million and $357 million, respectively, in conjunction with our 2014 Productivity Plan. The 2014 Productivity Plan includes the next generation of productivity initiatives that we believe will strengthen our food, snack and beverage businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency. The 2014 Productivity Plan is in addition to the 2012 Productivity Plan and is expected to continue the benefits of that plan.

A - 17

2012 Multi-Year Productivity Plan

In the quarter and year ended December 26, 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $42 million and $61 million, respectively, in conjunction with the multi-year productivity plan we publicly announced in 2012 (2012 Productivity Plan). In the quarter and year ended December 27, 2014, we incurred restructuring charges of $30 million and $61 million, respectively, in conjunction with our 2012 Productivity Plan. The 2012 Productivity Plan included actions in every aspect of our business that we believe would strengthen our complementary food, snack and beverage businesses by: leveraging new technologies and processes across PepsiCo’s operations, go-to-market and information systems; heightening the focus on best practice sharing across the globe; consolidating manufacturing, warehouse and sales facilities; and implementing simplified organization structures, with wider spans of control and fewer layers of management. The 2012 Productivity Plan has enhanced PepsiCo’s cost-competitiveness and provided a source of funding for future brand-building and innovation initiatives.

Venezuela 

Prior to the end of the third quarter of 2015, the financial position and results of operations of our Venezuelan businesses, which consist of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and our beverage joint venture with our franchise bottler in Venezuela, were reported under highly inflationary accounting, with the functional currency of the U.S. dollar. 

The evolving conditions in Venezuela, including increasingly restrictive exchange control regulations and reduced access to dollars through official currency exchange markets, resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and the U.S. dollar, which, together with other factors, significantly impacted our ability to effectively manage our Venezuelan businesses. As a result, effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015, we concluded that we did not meet the accounting criteria for control over our wholly-owned Venezuelan subsidiaries, and therefore we deconsolidated our wholly-owned Venezuelan subsidiaries effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015. We also concluded that, effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015, we no longer had significant influence over our joint venture, which was previously accounted for under the equity method. As a result of these conclusions, effective at the end of the third quarter of 2015, we began accounting for our investments in our wholly-owned Venezuelan subsidiaries and our joint venture using the cost method of accounting and recorded pre- and after-tax charges of $1.4 billion in our Consolidated Statement of Income to reduce the value of the cost method investments to their estimated fair values, resulting in a full impairment. The impairment charges primarily included approximately $1.2 billion related to our investments in previously consolidated Venezuelan subsidiaries and our joint venture, and $111 million related to the reclassification of cumulative translation losses. The estimated fair value of the investments in our Venezuelan entities was derived using discounted cash flow analyses, including U.S. dollar exchange and discount rate assumptions that reflect the inflation and economic uncertainty in Venezuela, and are considered non-recurring Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. The factors that led to the above-mentioned conclusions at the end of the third quarter of 2015 continued to exist as of the end of 2015. 

As of the end of 2015, consistent with the end of the third quarter of 2015, we did not consolidate the assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiaries in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we no longer included the results of our Venezuelan businesses in our Consolidated Statement of Income and our financial results only included revenue relating to the sales of inventory to our Venezuelan entities to the extent cash was received for those sales. In 2015, the results of our operations in Venezuela, which include the months of January through August, generated 2% of our net revenue and 2% of our operating profit, prior to the impairment charges of $1.4 billion. 

Any dividends from our Venezuelan entities will be recorded as income upon receipt of the cash. We did not receive any U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter of 2015 from our Venezuelan entities. Our ongoing contractual commitments to our Venezuelan businesses are not material.

Venezuela remeasurement charge

In the quarter and year ended December 27, 2014, we recorded a $105 million net charge related to our remeasurement of the bolivar for certain net monetary assets of our Venezuelan businesses. $126 million of this charge was recorded in corporate unallocated expenses, with the balance (equity income of $21 million) recorded in our Latin America segment. 

Free cash flow, excluding certain items

Free cash flow (excluding the items noted in the Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Reconciliation table) is the primary measure management uses to monitor cash flow performance. This is not a measure defined by GAAP. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Additionally, we consider certain other items (included in the Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Reconciliation table) in evaluating free cash flow that we believe investors should consider in evaluating our free cash flow results.

Tax benefit

In the year ended December 26, 2015, we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $230 million associated with our agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all open matters related to the audits for taxable years 2010 through 2011, which reduced our reserve for uncertain tax positions for the tax years 2010 through 2011.

2016 guidance

Our 2016 core tax rate guidance and our 2016 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the commodity mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses and restructuring and impairment charges. Our 2016 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, including the Venezuela deconsolidation, and foreign exchange translation. Our 2016 organic revenue growth guidance also excludes the impact of a 53rd reporting week in 2016. In addition, our 2016 organic revenue growth guidance and our 2016 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the impact of foreign exchange. We are not able to reconcile our full year projected 2016 core tax rate to our full year projected 2016 reported tax rate and our full year projected 2016 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2016 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2016 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity hedges due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. We are also unable to reconcile our full year projected 2016 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2016 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2016 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.
