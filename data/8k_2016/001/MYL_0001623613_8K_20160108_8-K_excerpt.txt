 Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

On January 8, 2016, John D. Sheehan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Mylan, notified Mylan that he will retire effective as of April 1, 2016. Mylan issued a press release regarding Mr. Sheehan’s retirement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.  

On January 8, 2016, Mylan Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Mylan N.V., entered into an Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement with Anthony Mauro, who has been promoted from President, North America to Chief Commercial Officer effective as of January 4, 2016. The Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement is effective as of January 1, 2016 and automatically renews on each anniversary of the effective date unless earlier terminated by Mr. Mauro or Mylan Inc. The Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement contains substantially the same terms as his existing contract, except that Mr. Mauro’s base salary has been increased to $700,000 in connection with his promotion to Chief Commercial Officer.  

The Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement also contains terms relating to benefits upon termination of employment, which are consistent with Mr. Mauro’s existing agreement. In the event that Mr. Mauro’s employment is terminated without cause, he would be entitled to a severance payment equal to his base salary, a pro-rata bonus based on actual performance and one year of continued health benefits. In the event of termination of employment by reason of death or disability, Mr. Mauro or his estate would receive payments and benefits as if his employment had been terminated without cause, as described above, provided that such payments and benefits will be reduced by any death or disability benefits payable to him under other plans or arrangements. Upon non-renewal, Mr. Mauro’s employment will terminate as of the first anniversary of the effective date or the end of any renewal term (as applicable), and he will be entitled to a severance payment equal to his base salary and one year of continued health benefits.
