Item 3.03 Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders 

On January 26, 2016, stockholders of Hormel Foods Corporation (the Company) approved a proposal to effect a two-for-one split of the Company’s common stock. Per the proposal, the Company’s common stock will be reclassified by reducing the par value from $.0293 per share to $.01465 per share and increasing the number of authorized shares from 800 million to 1.6 billion shares, in order to effect a two-for-one stock split. 

The Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation was amended effective January 27, 2016, to effect the split, as described above. Per that amendment, each stockholder of record on January 26, 2016 will be entitled to receive one additional share of common stock, at a par value of $.01465, for each share of common stock already held on that date. The Company will distribute the additional shares of $.01465 par value common stock in uncertificated (book-entry) form on or about February 9, 2016. The Company will also reserve for issuance the maximum number of shares of common stock subject to options and other awards which have been granted or may be granted under the Company’s stock award and other stock plans, which provide that the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance shall be appropriately adjusted in the event of a stock split.
