RESTON, VA - Feb. 11, 2016 - VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ: VRSN), a global leader in domain names and Internet security, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015.

Fourth Quarter GAAP Financial Results

VeriSign, Inc. and subsidiaries (“Verisign”) reported revenue of $273 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, up 6.5 percent from the same quarter in 2014.

The operating margin was 58.1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 55.6 percent for the same quarter in 2014. 

As described in fourth quarter of 2014 earnings news release, net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was decreased by $26 million and diluted EPS was decreased by $0.19 primarily due to a non-U.S. income tax charge related to a reorganization of certain international operations and a change in estimate for U.S. income tax charges related to the repatriation of offshore assets. 

Fourth Quarter Non-GAAP Financial Results

Verisign reported, on a non-GAAP basis, net income of $105 million and diluted EPS of $0.79 for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to net income of $95 million and diluted EPS of $0.70 for the same quarter in 2014.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA

Verisign provides quarterly and annual financial statements that are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Along with this information, management typically discloses and discusses certain non-GAAP financial information in quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls and during investor conferences and related events. This non-GAAP financial information does not include the following types of financial measures that are included in GAAP: stock-based compensation, unrealized gain/loss on the contingent interest derivative on the subordinated convertible debentures, and non-cash interest expense. Non-GAAP net income is decreased by amounts accrued, if any, during the period for contingent interest payable resulting from upside or downside triggers related to the subordinated convertible debentures and is adjusted for an income tax rate of 26 percent for 2015 and 28 percent for 2014, both of which differ from the GAAP income tax rate.

On a quarterly basis, Verisign also provides Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated in accordance with the terms of the indentures governing Verisign’s 4.625% senior notes due 2023 and 5.25% senior notes due 2025. Adjusted EBITDA refers to net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, unrealized loss (gain) on the contingent interest derivative on the subordinated convertible debentures and unrealized loss (gain) on hedging agreements.

Management believes that this non-GAAP financial data supplements the GAAP financial data by providing investors with additional information that allows them to have a clearer picture of Verisign’s operations. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the non-GAAP information enhances investors’ overall understanding of Verisign’s financial performance and the comparability of Verisign’s operating results from period to period.

The tables appended to this news release include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial information to the comparable financial information reported in accordance with GAAP for the given periods.
