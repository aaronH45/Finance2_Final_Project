U.S. BANCORP 

Forward-looking Statements 

and Additional Information 

The following information appears in accordance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:  

This presentation contains forward-looking statements about U.S. Bancorp. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including  

statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and are based on the information available to, and assumptions and  

estimates made by, management as of the date made. These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue  

and expenses and the future plans and prospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and  

important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. A reversal or slowing of the current economic recovery or  

another severe contraction could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp’s revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities. Global financial markets  

could experience a recurrence of significant turbulence, which could reduce the availability of funding to certain financial institutions and lead to a  

tightening of credit, a reduction of business activity, and increased market volatility. Stress in the commercial real estate markets, as well as a  

downturn in the residential real estate markets, could cause credit losses and deterioration in asset values. In addition, U.S. Bancorp’s business  

and financial performance is likely to be negatively impacted by recently enacted and future legislation and regulation. U.S. Bancorp’s results  

could also be adversely affected by deterioration in general business and economic conditions; changes in interest rates; deterioration in the credit 

quality of its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of securities held in its investment  

securities portfolio; legal and regulatory developments; litigation; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; changes in customer  

behavior and preferences; breaches in data security; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting  

policies and judgments; and management’s ability to effectively manage credit risk, market risk, operational risk, compliance risk, strategic risk,  

interest rate risk, liquidity risk and reputational risk.  

For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to U.S. Bancorp’s Annual Report on  

Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the sections entitled “Risk  

Factors” and “Corporate Risk Profile” contained in Exhibit 13, and all subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under  

Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made,  

and U.S. Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.  

This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures to describe U.S. Bancorp’s performance. The calculations of these measures are  

provided within or in the appendix of the presentation. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in  

accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
