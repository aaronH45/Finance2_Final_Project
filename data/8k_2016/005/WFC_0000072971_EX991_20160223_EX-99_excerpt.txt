OUR CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT 2  

A message 

from John Stumpf      

At Wells Fargo, holding ourselves to the highest standards of ethical behavior is nothing new: it’s one of the five shared values that define who we are (as described in The Vision & Values of Wells Fargo), and it’s been the cornerstone of our culture since 1852! In a nutshell, according to our Vision & Values, “Our ethics are the sum of all the decisions each of us makes every day.” 

To help guide you in these decisions, I am pleased to introduce our revised Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. The Code works in conjunction with our Vision & Values, our Team Member Handbook, and our company policies to help you navigate situations and answer questions about what to do in specific circumstances. 

Keep in mind that the Code is not intended to be a comprehensive rulebook. Should you find yourself in doubt, it is important for you to ask questions of your manager or through one of the resources listed in the Code, including the confidential EthicsLine. 

We are all responsible for maintaining the highest possible ethical standards in how we conduct our business and serve customers. After all, our culture is centered on relationships, and those relationships are built on trust. Our customers have high expectations of us, and we have even higher expectations of ourselves. 

Thanks for all you do to create and maintain that culture and to serve our customers, communities, team members, and shareholders. 

Sincerely, 

/s/ John G. Stumpf 

John G. Stumpf 

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer     

3 OUR CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT  

Our Vision & Values guide our actions  

Regardless of our growing size, scope, and reach, our common Vision & Values form the fabric that holds us together wherever we are, whatever we do.  

Our Vision & Values have helped create a unique culture at Wells Fargo that sets us apart and defines who we are as an organization. We are proud of our culture and its focus on:  

Serving our customers  

Connecting with our communities and stakeholders  

Caring about one another and those we serve  

In order to maintain our reputation as a trusted, ethical company, we must do our part to ensure that our values come alive through our actions. Every day when we come to work, we have the opportunity to bring our Vision & Values to life.  

Our culture is continually renewed by the choices and actions each of us makes every day. This Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (“Code”) contains basic principles and additional guidance to help us make the best decisions and to comply with the laws, rules and regulations that govern our business. This Code, together with our Vision & Values, Team Member Handbook, other detailed regional and business work rules, and our more comprehensive company policies, are intended to serve as resources when we are faced with ethics or compliance issues or when we have questions about what to do in specific situations. 

How to use our Code  

No code of conduct can cover every possible situation, which is why we rely on you to use good judgment and to speak up promptly when you have questions or concerns.  

In addition to the Code, we also have a number of other resources and corporate and line of business policies for team members. Throughout the Code, we have listed policies that provide more detail on specific topics. Also included is advice on where to go for additional guidance and support.  

Wells Fargo operates globally, and if, at any time, this Code or our policies differ with local laws, rules, and regulations, you should comply with the more restrictive policies, laws, rules, or regulations. Whenever the applicability or interpretation is unclear, team members should contact their manager, HR Advisor (for U.S.-based team members), appropriate Human Resources professional (for non U.S.-based team members), or the Office of Global Ethics and Integrity. Directors of Wells Fargo & Company should contact the General Counsel, Corporate Secretary or Chair of the Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Wells Fargo & Company. 

OUR CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT 4  

People as a competitive advantage  

We’re a relationship company, but our relationships with our customers are only as strong as our relationships with each other.  

As team members and representatives of Wells Fargo, we always value and support one another. We believe everyone on our team is important and deserves respect.  

   •   We treat one another with fairness and dignity; we do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or intimidation.  

   •   When working with others, we let them know that they are expected to act in a manner consistent with our sense of fair treatment and equal opportunity.  

   •   We respect, honor and appreciate one another. 

Who needs to follow our Code?  

Our Code applies to all team members, including officers, as well as directors of Wells Fargo & Company and its subsidiaries, regardless of location or whether the team member is classified as regular, part-time, or flexible.  

In addition, we look for third-party service providers that share our commitment to integrity, customer service, ethics, compliance, and behavior that is consistent with our Code. We will take the appropriate actions where we believe they have not met our high standards, their contractual obligations, or have violated any applicable law, rule, or regulation. See the Supplier Code of Conduct for additional guidance. 

5 OUR CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT  

Ethics  

Our ethics are the sum of all the decisions each of us makes every day.  

We have a responsibility to always act with honesty and integrity. When we do so, we earn the trust of our customers. We have to earn that trust every day by behaving ethically, rewarding open, honest communication, and holding ourselves accountable for our decisions and actions. 

What’s right for customers  

We want to be approachable and caring, exceed our customers’ expectations, and invest in relationships that last a lifetime.  

Our customers are always our priority. Our customer focus is one of the characteristics that distinguishes us from our competitors. We do what’s right for our customers by:  

   •   Helping them make informed financial choices and being honest and fair in our dealings and communications with them.  

   •   Protecting customer confidential information and data.  

   •   Providing timely and fair resolution to customer concerns and complaints. 

Making the right choice  

If you’re faced with an ethical dilemma and you’re not sure what to do, ask these questions:  

 If your answer to any of these questions is “No,” don’t do it.   You may use the resources on pages 8 and 21 for further guidance and help answering these questions.  

Closing the loop  

Our approach to ethics and business conduct must continually evolve to stay current with new and emerging risk areas. Once you’ve made a decision, ask yourself the following additional question: 

Do you believe there are sufficient standards, policies and team member resources in place to address the issue you faced – or should more be done?  

If you believe more should be done, contact the Office of Global Ethics and Integrity. Your suggestions will help us improve our ethics and compliance programs. 

OUR CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT 6  

Diversity and inclusion  

We value and promote diversity in every aspect of our business and at every level of our organization.  

Collaboration and inclusiveness are central to how we work because the best solutions are often those that draw on our diverse ideas and perspectives.  

As team members we have a responsibility to:  

   •   Do our part to help Wells Fargo to serve and earn business from a wide variety of communities and stakeholders.  

   •   Integrate diversity into our sourcing processes.  

   •   Help create an environment where all team members can contribute, develop, and fully use their talents.  

   •   Keep an open mind to new ideas, and listen to different points of view.  

Leadership  

We want all team members to be able to lead themselves, lead the team, and lead the business.  

Every team member is expected to be a leader. This means that each of us must take responsibility for maintaining Wells Fargo’s reputation and for ensuring that we always act with honesty and integrity. Each of us must:  

   •   Act consistently with our Vision & Values.  

   •   Be familiar and comply with this Code; applicable laws, rules, and regulations; and company and line of business policies. Pay particular attention to the policies that pertain to your job responsibilities.  

   •   Be a role model for ethical leadership, and support your fellow team members when they ask questions and raise ethical concerns.  

   •   Help maintain a culture where everyone feels comfortable speaking up.  

   •   Never pressure a team member or third-party service provider to do something for you that is outside the scope of standard business practice.  

   •   Complete required training in a timely manner.  

   •   Cooperate and be honest and accurate when responding to any formal investigation, regulatory examination, audit or similar type of inquiry.  

Accountability  

We are all accountable for complying with the Code, as well as all company policies and applicable laws, rules, and regulations that apply to us. Likewise, we are all accountable for our decisions and actions, especially managing the risks inherent in our roles and appropriately escalating issues and violations of which we become aware. If mistakes are made, we acknowledge them and act to correct them.  

Violation of the provisions of this Code or the referenced policies and guidelines is grounds for corrective action, which may include termination of your employment. Certain actions may also result in legal proceedings, including prosecution for criminal liability.  

We do not tolerate retaliation  

We do not engage in or tolerate retaliation of any kind against anyone for providing information in good faith about suspected unethical or illegal activities, including possible violations of this Code, violations of laws, rules, or regulations by others, or concerns regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters. If you think that you or someone you know has been retaliated against, contact any of the resources listed in this Code.

Where to go for help  

We have a responsibility to protect the reputation and integrity of Wells Fargo. If you see or suspect illegal or unethical behavior involving Wells Fargo, including possible violations of this Code, or violations of laws, rules or regulations—whether it relates to you, your manager, a co-worker, a customer or a third-party service provider—or if you have a question or need help making an ethics or compliance decision, you have several options. You can contact any of the following at any time:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   •   Discuss the matter with any manager in your organization’s reporting line to whom you feel comfortable talking.  

   •   Contact HR Advisor, (for U.S.-based team members) or the appropriate Human Resources professional (for non U.S.-based team members).  

   •   Contact the Office of Global Ethics and Integrity.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We are committed to investigating potential violations and dealing with each report fairly and reasonably. 

Our EthicsLine and how it works  

Our EthicsLine is a confidential way to report possible violations of the Code or any laws, rules, or regulations. You may contact the EthicsLine 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  

   •   1-800-382-7250 or  

   •   Wells Fargo EthicsLine Web Reporting  

   •   Team members outside of the United States can call using international phone numbers and access codes.  

The EthicsLine call center is staffed by third-party interview specialists. Translation services are available. Where allowed by local law, you may choose to remain anonymous.  

When you contact the EthicsLine, the interview specialist will listen, ask clarifying questions if necessary, and then write a summary report of the call. The summary will then be provided to Wells Fargo for assessment and further action. The Audit & Examination Committee of the Board oversees the investigation of concerns raised about accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters.  

When you contact the EthicsLine, it is important to provide as many details as possible (e.g., who, what, when, where). Because Wells Fargo may need some additional information, you will be assigned a report number and asked to call back at a later date to answer any follow-up questions.  

Any information provided to the EthicsLine will be treated as confidential to the extent allowed by local law. In some instances, during the course of investigations, information may be shared on a need to know basis. Under some circumstances, Wells Fargo may be required to report certain types of suspicious activity and other activity that may potentially violate criminal laws.

We act with honesty and integrity  

Avoid conflicts of interest  

Our standard  

We must avoid conflicts of interest in our personal and business activities, in any number of circumstances, including through outside employment or business activities and personal transactions, finances or relationships. Remember that the appearance of a conflict of interest may be just as damaging to Wells Fargo’s reputation as an actual conflict of interest. The following are examples of actual or potential conflicts of interest:  

   •   A situation that interferes with your duties or responsibilities to Wells Fargo, or that affects your ability to act in the best interests of Wells Fargo  

   •   A situation when you receive an improper benefit as a result of your position with Wells Fargo  

   •   An instance where you learn about a business opportunity through the use of company property, information, or position and use it for personal benefit or otherwise compete with or divert business from Wells Fargo  

   •   Wells Fargo’s interests conflict with a customer’s interest  

   •   The interests of one customer conflict with those of another customer  

Where conflicts cannot be avoided, we should be transparent about their existence and take proactive steps to manage them. 

Always remember  

If you are presented with a situation that might involve a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest, ask these questions:  

   •   Would public disclosure of the matter embarrass Wells Fargo?  

   •   To an impartial observer, would it look like a conflict?  

   •   Is there a specific policy or procedure that covers this type of situation?  

   •   Do I need to get preclearance or disclose the situation in writing?  

When in doubt, discuss the matter with your manager or the Office of Global Ethics and Integrity. Additional rules and procedures are applicable to our directors and executive officers.

Team member responsibilities  

   •   When giving a gift or providing entertainment, keep in mind that your actions should never violate applicable laws, and they should be consistent with the customs and policies of Wells Fargo and the recipient.

A final thought  

Our Code covers many of the ethics and business conduct topics that we are likely to face in our work, but no code can cover every possible situation. That is why it is important to remember that you have other resources in addition to our Code that you can use to help you make good decisions:  

   •   The most important resource is you. Rely on your experience and good judgment. But remember, in order to make informed decisions you must know and understand the policies, laws and regulations — especially those that apply to your job.  

   •   Always keep our Vision & Values in mind. They can help you stay on track, make the right decisions, and be clear about our priorities.  

   •   In any situation if you’re not sure what to do, don’t be afraid to ask questions and get help.  

   •   Report concerns regarding possible violations of the Code, laws, rules, regulations or company policies and practices to the EthicsLine.
