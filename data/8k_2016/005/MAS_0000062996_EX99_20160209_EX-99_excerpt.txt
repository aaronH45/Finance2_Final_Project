“Our fourth quarter results illustrate our ability to deliver consistent and profitable growth,” said Masco President and CEO, Keith Allman. “Exceptional improvement in our U.S. cabinet business drove increased revenue and profit. Our industry-leading plumbing businesses continued their excellent performance trend and delivered another quarter of outstanding results.
