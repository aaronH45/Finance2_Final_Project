FOURTH QUARTER 2015 RESULTS 

REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION

Wallingford, Connecticut. January 20, 2016. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) reported today fourth quarter 2015 diluted earnings per share of $0.63 compared to fourth quarter 2014 results of $0.61 on an as reported basis and $0.63, excluding one-time items. Such per share amount for the 2014 quarter included a charge for acquisition-related costs of $10 million ($0.02 per share) including $8 million of amortization of the value associated with acquired backlog relating to an acquisition completed by the Company in the third quarter of 2014 and $2 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $1.431 billion compared to $1.427 billion for the 2014 period. Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the 2014 period. 

For the full year ended December 31, 2015, diluted earnings per share was $2.41 on an as reported basis and $2.43 excluding one-time items, compared to $2.21 on an as reported basis and $2.25 excluding one-time items for the comparable 2014 period. 

The 2015 period includes a charge for acquisition-related transaction costs of $6 million ($0.02 per share). The 2014 period included charges for acquisition-related costs of $14 million ($0.04 per share) of which $10 million was associated with acquisition-related costs as described above and $4 million was for other acquisition-related transaction costs. Sales for the full year ended December 31, 2015 were $5.569 billion compared to $5.346 billion for the 2014 period. Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $190 million for the full year 2015 compared to the 2014 period. 

Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated, “We are very pleased to report results above the high end of our guidance, despite a very challenging economic environment, with fourth quarter 2015 sales and EPS of $1.431 billion and $0.63, respectively. Compared to 2014, sales were flat in US dollars and increased by 3% in local currencies, with strength in the automotive and industrial markets offsetting declines in the information technology and data communications market as well as the mobile networks market. Our growth in local currencies was driven both organically and through the Company’s successful acquisition program. The Company’s unique entrepreneurial culture continues to drive strong operating performance, resulting in very strong operating margins of 20.2% in the fourth quarter 2015. This excellent performance is a direct result of our dynamic management team’s ability to drive excellent profitability through disciplined operational execution and an unrelenting focus on all elements of cost. Operating cash flow in the quarter was a record $322 million, an outstanding performance and a clear confirmation of the quality of the Company’s earnings. I am very proud of our organization as we executed very well in the quarter, despite the current uncertain market environment.” 

“We close 2015 having grown sales and diluted earnings per share, excluding one-time items, by 4% and 8% respectively. In local currencies our sales grew a strong 8%, an excellent reflection of our ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to developing enabling technologies for customers in all markets. This growth was driven by both our organic initiatives as well as our active acquisition program, which continues to expand the Company’s growth opportunities. Consistent with this strategy, and as previously announced, on January 8, 2016 the Company completed the acquisition of FCI Asia Pte Ltd (FCI), the largest acquisition in the Company’s history. The acquisition of FCI, a global leader in interconnect solutions for the information technology & data communications, mobile networks and industrial markets, expands Amphenol’s high technology product portfolio while enabling the Company to bring increased value to customers. We are excited by the great potential that this acquisition creates for Amphenol. In addition to our successful acquisition program, the Company continues to deploy its financial strength in a variety of ways to increase shareholder value. This includes the purchase, during the quarter, of 1.0 million shares of the Company’s stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plan, bringing total repurchases in 2015 to over 4.5 million shares.” 

“Throughout the course of 2015, the global economy has become increasingly uncertain, with significant devaluations in both currency and commodity markets as well as turbulence in emerging markets resulting in more muted overall growth expectations. Considering this economic environment, and based on current currency exchange rates, we expect first quarter 2016 sales in the range of $1.380 billion to $1.420 billion, an increase over 2015 of 4% to 7% in US dollars. 

We expect first quarter 2016 diluted EPS (excluding one-time items) in the range of $0.55 to $0.57, a decline of 4% to flat with 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect to achieve sales in the range of $6.040 billion to $6.200 billion, an increase over 2015 in US dollars of 8% to 11% and -1% to 2% organically. We expect diluted EPS of $2.54 to $2.62 (excluding one-time items) for the full year 2016, an increase of 5% to 8% over 2015. This guidance includes accretion of approximately $0.12 from the acquisition of FCI.” 

“While 2016 has started amidst an environment of increased global economic uncertainty, we remain extremely excited about the future. The electronics revolution continues to create a significant, long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol, with new applications and higher performance requirements driving increased demand for our high technology products across all of our end markets. Our ongoing actions to strengthen our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength, as well as our initiatives to broaden and diversify our high technology product offering both organically and through our successful acquisition program, have created a solid base for future performance. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to dynamically adjust to the constantly changing market environment, to continue to generate strong profitability and to further capitalize on the many opportunities to expand our market position.”
