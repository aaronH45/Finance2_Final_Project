Item 8.01 Other Events.

Gary Norcross, president and chief executive officer of FIS, has adopted a stock trading plan to sell a portion of his common shares of the company in an orderly manner. The transactions may take place from time-to-time in 2016, subject to certain 10b5-1 plan criteria, including certain minimum price levels and daily volume activity. Under the plan, up to 450,000 stock options held by Mr. Norcross that are scheduled to expire in 2016 may be exercised and the underlying shares of FIS stock immediately sold. 

The trading plan is designed to facilitate the orderly exercise of employee stock options as part of personal financial planning, with the goal of minimizing market impact and avoiding any concerns about the timing of the transactions. The plan is in accordance with the guidelines specified by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Rule 10b5-1 permits corporate officers, directors and others to adopt written, pre-arranged stock trading plans when they are not in possession of material, non-public information. Using these plans, insiders may gradually diversify their investment portfolios and spread stock trades over a period of time regardless of any material, non-public information they may receive after adopting their plans. In accordance with 10b5-1 rules, Mr. Norcross will have no discretion over sales under the plan. 

All transactions under the plans will be disclosed through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as required by applicable securities laws. Mr. Norcross is and will continue to be in compliance with FIS' formal stock ownership guidelines for executive officers.
