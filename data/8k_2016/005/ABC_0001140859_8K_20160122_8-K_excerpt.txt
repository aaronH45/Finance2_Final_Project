ITEM 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. 

By-law Amendment 

On January 22, 2016, the Board of Directors of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the “Company”) amended and restated the Company’s bylaws to remove language in Section 3.13 providing that directors may be removed by the Company’s stockholders only for cause. Pursuant to the amended and restated bylaws the Company’s directors may be removed with or without cause. 

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the amended and restated bylaws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Proposal to Amend the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation 

On January 22, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors recommended for stockholder approval an amendment that removes language in Section 5.05 of the Company’s certificate of incorporation providing that directors may be removed by the Company’s stockholders only for cause, so that members of the Board of Directors may be removed with or without cause. On January 22, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors also directed that the recommended amendment to the certificate of incorporation be proposed for stockholder approval no later than the Company’s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, the date of which has not yet been determined. 

Consistent therewith, and in light of a recent ruling by the Delaware Chancery Court not involving the Company, the Company will not enforce the “only for cause” director removal provision.
