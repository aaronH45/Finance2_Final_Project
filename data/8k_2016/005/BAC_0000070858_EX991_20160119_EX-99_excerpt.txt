Notes:

1 Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For reconciliation, see pages 17-19 of this press release.

2 Regulatory capital ratios are preliminary. Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital, Tier 1 capital, risk-weighted assets (RWA), CET1 ratio and bank holding company supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) as shown on a fully phased-in basis are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of CET1 to fully phased-in, see page 13 of this press release.

3 As previously disclosed, Bank of America received approval to begin using the Advanced approaches capital framework to determine risk-based capital and is now required to report regulatory capital under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy and was the Advanced approaches in the fourth quarter of 2015. Prior to exiting the parallel run, we were required to report regulatory capital under the Standardized approach only.

4 With the approval to exit parallel run, U.S. banking regulators requested modifications to certain internal analytical models including the wholesale (e.g., commercial) credit models, which increased our risk-weighted assets in the fourth quarter of 2015. Proforma information for Q3-15 includes the impact of these modifications as if effective at September 30, 2015.

5 Basel 3 fully phased-in Advanced approaches estimates assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models, including approval of the internal models methodology (IMM). As of December 31, 2015, BAC had not received IMM approval.

AFully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis for the Corporation is a non-GAAP financial measure. For reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, refer to pages 17-19 of this press release. Net interest income on a GAAP basis was $9.8 billion, $9.5 billion and $9.6 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Net interest income on an FTE basis, excluding market-related and other adjustments, represents a non-GAAP financial measure. Market-related adjustments of premium amortization expense and hedge ineffectiveness were $0.1 billion, ($0.6) billion and ($0.6) billion for the three months ended December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Other adjustments for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 include $0.6 billion in negative adjustments on certain trust preferred securities. Total revenue, net of interest expense, on a GAAP basis was $19.5 billion, $20.4 billion and $18.7 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Net DVA gains (losses) were ($198) million, $12 million and ($626) million for the three months ended December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.

BNoninterest expense, excluding litigation expense, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Noninterest expense on a GAAP basis was $13.9 billion, $13.8 billion and $14.2 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Litigation expense was $428 million, $231 million and $393 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.

CFully phased-in estimates are non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, refer to pages 17-19 of this press release. On January 1, 2014, the Basel 3 rules became effective, subject to transition provisions primarily related to regulatory deductions and adjustments impacting Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and Tier 1 capital. Bank of America received approval to begin using the Advanced approaches capital framework to determine risk-based capital requirements beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. As previously disclosed, with the approval to exit parallel run, U.S. banking regulators requested modifications to certain internal analytical models including the wholesale (e.g., commercial) credit models, which increased our risk-weighted assets in the fourth quarter of 2015. Proforma information for Q3-15 includes the impact of these modifications as if effective at September 30, 2015. Basel 3 Advanced approaches estimates on a fully phased-in basis assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models, including approval of the internal models methodology (IMM). As of December 31, 2015, BAC had not received IMM approval.

DGlobal Excess Liquidity Sources include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, limited to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS, and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities, and are readily available to meet funding requirements as they arise. It does not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity from the bank or other regulated entities are subject to certain regulatory restrictions. Time to required funding is a debt coverage measure and is expressed as the number of months unsecured holding company obligations of Bank of America Corporation can be met using only the parent company’s Global Excess Liquidity Sources without issuing debt or sourcing additional liquidity. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation. For all periods shown, we have included in the amount of unsecured contractual obligations the liability, including estimated costs, for the previously announced BNY Mellon private-label securitization settlement. As of December 31, 2015, this amount was $8.5B.

EReturn on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information, refer to pages 17-19 of this press release.

H

In January 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The Corporation has early adopted, retrospective to January 1, 2015, the provision that requires the Corporation to present unrealized gains/losses resulting from changes in the Corporation's own credit spreads on liabilities accounted for under the fair value option (referred to as debit valuation adjustments, or DVA) in accumulated OCI. The impact of the adoption was to reclassify, as of January 1, 2015, unrealized DVA losses of $2.0B pretax ($1.2B after tax) from January 1, 2015 retained earnings to accumulated OCI. Further, pretax unrealized DVA gains of $301 million, $301 million and $420 million were reclassified from other income to accumulated OCI for Q3-15, Q2-15 and Q1-15, respectively. This had the effect of reducing net income as previously reported for the aforementioned quarters by $187 million, $186 million and $260 million, or approximately $0.02 per quarter. This change is reflected in consolidated results and the Global Markets segment results. Results for 2014 were not subject to restatement under the provisions of the new accounting guidance. 

Revenue for all periods included net DVA on derivatives, as well as amortization of own credit portion of purchase discount and realized DVA on structured liabilities; periods prior to 2015 also included unrealized DVA on structured liabilities.

Global Markets revenue, excluding net DVA, and sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, are non-GAAP financial measures. Net DVA losses were $198 million and $626 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. FICC net DVA losses were $190 million and $577 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Equities net DVA losses were $8 million and $49 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

ILegacy Assets and Servicing (LAS) noninterest expense, excluding litigation, is a non-GAAP financial measure. LAS noninterest expense was $1.1 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. LAS litigation expense was $353 million, $228 million and $256 million in the three months ended December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.

JReturn on average allocated capital is a non-GAAP financial measure. The company believes the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the segments. Other companies may define or calculate this measure differently. For reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, refer to pages 17-19 of this press release.

KThe estimated supplementary leverage ratio is measured using quarter-end Tier 1 capital as the numerator, calculated under Basel 3 on a fully phased-in basis. The denominator is supplementary leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted Tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. Off-balance sheet exposures primarily include undrawn lending commitments, letters of credit, potential future derivative exposures and repo-style transactions. At December 31, 2015, the estimated SLR for the Bank Holding Company on a fully phased-in basis was 6.4 percent. Differences between fully phased-in and transitional supplementary leverage exposures are immaterial.

Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures

(Dollars in millions)

The Corporation evaluates its business based on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP financial measure. The Corporation believes managing the business with net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and noninterest income. The Corporation views related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratios and net interest yield) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. To derive the fully taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, the Corporation uses the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the basis points the Corporation earns over the cost of funds.

The Corporation also evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders' equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders' equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.

In addition, the Corporation periodically reviews capital allocated to its businesses and allocates capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. The Corporation's internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. Return on average allocated capital is calculated as net income, adjusted for cost of funds and earnings credits and certain expenses related to intangibles, divided by average allocated capital. Allocated capital and the related return both represent non-GAAP financial measures. Allocated capital is reviewed periodically and refinements are made based on multiple considerations that include, but are not limited to, risk-weighted assets measured under Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches, business segment exposures and risk profile, and strategic plans. As part of this process, in 2015, the Corporation adjusted the amount of capital being allocated to its business segments, primarily Legacy Assets & Servicing. 

See the tables below and on pages 18-19 for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to financial measures defined by GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the three months ended December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation. Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently.
