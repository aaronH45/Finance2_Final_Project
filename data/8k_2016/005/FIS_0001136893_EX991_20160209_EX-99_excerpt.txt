JACKSONVILLE, Fla., February 9, 2016 - FIS™ (NYSE:FIS), a global leader in financial services technology, today reported a full year 2015 revenue increase of three percent to $6.6 billion. The increase was seven percent on an adjusted constant currency basis. GAAP net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders was $638.8 million, or $2.21 per diluted share, compared to $690.5 million, or $2.39 per diluted share in 2014. 

2015 full year adjusted EBITDA increased five percent to $2.0 billion. The increase was eight percent on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders increased four percent to $930.4 million. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share increased four percent to $3.22 from $3.10 in 2014. Full year non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations adjusts for acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments of $0.10 per share, acquisition, integration, and severance costs of $0.45 per share, a $0.19 per share benefit from gains on divestitures, global restructuring of $0.10 per share, and purchase accounting amortization expense of $0.54 per share.

“The resilience of our business model characterized by highly recurring revenues and operational efficiencies allowed us to deliver strong cash flows and earnings,” said Gary Norcross, president and chief executive officer, FIS. “The end-of-year closing of the SunGard acquisition allows us to leverage our newly expanded IP-led solutions portfolio to create deeper and broader relationships with our more than 20,000 clients. The acquisition creates a solid foundation for meeting our 2016 goals and driving long-term value creation for our shareholders.”

Fourth Quarter 2015

The quarter ending December 31, 2015, benefitted from the acquisition, increasing reported revenue eleven percent to $1.9 billion from $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, or eighteen percent on an adjusted constant currency basis. GAAP net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders was $105.5 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to $202.4 million, or $0.71 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.

Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders increased to $278.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 from $249.3 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share increased seven percent to $0.93 per share from $0.87 per share in the fourth quarter 2014. Fourth quarter non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations adjusts for acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments of $0.10 per share, acquisition, integration, and severance costs of $0.26 per share, a $0.03 per share tax impact from the sale of our gaming industry check warranty business earlier in the year, and costs pertaining to acquisition-related purchase accounting amortization expense of $0.19 per share.

Adjusted EBITDA increased nineteen percent to $624.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 from $525.6 million in the prior year quarter and was up twenty-one percent on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 32.5 percent compared to 31.1 percent in the prior year period.

The company will sponsor a live webcast of its earnings conference call with the investment community, beginning at 8:30 a.m. (EST) Tuesday, February 9. To access the webcast, go to the Investor Relations section of FIS’ homepage, www.fisglobal.com. A replay will be available after the conclusion of the live webcast.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information 

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the company has provided non-GAAP financial measures, which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. For these reasons, management also uses these measures in part to assess its performance. 

These non-GAAP measures include constant currency revenue, adjusted revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations (including per share amounts), adjusted cash flow from operations, free cash flow and organic revenue.

Adjusted revenue (2014) includes reported revenue and is increased by $9 million for a negotiated contract cash settlement for the extinguishment of certain contractual minimums with a reseller. Although the 2014 cash settlement has no contractual performance obligation, under GAAP the cash settlement revenue is amortized in this circumstance over the remaining relationship with the reseller. 

Adjusted revenue (2015) includes reported revenue and is increased to adjust for the purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment to estimated fair value, determined as fulfillment cost plus a normal profit margin. The deferred revenue adjustment represents revenue that would have been recognized in the normal course of business by SunGard but was not recognized due to GAAP purchase accounting adjustments.

Constant currency revenue is reported revenue excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the current year. 

Adjusted constant currency basis reflects adjusted revenue excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

EBITDA reflects earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-recurring or unusual in nature, the removal of which improves comparability of operating results across reporting periods.

Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations excludes the after tax impact of certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-recurring or unusual in nature, the removal of which improves comparability of operating results across reporting periods. It also excludes the after tax impact of acquisition-related purchase accounting amortization, which is recurring.

Adjusted net earnings per diluted share, or adjusted EPS, reflects adjusted net earnings divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding.

Adjusted cash flow from operations reflects GAAP cash flow from operations as adjusted for the net change in settlement assets and obligations, and excludes certain transactions that are closely associated with non-operating activities or are otherwise non-recurring or unusual in nature and not indicative of future operating cash flows.

Free cash flow reflects adjusted operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since we have mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure.

Organic revenue growth includes current period reported revenue excluding the impact of foreign currency translation over an adjusted prior period excluding impact of acquisitions and divestitures.

Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Further, FIS’ non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures, including footnotes describing the specific adjustments, are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS web site, www.fisglobal.com.

Notes to Unaudited - Supplemental GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation for the three months and years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

The adjustments are as follows:

(1)This column represents the impact of the purchase accounting adjustment to reduce SunGard's deferred revenues to estimated fair value, determined as fulfillment cost plus a normal profit margin. The deferred revenue adjustment represents revenue that would have been recognized in the normal course of business by SunGard but was not recognized due to GAAP purchase accounting requirements. 

(2)This column represents non-recurring transaction and other costs, including integration activities, related to acquisitions and other severance costs.

(3)This column represents gain on the sale of check warranty contracts and other assets in the gaming industry. The sale did not meet the standard necessary to be reported as discontinued operations and, therefore, the gain and related prior period earnings remain reported within earnings from continuing operations. The income tax adjustment for the three months ended December 31, 2015 represents the current quarter tax rate impact of the gain recorded earlier in the year.

(4)The Global Restructure column represents severance costs incurred in connection with the reorganization and streamlining of operations in our Global Financial Solutions segment in order to focus on growth and specific market demands of clientele in that market.  

(5)This column represents the write-off of certain previously capitalized debt issuance costs and the payment of a $29.5 million bond premium associated with the early redemption of certain debt.

(6)The revenue adjustment in this column represents a cash settlement for the extinguishment of certain contractual minimums with a reseller. Although the 2014 cash settlement has no contract performance obligation, revenue is amortized in this circumstance over the remaining relationship with the reseller.

(7)This column represents purchase price amortization expense on all intangible assets acquired through various Company acquisitions including customer relationships, contract value, trademarks and tradenames, and non-compete agreements. Beginning with the 2015 acquisition of SunGard, this column also includes the incremental amortization associated with purchase price adjustments to technology assets acquired. The allocation of purchase price for SunGard to assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2015 is provisional and may be adjusted in future periods. The financial statements will not be retrospectively adjusted for any adjustments to provisional amounts that occur in subsequent periods. Rather, we will recognize any adjustments in the reporting period in which the adjustment is determined. We will also be required to record, in the same period’s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of any change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.
