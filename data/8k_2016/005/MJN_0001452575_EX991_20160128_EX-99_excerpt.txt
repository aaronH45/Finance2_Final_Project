 MEAD JOHNSON NUTRITION DELIVERS EARNINGS PER SHARE ABOVE GUIDANCE

FOR FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2015; 

PROVIDES 2016 GUIDANCE

GLENVIEW, Ill., January 28, 2016 - Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (NYSE: MJN) today announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015. 

“I am pleased with the sequential improvements in our underlying business since our last earnings call, despite a challenging operating environment across many of the emerging markets," said Kasper Jakobsen, Chief Executive Officer. "Our two biggest businesses in China and the United States both posted sales above the levels experienced in the third quarter. I am also pleased that our Fuel for Growth initiative and our focus on operating expenses allowed us to deliver earnings per share above expectations within the fourth quarter."

Highlights are as follows:

•Full year 2015 non-GAAP EBIT was in-line with 2014 on a constant dollar basis. On a GAAP basis, EBIT was 5% below the prior year. 

•During the fourth quarter, the company repurchased 10.7 million shares of stock under an accelerated share repurchase agreement. As of December 31, 2015, 186.4 million shares were outstanding. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Full year 2016 constant dollar sales are expected at 0% to 2% compared to 2015. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, this will translate to 4% to 6% below prior year on a reported basis. 

(1) Fourth quarter sales were down 1% from the third quarter on a reported basis, and flat on a constant dollar basis, compared to the third quarter. Excluding the impact of sales in Venezuela, fourth quarter sales on a constant dollar basis increased 1% compared to the third quarter.

(2) Constant dollar figures exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are reconciled in the tables in the body of this earnings release. Non-GAAP or as adjusted results exclude Specified Items. For a description of Specified Items, and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP, see the schedules titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Results.”

•Full year 2016 non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $3.48 to $3.60, excluding expected future costs related to Fuel for Growth and mark-to-market pension adjustments which are not reflected in this guidance. The company expects to incur charges approximating $25 to $30 million associated with the Fuel for Growth program in 2016. Specified Items including charges related to Fuel for Growth are expected to be approximately $0.12 per share. Therefore GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.36 to $3.48, excluding mark-to-market pension adjustments which cannot be estimated. EPS guidance includes an estimated adverse impact of current exchange rates as of January 2016, which is expected to be approximately $0.40 per share.

Fourth Quarter 2015 

(Dollars in Millions)

(UNAUDITED)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Sales in all segments were adversely impacted by a strengthening dollar, most notably in China, Mexico and Canada.

•In Asia, improvement was seen in Greater China in the fourth quarter of 2015 when compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to the recently launched fully-imported range of products. 

•Further, sales in the current quarter were below the prior year quarter mostly due to price-based promotions in Greater China and market share weakness in Malaysia and Thailand. Sales in the Philippines increased compared to the prior year quarter.

•In Latin America sales decreased compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to intentionally reduced shipments into Venezuela prompted by delayed settlement of inventory related U.S. dollar payables. Sales in the remainder of the segment increased on a constant dollar basis as sales of premium infant products increased in Mexico and Colombia and the ability to implement inflation-related price increases in Argentina. The sales impact of these factors was offset by the effect of price-based competition on the volume of Milk Modifier brands in Mexico. 

•The North America/Europe segment sales were flat in the fourth quarter of 2015 when compared to a strong 2014, on a constant dollar basis. On a sequential basis, continued momentum in North America children's products and European allergy products resulted in an increase in sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 when compared to the third quarter of 2015.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Non-GAAP EBIT was 3% below the prior year quarter on a constant dollar basis. Gross margin improvements were attributable to favorable dairy costs across all segments but were not sufficient to fully offset the impact of reduced sales and increased brand investments.

Page 2 of 10

•In Asia, operational expenses increased due to investments in growth initiatives, notably the fully-imported product launches in China and the establishment of plastic packaging formats across a number of markets. Inflationary cost increases also impacted EBIT.

•In Latin America, operational expenses were higher on a constant dollar basis due to investments in brand support. Excluding the impact of the Venezuela business, the segment's EBIT margin increased compared to the prior year quarter.

•North America/Europe delivered higher EBIT primarily due to improved gross margins.

•Corporate and Other expenses decreased on a reported basis primarily due to actuarial gains in the current quarter compared to actuarial losses in the prior year quarter and lower provisions for incentive compensation in the current quarter. Provisions related to Fuel for Growth partially offset lower operating expenses. 

•On a sequential non-GAAP basis, Corporate and Other expenses were lower mainly as a result of the Fuel for Growth initiative.

Full Year 2015

(Dollars in Millions)

(UNAUDITED)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Sales in all segments were adversely impacted by a strengthening dollar, most notably in China, Mexico and Canada.

•In Asia, increased price-based promotional competition enabled by lower dairy input costs resulted in sales below prior year level.

•Especially China, Thailand and Malaysia experienced weakness with the Philippines and Vietnam performing relatively better. The launch of a fully-imported range of products helped the China business show some improvements towards the end of the year. 

•In Latin America, sales increased on a constant dollar basis in almost all markets. The primary driver was better pricing in Colombia and Argentina. Mexico's performance was negatively impacted as a result of price-based promotional competition in the Milk Modifiers category. However, across the region pricing failed to fully offset the adverse impact of foreign exchange.

•Shipments to Venezuela were intentionally reduced in the second half of the year as access to dollars required to settle intercompany payables became more difficult. 

•North America/Europe delivered sales growth in virtually all markets on a constant dollar basis. Key drivers included a favorable change in product mix as well as better realized pricing throughout the segment. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Non-GAAP EBIT was broadly in-line with the prior year on a constant dollar basis. The impact of reduced sales and increased demand-generation spending was offset by reduced dairy costs and lower operating expenses.

Page 3 of 10

•In Asia, operating expenses increased due to higher expenditures on advertising and promotion required to support competitiveness and new product launches. Overall, these factors combined with lower sales negatively impacted profit margins for the segment.

•Latin America EBIT margin was similar to the prior year as sales decreases and investment spending were offset by improved gross margin due to lower dairy input costs. 

•North America/Europe EBIT margin strengthened due to increased volumes, improved product mix and lower dairy input costs.

•Corporate and Other expenses decreased in the current year from lower incentive compensation, savings from the Fuel for Growth operating expense initiative, and reduced losses related to the re-measurement of our pension and other post-employment benefit plans.

Cash Flow Items and Share Repurchases

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Investing activities include capital expenditures of $173.7 million for 2015. This included investments in capacity expansion for manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and our European plant to accommodate demand for new products.

•Financing activities include cash outflows of $1,437.0 million for the repurchase of approximately 16.4 million shares of stock under the company's 2013 and 2015 share repurchase authorizations with additional settlement under the accelerated share repurchase agreement expected in 2016. These purchases were funded with long-term debt of $1.5 billion issued in 2015. Long-term debt was approximately $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2015. 

•The company's net debt was $1,282.6 million, consisting of debt and cash and cash equivalents.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Dividends declared in 2015 were $1.65 per share, a 10% increase over 2014.

Outlook for 2016 

The company announced full year guidance for 2016. It expects full year constant dollar sales to be in a range of 0% to 2% above 2015 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.48 to $3.60 based on current exchange rates. 

“As discussed during our Investor Day in October of last year we view 2016 as a year of transition as we invest heavily in reshaping our portfolio in China and boost investment in new channels there. We expect modest, single digit EPS growth as a strengthening dollar will continue to challenge the translation of our results. To help investors better understand our underlying performance we will provide constant dollar profit measures through the year,” said Kasper Jakobsen, Chief Executive Officer. He added, “We expect sales growth to accelerate in the second half of the year reflecting the phasing of growth initiatives and investments. Our Fuel for Growth initiative is a critical element of our strategy to help offset the impact of foreign exchange and protect funding for new brand introductions.”

The company expects to incur charges approximating $25 to $30 million associated with the Fuel for Growth program in 2016. Specified Items including charges related to Fuel for Growth are expected to be approximately $0.12 per share. Therefore GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.36 to $3.48, excluding mark-to-market pension adjustments which cannot be estimated. EPS guidance includes an estimated adverse impact of current exchange rates as of January 2016, which is expected to be approximately $0.40 per share.
