Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers  

(d) On January 14, 2016, the board of directors of Discover Financial Services (the “Company”) appointed Joe Eazor as a director of the Company. The board also appointed Mr. Eazor to serve on the Audit Committee on this date. A copy of the press release announcing the appointment of Mr. Eazor is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.  

There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Eazor and any other person pursuant to which Mr. Eazor was selected as a director. There are no transactions involving Mr. Eazor that would be required to be reported under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.  

In connection with his appointment as a director of the Company, Mr. Eazor will be eligible for compensation under the Company’s Directors’ Compensation Plan (the “Plan”). Under the Plan, Mr. Eazor will receive an annual retainer for his service as a director of $90,000 and will receive an annual committee member fee of $20,000 for his service on the Audit Committee, each prorated from the date of his appointment as a director.  

In addition, on January 14, 2016, Mr. Eazor received a grant of 863 restricted stock units under the Plan, which is the annual equity award prorated from the date of his appointment as a director. The restricted stock unit awards vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. All restricted stock unit awards are to be settled in shares of Company common stock. Like other eligible directors under the Plan, Mr. Eazor will be eligible to receive subsequent awards of restricted stock units under the Plan on the date of each annual shareholders meeting. Under the Plan, the amount of such subsequent awards of restricted stock units shall be equal to the number obtained by dividing $130,000 by the fair market value (as defined in the Plan) of a share of Company common stock on such day.
