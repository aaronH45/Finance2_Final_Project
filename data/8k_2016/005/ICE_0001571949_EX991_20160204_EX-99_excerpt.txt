ATLANTA & NEW YORK, February 4, 2016 - Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading operator of global exchanges and clearing houses and provider of data and listings services, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, consolidated net income attributable to ICE was $370 million on $875 million of consolidated revenues less transaction-based expenses. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share (EPS) in the fourth quarter were $3.29 and for the full year 2015 were $11.39. 

ICE's operating results include amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition and integration-related expenses and other adjustments that are not reflective of ICE's cash operations or core business performance. Excluding these items, net of tax, fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net income from continuing operations was $369 million and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations were $3.27, an increase of 26% over the prior fourth quarter. Please refer to the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release for more information on adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. 

"Our record performance in 2015 was driven by strong demand for risk management, trading, data and listings,” said Jeffrey C. Sprecher, ICE Chairman and CEO. "We achieved our double-digit earnings growth target by focusing on our customers, innovating amid a dynamic market environment and with strong financial discipline. All of this has enabled us to again increase our quarterly dividend while investing in growth opportunities. Our acquisition of Interactive Data, together with many other strategic initiatives, positions us well to deliver strong earnings growth again in 2016.” 

Scott A. Hill, ICE CFO, said: “We finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, delivering record earnings growth and executing on our strategic and operational objectives. We expanded operating margins again in 2015 by driving revenue growth and reducing expenses. And we generated solid cash flow, which enabled us to return nearly $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while investing for long-term growth."
