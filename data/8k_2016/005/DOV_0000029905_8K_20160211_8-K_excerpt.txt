Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws; Change in Fiscal Year.

On February 11, 2016, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Dover Corporation (the “Company”) amended and restated the Company’s By-laws (as so amended and restated, the “By-laws”) primarily to implement “proxy access.” Article II, Section 6 has been added to the By-laws to permit a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials director candidates constituting up to the greater of two individuals or 20% of the Board, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the By-laws. Proxy access will first be available to stockholders in connection with the Company’s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders. 

The By-laws were also amended to make clarifications, updates and refinements to the special meeting bylaw contained in Section 3 of Article II and to the advance notice by-laws now contained in Sections 4 and 5 of Article II. In addition, new Section 9(d) of Article II adds a requirement that all nominees for director provide certain information, representations and agreements to the Company in order to be eligible for election, and new Article XV makes explicit the Board’s ability to interpret and make determinations under the By-laws.

This description of the amendments to the By-laws is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the By-laws, a copy of which is included as Exhibit 3.1 to this report and incorporated by reference herein.
