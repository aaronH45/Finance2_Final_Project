The sale, executed at a capitalization rate of 3.8 percent, will generate net proceeds to the Company of approximately $45 million, after giving consideration to the retained investment and the in-place mortgage of $267.7 million, which is scheduled to mature in 2017. The sale is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions.
