CEO Comments 

“Our solid financial and operating performance for the fourth quarter contributed to excellent results in 2015,” said John P. Case, Realty Income’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our 2015 AFFO per share increased 6.6% to $2.74, driven primarily by a near-record volume of property-level acquisitions, favorable pricing and terms on our capital raising activities, and healthy portfolio occupancy. These results supported multiple dividend increases throughout 2015 and at the beginning of 2016. With the payment of the February 2016 dividend, we will have grown our dividend by 5% as compared to the same month a year ago.” 

“In 2015, we completed $1.26 billion in acquisitions, which is our third most active year for acquisitions in the company’s history. We primarily funded our investment activity by issuing $1.2 billion of common equity. Our balance sheet is well-positioned today with approximately 75% of our market capitalization represented by equity, the highest level in ten years. We also currently have $1.63 billion available on our $2 billion credit facility which offers plenty of financial flexibility as we continue to grow our company in 2016.” 

“Our portfolio occupancy at the end of 2015 was 98.4%, up from 98.3% last quarter. We were able to achieve this high level of occupancy despite managing our most active year ever for lease expiration activity. We re-leased 253 properties with expiring leases to existing or new tenants, at rent above our expiring rent.” 

Financial Results 

Revenue 

Revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 increased 6.5% to $263.7 million, as compared to $247.6 million for the same quarter in 2014. Revenue for 2015 increased 9.6% to $1.023 billion, as compared to $933.5 million for 2014. 

Net Income Available to Common Stockholders 

Net income available to common stockholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was $76.2 million, as compared to $71.0 million for the same quarter in 2014. Net income per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 was $0.31, 

as compared to $0.32 for the same quarter in 2014. Net income available to common stockholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was impacted by an unusually large gain on sales of real estate, which represented $0.11 per share. 

Net income available to common stockholders for 2015 was $256.7 million, as compared to $227.6 million for 2014. Net income per share in 2015 was $1.09, as compared to $1.04 for 2014. 

The calculation to determine net income for a real estate company includes impairments and/or gains on property sales. Impairments and/or gains on property sales vary from quarter to quarter. This variance can significantly impact net income and period to period comparisons. 

Funds From Operations (FFO) Available to Common Stockholders 

FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 increased 23.8% to $177.9 million, as compared to $143.7 million for the same quarter in 2014. FFO per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 increased 10.9% to $0.71, as compared to $0.64 for the same quarter in 2014. 

FFO for 2015 increased 15.9% to $652.4 million, as compared to $562.9 million for 2014. FFO per share in 2015 increased 7.4% to $2.77, as compared to $2.58 for 2014. 

Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) Available to Common Stockholders 

AFFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 increased 16.9% to $170.0 million, as compared to $145.4 million for the same quarter in 2014. AFFO per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 increased 4.6% to $0.68, as compared to $0.65 for the same quarter in 2014. 

AFFO for 2015 increased 15.2% to $647.0 million, as compared to $561.7 million for 2014. AFFO per share for 2015 increased 6.6% to $2.74, as compared to $2.57 for 2014. 

The company considers FFO and AFFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of a Real Estate Investment Trust’s (REIT’s) operating performance. Realty Income defines FFO consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s (NAREIT’s) definition, as net income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus impairments of real estate, reduced by gains on sales of investment properties and extraordinary items. AFFO further adjusts FFO for unique revenue and expense items, which the company believes are not as pertinent to the measurement of the company’s ongoing operating performance. See the reconciliations of net income available to common stockholders to FFO and AFFO on pages six and seven. 

Dividend Increases 

In December 2015, Realty Income announced the 73rd consecutive quarterly dividend increase, which is the 83rd increase in the amount of the dividend since the company’s listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994.
