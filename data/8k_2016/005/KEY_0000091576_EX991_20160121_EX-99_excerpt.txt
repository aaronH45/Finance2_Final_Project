CLEVELAND, January 21, 2016 – KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $224 million, or $.27 per common share, compared to $216 million, or $.26 per common share, for the third quarter of 2015, and $246 million, or $.28 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Key incurred merger-related costs and a pension settlement charge totaling $10 million, or $.01 per common share. Key incurred pension settlement charges of $19 million, or $.01 per common share, during the third quarter of 2015, and $3 million during the fourth quarter of 2014.  

For the year ended December 31, 2015, net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders was $892 million, or $1.05 per common share, compared to $917 million, or $1.04 per common share, for the same period one year ago.  

“We were pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year results,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Beth Mooney. “Our fourth quarter results reflect continued revenue growth, well-managed expenses, and strong credit quality.”  

“Full-year results reflect positive operating leverage, driven by a 3% increase in revenue, benefiting from continued loan growth and ongoing momentum in our fee-based businesses. Investment banking and debt placement fees had another record year, and our cards and payments income was up 10%. Expenses reflect the ongoing investments we have made in our businesses to drive revenue growth, including the addition of client-facing personnel across our franchise,” continued Mooney. “Capital ratios also remain strong, and reflect $460 million of common share repurchases and a 16% increase in our common share dividend for the year.”  

“Additionally, we continue to make good progress on our announced acquisition of First Niagara Financial Group. Integration teams, including some of the top talent at both Key and First Niagara, are focused on the approval process and ensuring a smooth transition and sustained momentum,” added Mooney.

FOURTH QUARTER 2015 FINANCIAL RESULTS, from continuing operations  

Compared to Fourth Quarter of 2014  

 •   Average loans up 5%, driven by 14% growth in commercial, financial and agricultural loans  

 •   Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, up 3%, due to strength in the commercial mortgage servicing business and inflows from commercial and consumer clients  

 •   Net interest income (taxable-equivalent) up $22 million, attributable to higher earning asset balances partially offset by lower earning asset yields  

 •   Noninterest income down $5 million, due to lower net gains from principal investing and trust and investment services income, partially offset by increases in cards and payments income, mortgage servicing fees, and other income  

 •   Noninterest expense up $32 million, primarily attributable to an increase in personnel expense related to investments made across the business and higher employee benefits expense, along with merger-related costs  

 •   Credit quality remained strong, with net loan charge-offs to average loans of .25%  

Compared to Third Quarter of 2015  

 •   Average loans up .5%, driven by a 2% increase in commercial, financial and agricultural loans  

 •   Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, up 2%, due to seasonal and short-term deposit inflows from commercial clients, along with growth in NOW and money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit  

 •   Net interest income (taxable-equivalent) up $12 million, driven by higher earning asset yields and loan fees  

 •   Noninterest income up $15 million, primarily due to higher investment banking and debt placement fees  

 •   Noninterest expense up $12 million, primarily driven by higher incentive and stock-based compensation, merger-related costs, and increased costs associated with Key’s continuous improvement and efficiency efforts, partially offset by lower employee benefits expense  

 •   Strong credit quality, with net loan charge-offs to average loans remaining below our targeted range of 40-60 basis points  

Selected Financial Highlights  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) The table entitled “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” in the attached financial supplement presents the computations of certain financial measures related to “Common Equity Tier 1” (compliance date of January 1, 2015, under the Regulatory Capital Rules) and “Tier 1 common equity” (prior to January 1, 2015). The table reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons. For further information on the Regulatory Capital Rules, see the “Capital” section of this release.  

 (b) 12-31-15 ratio is estimated.

INCOME STATEMENT HIGHLIGHTS  

Revenue  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

TE = Taxable Equivalent  

Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $610 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, and the net interest margin was 2.87%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $588 million and a net interest margin of 2.94% for the fourth quarter of 2014. The $22 million increase in net interest income reflects higher earning asset balances, partially offset by lower earning asset yields, which also drove the decline in the net interest margin.  

Compared to the third quarter of 2015, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $12 million, and the net interest margin was unchanged. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to higher earning asset yields and loan fees. The net interest margin was stable as the impact of higher earning asset yields and loan fees was offset by higher levels of excess liquidity driven by short-term commercial deposit growth.  

Noninterest Income  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

N/M = Not Meaningful  

Key’s noninterest income was $485 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $490 million for the year-ago quarter. The slight decrease from the prior year was predominantly attributable to a decline in net gains from principal investing of $18 million and $7 million of lower trust and investment services income reflecting market variability. These decreases were partially offset by a $12 million increase in other income and growth in some of Key’s other core fee-based businesses, including $4 million of higher cards and payments income due to higher credit card and merchant fees and a $4 million increase in mortgage servicing fees.  

Compared to the third quarter of 2015, noninterest income increased by $15 million. The primary driver was $18 million in higher investment banking and debt placement fees, marking a strong finish to a record year. Additionally, there was an $8 million increase in other income and a $6 million increase in corporate-owned life insurance, reflecting normal seasonality. Partially offsetting these increases were a decrease of $11 million in net gains from principal investing and a decline of $4 million in service charges on deposit accounts.

Noninterest Expense  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Key’s noninterest expense was $736 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. During the quarter, Key incurred merger-related costs of $6 million, a pension settlement charge of $4 million, and costs associated with continuous improvement and efficiency efforts of $10 million. These costs impacted both personnel and nonpersonnel expense.  

Compared to $704 million for the fourth quarter of last year, the increase in noninterest expense was primarily attributable to a $20 million increase in personnel expense related to investments made across the business, along with an increase in employee benefits expense. Nonpersonnel expense increased $12 million, most notably from higher business services and professional fees, partially due to merger-related costs.  

Compared to the third quarter of 2015, noninterest expense increased by $12 million. This increase was primarily attributable to higher incentive and stock-based compensation expense as a result of a strong capital markets performance, partially offset by a decrease in employee benefits expense due to a lower pension settlement charge. Additionally, $6 million in merger-related costs contributed to the increase, largely attributable to higher business services and professional fees. Costs associated with Key’s continuous improvement and efficiency efforts also increased $6 million.  

BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS  

In the fourth quarter of 2015, Key had average assets of $96.1 billion compared to $91.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $94.8 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, Key experienced more short-term commercial deposit inflows, which contributed to higher levels of liquidity and drove the increase in average earning assets in the fourth quarter of 2015.  

Average Loans  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Commercial, financial and agricultural average loan balances include $87 million, $88 million, and $90 million of assets from commercial credit cards at December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively.  

Average loans were $59.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $3 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The loan growth occurred in the commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio, which increased $3.7 billion and was broad-based across Key’s commercial lines of business. Consumer loans declined $300 million as a result of the run-off in Key’s consumer exit portfolios.  

Compared to the third quarter of 2015, average loans increased by $295 million, driven by commercial, financial and agricultural loans, which grew $510 million.

Average Deposits  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Excludes deposits in foreign office.  

N/A = Not Applicable  

Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $71.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $2.3 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. NOW and money market deposit accounts increased by $2.8 billion, reflecting growth in the commercial mortgage servicing business and inflows from commercial and consumer clients. This increase was partially offset by declines in certificates of deposit and other time deposits.  

Compared to the third quarter of 2015, average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, increased by $1.5 billion. This increase was driven by both seasonal and short-term deposit inflows from commercial clients, along with growth in NOW and money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit.  

ASSET QUALITY  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Loan balances exclude $11 million, $12 million, and $13 million of purchased credit impaired loans at December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively.  

N/A = Not Applicable  

Key’s provision for credit losses was $45 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $22 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and $45 million for the third quarter of 2015. Key’s allowance for loan and lease losses was $796 million, or 1.33% of total period-end loans, at December 31, 2015, compared to 1.38% at December 31, 2014, and 1.31% at September 30, 2015.  

Net loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2015 totaled $37 million, or .25% of average total loans. These results compare to $32 million, or .22%, for the fourth quarter of 2014, and $41 million, or .27%, for the third quarter of 2015.  

At December 31, 2015, Key’s nonperforming loans totaled $387 million and represented .65% of period-end portfolio loans, compared to ..73% at December 31, 2014, and .67% at September 30, 2015. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2015 totaled $403 million and represented .67% of period-end portfolio loans and OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to .76% at December 31, 2014, and .69% at September 30, 2015.

CAPITAL  

Key’s estimated risk-based capital ratios included in the following table continued to exceed all “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks at December 31, 2015.  

Capital Ratios  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) 12-31-15 ratio is estimated.  

 (b) The table entitled “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” in the attached financial supplement presents the computations of certain financial measures related to “Common Equity Tier 1” (compliance date of January 1, 2015, under the Regulatory Capital Rules) and “Tier 1 common equity” (prior to January 1, 2015). The table reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons. See below for further information on the Regulatory Capital Rules.  

As shown in the preceding table, at December 31, 2015, Key’s estimated Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios stood at 10.95% and 11.36%, respectively. In addition, the tangible common equity ratio was 9.98% at December 31, 2015.  

In October 2013, federal banking regulators published the final Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Regulatory Capital Rules”). The mandatory compliance date for Key as a “standardized approach” banking organization began on January 1, 2015, subject to transitional provisions extending to January 1, 2019. Key’s estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio as calculated under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules was 10.85% at December 31, 2015. This estimate exceeds the fully phased-in required minimum Common Equity Tier 1 and Capital Conservation Buffer of 7.00%.  

Summary of Changes in Common Shares Outstanding  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

N/M = Not Meaningful  

During 2015, Key repurchased $460 million of common shares and increased its quarterly common share dividend by 15% in the second quarter.  

As previously reported, Key’s existing share repurchase program is suspended through the second quarter of 2016. Share repurchases are expected to be included in the upcoming 2016 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review submission.

LINE OF BUSINESS RESULTS  

The following table shows the contribution made by each major business segment to Key’s taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing operations and income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key for the periods presented. For more detailed financial information pertaining to each business segment, see the tables at the end of this release.  

As previously reported, in the third quarter of 2015, Key enhanced the approach used to determine the commercial reserve factors used in estimating the quantitative component of the commercial allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, Key began utilizing an enhanced framework to quantify commercial allowance for loan and lease loss adjustments resulting from qualitative factors not fully captured within the statistical analysis of incurred loss. These methodology enhancements did not create a significant difference in provisioning between segments.

Additional Key Community Bank Data  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Key Community Bank Summary of Operations  

 •   Positive operating leverage from prior year  

 •   Net income increased to $68 million, up 9.7% from prior year  

 •   Commercial, financial and agricultural loan growth of $672 million, or 5.6% from prior year  

 •   Average deposits up $1.4 billion, or 2.7% from the prior year  

Key Community Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $68 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to net income attributable to Key of $62 million for the year-ago quarter.  

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $26 million, or 7.2%, from the fourth quarter of 2014 due to increases in average loans and leases of 1.5% and average deposits of 2.7% from one year ago. Commercial, financial and agricultural loans grew by $672 million, or 5.6%, from the prior year.  

Noninterest income increased $4 million, or 2.0%, from the year-ago quarter. This growth was driven by increases in cards and payments income of $4 million and strong investment banking and debt placement fees, which increased $4 million from one year ago. These increases were partially offset by lower trust and investment services income due to weaker market trends.  

The provision for credit losses increased by $9 million, or 82%, from the fourth quarter of 2014. Net loan charge-offs decreased $5 million from the same period one year ago.  

Noninterest expense increased by $10 million, or 2.2%, from the year-ago quarter. Personnel expense increased by $8 million, driven by hiring across the franchise as well as higher performance-based compensation, while nonpersonnel expense increased by $2 million.

 •   Average loan and lease balances up 13.4% from the prior year  

Key Corporate Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $145 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $4 million, or 2.7%, from the same period one year ago.  

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $5 million, or 2.3%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Average earning assets increased $3.1 billion, or 12.1%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by growth in commercial, financial and agricultural loans. Average deposit balances increased $726 million, or 4.0%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by commercial mortgage servicing deposits.  

Noninterest income was up $14 million, or 5.8% from the prior year. Other noninterest income increased $18 million mostly driven by gains related to the disposition of certain investments held by the Real Estate Capital line of business. Mortgage servicing fees increased $4 million, or 36.4%, due to higher

 transaction volumes. Partially offsetting these increases were declines in trust and investment services income of $5 million and operating lease income and other leasing gains of $4 million.  

The provision for credit losses increased $19 million, or 271.4%, from the same period one year ago, primarily due to higher net loan charge-offs, as well as a 13.4% increase in average loan and lease balances.  

Noninterest expense increased by $10 million, or 4.1%, from the fourth quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily driven by higher personnel expense due to new hires across the platform and an increase in business services and professional fees.

Other Segments consist of Corporate Treasury, Key’s Principal Investing unit and various exit portfolios. Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $23 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $38 million for the same period last year. This decline was primarily attributable to lower net gains from principal investing.

 (a) In April 2009, management decided to wind down the operations of Austin Capital Management, Ltd., a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers. In September 2009, management decided to discontinue the education lending business conducted through Key Education Resources, the education payment and financing unit of KeyBank National Association. In February 2013, Key decided to sell its investment subsidiary, Victory Capital Management, and its broker-dealer affiliate, Victory Capital Advisors, to a private equity fund. As a result of these decisions, Key has accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations  

(dollars in millions)  

The table below presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to “tangible common equity,” “return on tangible common equity,” “Common Equity Tier 1,” “Tier 1 common equity,” “pre-provision net revenue,” and “cash efficiency ratio.”  

The tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing Key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. In October 2013, the federal banking regulators published the final Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Regulatory Capital Rules”). The Regulatory Capital Rules require higher and better-quality capital and introduces a new capital measure, “Common Equity Tier 1,” a non-GAAP financial measure. The mandatory compliance date for Key as a “standardized approach” banking organization began on January 1, 2015, subject to transitional provisions extending to January 1, 2019. Prior to January 1, 2015, the Federal Reserve focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital known as Tier 1 common equity, also a non-GAAP financial measure.  

Common Equity Tier 1 is not formally defined by GAAP and is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Key’s capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Common Equity Tier 1, management believes it is useful to enable investors to assess Key’s capital adequacy on these same bases. The table also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.  

The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze the results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.  

The cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-GAAP performance measures. As such, there is no directly comparable GAAP performance measure. The cash efficiency ratio performance measure removes the impact of Key’s intangible asset amortization from the calculation. Management believes this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between Key’s results and those of its peer banks. Additionally, this ratio is used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.  

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
