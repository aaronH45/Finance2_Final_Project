 GREENSBORO, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 19, 2016--VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended January 2, 2016. All per share amounts are on a diluted basis. This release refers to amounts as “reported”, “currency neutral” and “adjusted.” Currency neutral and adjusted amounts are non-GAAP financial measures described below under the “Currency Neutral – Excluding the Impact of Foreign Currency” and “Adjusted Amounts – Excluding Noncash Impairment Charges” paragraphs, respectively. Unless otherwise noted, currency neutral and reported amounts are the same. This release also refers to the impact of the 53rd week of 2014, as described under the “52/53 Week Fiscal Year” paragraph.  

 “The final quarter of 2015 challenged many companies to leverage core strengths and adapt quickly to a changing landscape,” said Eric Wiseman, VF Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Our focus, discipline and agility amid a softer consumer environment, record warm weather and a strengthening U.S. dollar have us well positioned to navigate what we believe to be a relatively short-term challenge. Going forward, I remain confident in VF’s ability to deliver continued long-term profitable growth and value creation for our shareholders.”  

 “Our full year 2015 was also affected by many of the same challenges we saw in the fourth quarter, including a tough comparison against 2014’s 53rd week,” continued Wiseman. “In fact, when normalized over 2014 and 2015, currency neutral revenue grew 7 percent and earnings grew 13 percent annually over this period, in line with our long-term earnings growth target.”  

 Fourth Quarter 2015 Review   

 Revenue was down 5 percent (down 1 percent currency neutral). Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency and the 53rd week, fourth quarter revenue increased 3 percent.  

 Gross margin was 49.0 percent on a currency neutral basis, in line with last year. Reported gross margin was down 70 basis points to 48.3 percent as benefits from more favorable product costs and continued mix shift to higher margin businesses were offset by foreign currency headwinds and aggressive efforts to manage inventory.  

 A $144 million pre-tax, noncash impairment charge ($0.23 per share after tax) was recorded to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets related to our 7 For All Mankind®, Ella Moss® and Splendid® brands.  

 Operating income, on an adjusted basis, declined 6 percent to $541 million in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter operating income was $397 million. Adjusted operating margin reached 15.8 percent, net of 70 basis points of foreign currency headwinds, compared with 16.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter operating margin was 11.6 percent compared with 5.1 percent in last year’s same period.  

 Adjusted earnings per share was $0.95 per share compared with $0.98 per share during the same period last year. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was up 5 percent. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share was up 157 percent to $0.72.   

 The following table provides comparisons of changes in reported, currency neutral, and currency neutral excluding the 53rd week revenue growth rates for the fourth quarter of 2015.

 Full Year 2015 Review   

 Revenue increased 1 percent (up 6 percent currency neutral) to $12.4 billion driven by strength in our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition, and our international and direct-to-consumer platforms. For comparison purposes, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency and the 53rd week, full year revenue increased 7 percent.  

 Gross margin on a currency neutral basis improved 30 basis points to 49.1 percent. Reported gross margin was 48.3 percent, compared with 48.8 percent in 2014. For the full year, a continued shift in our revenue mix toward higher-margin businesses and more favorable product costs was more than offset by an 80 basis point negative impact from changes in foreign currency and aggressive efforts to manage inventory.  

 Operating income on an adjusted basis was $1.8 billion, in line with 2014. On a GAAP basis, full year operating income was $1.7 billion. Adjusted operating margin was 14.6 percent in 2015, net of 70 basis points of foreign currency headwinds, compared with 14.9 percent in 2014. On a GAAP basis, operating margin was 13.4 percent in 2015 compared with 11.7 percent in 2014.  

 Adjusted earnings per share was in line with 2014 adjusted EPS of $3.08 per share (up 12 percent currency neutral). On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share was $2.85, an increase of 20 percent compared with 2014.   

 The following table provides comparisons of changes in reported, currency neutral, and currency neutral excluding the 53rd week revenue growth rates for the full year 2015.

 Adjusted Amounts – Excluding Noncash Impairment Charges  

 As a result of our annual review of intangible assets, we recorded a $144 million pre-tax, noncash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2015 to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets related to our 7 For All Mankind®, Ella Moss® and Splendid® brands. On an after-tax basis, the charge totaled $97 million, which decreased fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings per share by $0.23.  

 In 2014, we recorded a $396 million pre-tax, noncash impairment charge in the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets related to our 7 For All Mankind®, Ella Moss® and Splendid® brands. On an after-tax basis, the charge totaled $307 million, which decreased fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings per share by $0.70.  

 All “adjusted amounts” referenced herein exclude the effects of these noncash impairment charges. Reconciliations of measures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) to adjusted amounts are presented in the supplemental financial information included with this release, which identify and quantify all excluded items.  

 Currency Neutral – Excluding the Impact of Foreign Currency  

 This release refers to “currency neutral” amounts for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, and 2016 outlook. Currency neutral amounts exclude both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of currency rate changes on foreign currency denominated transactions. This release also refers to “reported” amounts in accordance with GAAP, which include translation and transactional impacts from foreign currency exchange rates. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency neutral amounts for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 are presented in the attached supplemental financial information, which identify and quantify all excluded items.  

 52/53 Week Fiscal Year  

 VF operates and reports using a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year, and as a result, a 53rd week is added every five or six years. VF’s 2014 fiscal year included a 53rd week, which was the week ended January 3, 2015. Similarly, while fiscal quarters normally consist of 13-week periods, the fourth quarter of 2014 included a 14th week. For comparability between 2015 and 2014 financial results, certain estimates referenced herein exclude the impact of the 53rd week of 2014, which added approximately 1 percent of revenue growth.  

 2016 Outlook  

 “Going forward, we believe the current environment provides a significant opportunity for VF. With history as our teacher, we know that powerful brands and companies with strong balance sheets can capitalize on environments like this. That is exactly our intention,” continued Wiseman. “By focusing on our strengths – driving innovation into the marketplace, telling great stories to connect with consumers and operating with financial discipline – we will seize this opportunity to complete 2016 better positioned than we ever have been.”  

 Key points related to VF’s full year 2016 outlook include:   

 Revenue is expected to increase at a mid single-digit percentage rate, including about one percentage point of negative impact from changes in foreign currency. By coalition, revenue for Outdoor & Action Sports is expected to increase at a high single-digit percentage rate; mid single-digit growth for Jeanswear; low single-digit growth for Imagewear; a slight decline in Sportswear; and, a mid single-digit decline in the Contemporary Brands business.  

 International revenue is expected to increase at a high single-digit rate on a currency neutral basis (up mid single-digit reported). European revenue is expected to be up at a mid single-digit rate currency neutral (up low single-digit rate reported). In the Asia Pacific region, full year currency neutral revenue is expected to increase at a low double-digit percentage rate (up high single-digit reported). And in the Americas (non-U.S.) region, revenue is expected to be up at a low-teen percentage rate currency neutral (up low single-digit reported).  

 Direct-to-consumer revenue is expected to grow at a low double-digit percentage rate, including about a point of negative impact from changes in foreign currency. Direct-to-consumer growth in 2016 will be driven by an increase of approximately 80 stores and comparable sales growth including an expected increase of more than 20 percent in e-commerce revenue.  

 Gross margin is expected to improve by about 50 basis points to 48.8 percent, which includes about 70 basis points of headwind from changes in foreign currency.  

 Operating margin is expected to reach 14.4 percent, including about 70 basis points from the anticipated negative impact of changes in foreign currency.  

 Earnings per share, on a currency neutral basis, is expected to increase 11 percent (up 5 percent reported) compared to an adjusted EPS of $3.08 in 2015.  

 Cash flow from operations is expected to reach $1.3 billion.  

 VF expects to spend approximately $1 billion under the company’s share repurchase program. This represents a more than 35 percent increase over repurchases made in 2015, and when combined with the annual dividend, should return $1.5 billion to shareholders in 2016.  

 Other full year assumptions include an approximate 23 percent effective tax rate and capital expenditures of approximately $300 million.   

 In the first quarter of 2016, we expect currency neutral revenue and earnings per share to be about flat. On a reported basis, revenue in the first quarter is expected to be about flat and earnings per share is expected to be down at a low double-digit percentage rate. In the second quarter of 2016, revenue should increase at a low single-digit percentage rate with a low single-digit decline in currency neutral earnings per share, or down high single-digit as reported. The second quarter of 2015 benefitted from a lower tax rate related to the settlement of prior years’ tax audits. Currency neutral revenue growth in the second half of 2016 should increase at a high single-digit percentage rate, with the strongest performance coming in the fourth quarter. We expect second half earnings per share to increase at a mid to high-teen percentage rate.  

 Dividend Declared  

 VF’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, payable on March 18, 2016 to shareholders of record on March 8, 2016.
