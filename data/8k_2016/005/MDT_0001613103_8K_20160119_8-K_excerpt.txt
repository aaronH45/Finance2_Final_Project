Item 8.01 Other Events.

Medtronic plc (“the Company”), as a result of its acquisition of Covidien, is a successor to Covidien under a Tax Sharing Agreement dated September 25, 2007, among the Company (as successor to Covidien), Tyco International plc and TE Connectivity (together, the “Tax Sharing Participants”). Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Tax Sharing Participants share certain tax liabilities associated with the tax year 2007 and prior years. On January 15, 2016, Tyco International plc, as Audit Managing Party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, entered into Stipulations of Settled Issues with the United States Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) intended to resolve all disputes related to the previously disclosed intercompany debt issues for the Tax Sharing Participants for the 1997 - 2000 audit cycle, currently before the United States Tax Court. The Stipulations of Settled Issues are contingent upon the IRS Appeals Division applying the same settlement to all intercompany debt issues on appeal for subsequent audit cycles (2001 - 2007) and the approval of the United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation, if required. 

If finalized, the tentative resolution would cover all aspects of the controversy before the U.S. Tax Court and the Appeals Division of the IRS, and would result in a total cash payment by the Tax Sharing Participants to the IRS in the range of $475 million to $525 million, which includes all interest and penalties. This payment would be shared among the Tax Sharing Participants according to the formula in the Tax Sharing Agreement, and would be split among the Company, Tyco International plc and TE Connectivity 42%, 27%, and 31%, respectively.

The Company does not expect to recognize any additional charges related to the tentative resolution, as the Company had previously recorded sufficient reserves with respect to this controversy and its obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Any income tax reserves and associated receivables will not be adjusted until final resolution is reached. In the event these adjustments result in a material non-cash gain, the Company would exclude this gain from its non-GAAP earnings. 

The Tax Sharing Participants expect payment to be made to the IRS and among the parties within the next six months.
