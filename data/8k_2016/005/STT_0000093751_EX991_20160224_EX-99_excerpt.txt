2 Forward-looking statements This presentation contains forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws, including statements relating to our goals and expectations regarding our business, financial and capital condition, results of operations, investment portfolio performance and strategies, the financial and market outlook, governmental and regulatory initiatives and developments, and the business environment. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by such forward-looking terminology as “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “future,” “forward,” “vision,” “priority,” “objective,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “seek,” “may,” “will,”, “focus”, “trend,” “target,” “strategy” and “goal,” or similar statements or variations of such terms. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, are inherently uncertain, are based on current assumptions that are difficult to predict and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in those statements, and those statements should not be relied upon as representing our expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to February 24, 2016. Important factors that may affect future results and outcomes include, but are not limited to: the financial strength and continuing viability of the counterparties with which we or our clients do business and to which we have investment, credit or financial exposure, including, for example, the direct and indirect effects on counterparties of the sovereign-debt risks in the U.S., Europe and other regions; increases in the volatility of, or declines in the level of, our net interest revenue, changes in the composition or valuation of the assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition (and our ability to measure the fair value of investment securities) and the possibility that we may change the manner in which we fund those assets; the liquidity of the U.S. and international securities markets, particularly the markets for fixed- income securities and inter-bank credits, and the liquidity requirements of our clients; the level and volatility of interest rates, the valuation of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which we record revenue or accrue expenses and the performance and volatility of securities, credit, currency and other markets in the U.S. and internationally; the credit quality, credit-agency ratings and fair values of the securities in our investment securities portfolio, a deterioration or downgrade of which could lead to other-than-temporary impairment of the respective securities and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of income; our ability to attract deposits and other low-cost, short-term funding, the relative portion of our deposits that are determined to be operational under regulatory guidelines and our ability to deploy deposits in a profitable manner consistent with our liquidity requirements and risk profile; the manner and timing with which the Federal Reserve and other U.S. and foreign regulators implement changes to the regulatory framework applicable to our operations, including implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Basel III final rule and European legislation (such as the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directives); among other consequences, these regulatory changes impact the levels of regulatory capital we must maintain, acceptable levels of credit exposure to third parties, margin requirements applicable to derivatives, and restrictions on banking and financial activities. In addition, our regulatory posture and related expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in regulatory expectations for global systemically important financial institutions applicable to, among other things, risk management, capital planning and compliance programs, and changes in governmental enforcement approaches to perceived failures to comply with regulatory or legal obligations; adverse changes in the regulatory ratios that we are required or will be required to meet, whether arising under the Dodd-Frank Act or the Basel III final rule, or due to changes in regulatory positions, practices or regulations in jurisdictions in which we engage in banking activities, including changes in internal or external data, formulae, models, assumptions or other advanced systems used in the calculation of our capital ratios that cause changes in those ratios as they are measured from period to period; increasing requirements to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve or our other U.S. and non-U.S. regulators for the use, allocation or distribution of our capital or other specific capital actions or programs, including acquisitions, dividends and stock purchases, without which our growth plans, distributions to shareholders, share repurchase programs or other capital initiatives may be restricted; changes in law or regulation, or the enforcement of law or regulation, that may adversely affect our business activities or those of our clients or our counterparties, and the products or services that we sell, including additional or increased taxes or assessments thereon, capital adequacy requirements, margin requirements and changes that expose us to risks related to the adequacy of our controls or compliance programs; financial market disruptions or economic recession, whether in the U.S., Europe, Asia or other regions; our ability to promote a strong culture of risk management, operating controls, compliance oversight and governance that meet our expectations and those of our clients and our regulators; the results of, and costs associated with, governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, litigation and similar claims, disputes, or proceedings; the potential for losses arising from our investments in sponsored investment funds; the possibility that our clients will incur substantial losses in investment pools for which we act as agent, and the possibility of significant reductions in the liquidity or valuation of assets underlying those pools; our ability to anticipate and manage the level and timing of redemptions and withdrawals from our collateral pools and other collective investment products; the credit agency ratings of our debt and depository obligations and investor and client perceptions of our financial strength; adverse publicity, whether specific to State Street or regarding other industry participants or industry-wide factors, or other reputational harm; our ability to control operational risks, data security breach risks and outsourcing risks, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, the possibility of errors in the quantitative models we use to manage our business and the possibility that our controls will prove insufficient, fail or be circumvented; our ability to expand our use of technology to enhance the efficiency, accuracy and reliability of our operations and our dependencies on information technology and our ability to control related risks, including cyber-crime and other threats to our information technology infrastructure and systems and their effective operation both independently and with external systems, and complexities and costs of protecting the security of our systems and data; our ability to grow revenue, manage expenses, attract and retain highly skilled people and raise the capital necessary to achieve our business goals and comply with regulatory requirements and expectations; changes or potential changes to the competitive environment, including changes due to regulatory and technological changes, the effects of industry consolidation and perceptions of State Street as a suitable service provider or counterparty; changes or potential changes in the amount of compensation we receive from clients for our services, and the mix of services provided by us that clients choose; our ability to complete acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures, including the ability to obtain regulatory approvals, the ability to arrange financing as required and the ability to satisfy closing conditions; the risks that our acquired businesses and joint ventures will not achieve their anticipated financial and operational benefits or will not be integrated successfully, or that the integration will take longer than anticipated, that expected synergies will not be achieved or unexpected negative synergies or liabilities will be experienced, that client and deposit retention goals will not be met, that other regulatory or operational challenges will be experienced, and that disruptions from the transaction will harm our relationships with our clients, our employees or regulators; our ability to recognize emerging needs of our clients and to develop products that are responsive to such trends and profitable to us, the performance of and demand for the products and services we offer, and the potential for new products and services to impose additional costs on us and expose us to increased operational risk; changes in accounting standards and practices; and changes in tax legislation and in the interpretation of existing tax laws by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities that affect the amount of taxes due. Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward-looking statements are set forth in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent SEC filings. We encourage investors to read these filings, particularly the sections on risk factors, for additional information with respect to any forward-looking statements and prior to making any investment decision. The forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of the date hereof, February 24, 2016, and we do not undertake efforts to revise those forward-looking statements to reflect events after that date.

Actual expenses may increase or decrease in the future due to other factors. 4 If current rates persist for an extended period of time, NIR may track lower than the range provided. Also, NIR will depend on the size of our balance sheet and client deposit behavior. 2016 Outlook1: Environment continues to be challenging and managing our expenses is a high priority • Environment continues to be challenging in 2016 and managing expenses is a high priority: – Expect to generate positive fee operating leverage2 relative to 2015 – Targeting approximately $100M in estimated annual pre-tax net run-rate expense savings3 from State Street Beacon in 2016 (includes targeted staff reductions announced in October) – Expect restructuring charges as State Street Beacon progresses, potentially beginning in 1Q16 – Expect the incremental amount attributed to equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes in 1Q16 to be in the range of $130M to $140M. This compares to $137M in 1Q15 • Expect operating-basis NIR for 2016 in the following scenarios to be: – Static: Approximately $2,025 - $2,125M assuming market rates to at December 31, 2015 levels4 – Rising: Approximately $2,100 - $2,200M assuming U.S. central bank rate hikes of 0.25% both in March and June and U.K. central bank rate hikes of 0.25% both in May and August; correspondingly, expect market rates to trend higher from December 31, 2015 levels4 • Expect operating-basis effective tax rate to be 30-32% • Expect preferred dividends on outstanding preferred shares as of December 31, 2015 to be $155M in 2016 ($48.6M in 1Q16, $28.9M in 2Q16, $48.6M in 3Q16 and $28.9M in 4Q16) • 2016 capital plan remains subject to review by the Federal Reserve Board

Operating-basis expense growth outlook assumes that in 2016 that there will be reasonable outcome for regulatory framework or expectations. Refer to the addendum linked to this presentation for explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures. Focus is on managing through the challenging environment Short-term challenges and actions: • Weak global growth and lower equity markets • Low interest rate environment • Focused on expense management: – State Street Beacon 2016 expense savings: – Management layers and spans – End-to-end review of controllable expense categories Expect modest operating-basis1 expense growth: • Full year 2015 to full year 2016 to be approximately 2%, with variability across quarters Medium to long-term plans: • State Street Beacon expected to: – Deliver expense savings – Achieve digital vision while enhancing our profit margins • Review non-strategic, low return businesses and activities for potential exit • Expect to successfully manage regulatory pressure to moderate expense growth • Macro trends support long-term revenue growth Remain Committed to Long-term Growth Goals  

63 State Street Beacon expected to deliver financial benefits to be achieved through 2020 1 Estimated pre-tax expense savings improvement relate only to State Street Beacon and the targeted staff reductions announced as part of our 3Q15 financial results, and are based on projected improvement from our full-year 2015 operating-basis expenses, all else being equal. Actual expenses may increase or decrease in the future due to other factors. Pre-tax operating margin targets assume the successful completion of State Street Beacon milestones and an external environment that is consistent with our long term assumptions, including: Fed Funds and U.S. market interest rates increase from December 31, 2015 levels by at least 100bps by the beginning of 2018; and regulatory expense growth moderates. Other factors may also effect the actual results. 2 Operating-basis financial outlook is a non-GAAP presentation. Refer to the Appendix linked to this presentation for explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures. Expected Annual Pre-Tax Net Run-Rate Expense Savings • To achieve estimated annual pre-tax net run-rate expense savings of $550M by the end of 2020 for full effect in 20211: − Expect approximately $100M in annual pre-tax net run-rate expense savings in 20161 including targeted staff reductions announced in 3Q15 earnings call − Expect at least $125M in additional annual pre-tax net run-rate expense savings in 20171 • Annual pre-tax run-rate expense savings are net of significant investments in State Street Beacon commencing in 2016 Expected Profit Margins • To achieve and maintain a pre-tax operating margin2 of at least 31% by 2018 and 33% by the end of 2020, given our assumptions1, all else being equal Expected Pre-Tax Restructuring Charges • Estimated pre-tax non-operating restructuring charges of approximately $300M to $400M from 2016 through 2020 • Expect restructuring charges to be announced as State Street Beacon progresses, potentially beginning in 1Q16

M anagement believes that operating-basis financial information, which reports revenue from non-taxable sources, such as interest revenue from tax-exempt investment securities and processing fees and other revenue associated with tax-advantaged investments, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes the impact o f revenue and expenses outside of State Street's normal course of business, facilitates an investor's understanding and analysis of State Street's underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared and reported in conformity with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to , not as a substitute for or superior to , financial measures determined in conformity with GAAP.
