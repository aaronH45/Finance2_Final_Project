Downers Grove, Illinois, January 26, 2016 — Dover (NYSE: DOV) announced today that for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, revenue was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 14% from the prior year.

EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2015 included discrete tax benefits of $0.06, compared to $0.02 EPS in the prior year period. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $0.81, a decrease of 20% over an adjusted EPS of $1.01 in the prior year period. EPS for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 includes restructuring costs of $0.08 EPS and $0.16 EPS, respectively.

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $7.0 billion, a decrease of 10% over the prior year, reflecting an organic revenue decline of 10% and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of 4%, offset by 4% growth from acquisitions. Earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $595.9 million, a decrease of 23% as compared to $778.1 million for the prior year period. Diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $3.74, compared to $4.61 EPS in the prior year period, representing a decrease of 19%. EPS from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 included discrete tax benefits of $0.11, compared to $0.07 EPS in the prior year period. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS from continuing operations decreased 20% to $3.63 from an adjusted EPS of $4.54 in the prior year period. EPS for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 includes restructuring costs of $0.25 EPS and $0.19 EPS, respectively. 

Robert A. Livingston, Dover's President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Fourth quarter and full year results continued to be impacted by tough business conditions, particularly in oil & gas markets. In this environment, we delivered fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.81, driven by solid execution, as our teams continued to pursue customer wins, cost actions and productivity initiatives. 

“During 2015, we increased our efforts around operating efficiencies through our Dover Excellence program. One key element of this program focuses on free cash flow generation, which increased to $795 million for the year. This program also supports our ongoing investment in product innovation and customer expansion activities. Additionally, during the year we took multiple steps to right-size our businesses to reflect difficult market conditions, especially in our Energy segment. These initiatives will remain a focus as we move into 2016. 

“Regarding 2016, we are reaffirming EPS to be in the range of $3.85 to $4.05. This guidance reflects a lower revenue forecast driven by weaker oil & gas markets, essentially offset by an improved tax rate. In total, our full-year revenue growth, on an adjusted basis, is now anticipated to be in the range of 1% to 4%, comprising an organic revenue decline of (4%) to (1%), one point below our prior forecast. Acquisition growth of 7% and a 2% impact from FX remain unchanged from our prior forecast.”

Net earnings for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, were $141.8 million, or $0.91 EPS, which included earnings from discontinued operations of $5.3 million, compared to net earnings of $169.3 million, or $1.02 EPS, for the same period of 2014, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $2.5 million, or $0.02 EPS. 

Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $869.8 million, or $5.46 EPS, which included earnings from discontinued operations of $273.9 million, or $1.72 EPS, compared to net earnings of $775.2 million, or $4.59 EPS, for the same period of 2014, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $2.9 million, or $0.02 EPS. 2015 earnings from discontinued operations included gains of $265.6 million, or $1.67 EPS, resulting from the disposition of two businesses held for sale.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2015

Acquisitions

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company completed three acquisitions across the Fluids segment and the Printing & Identification platform of the Engineered Systems segment. For the full year 2015, Dover made a total of four acquisitions for consideration totaling $567.8 million. 

Discontinued Operations

For the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recognized a gain from discontinued operations of $5.3 million, or $0.03 EPS. On a full-year basis, the Company generated net earnings of $273.9 million, or $1.72 EPS. Included in this amount is a $87.8 million gain on sale of Datamax O'Neil, which was sold in the first quarter of 2015 and a $177.8 million gain on sale of Sargent Aerospace, which was sold in the second quarter of 2015. Also included in the results of discontinued operations is $6.3 million of earnings, or $0.04 EPS, attributable to the operations of Datamax O'Neil and Sargent Aerospace. 

Restructuring and Other Costs

During the quarter, the Company took actions to adjust our costs and streamline our businesses, resulting in $16.5 million, or $0.08 EPS, of restructuring charges. These charges were incurred primarily at each of our business segments, including $4.2 million in Energy, $4.5 million in Engineered Systems, $1.3 million in Fluids, and $6.3 million in Refrigeration & Food Equipment. For full year, restructuring costs totaled $55.2 million, or $0.25 EPS, of which primarily $30.8 million was incurred in Energy, $13.3 million in Engineered Systems, $4.9 million in Fluids, and $5.8 million in Refrigeration and Food Equipment. 

Tax Rate

The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 19.4% and 25.6% for the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. On a full year basis, the effective tax rates on continuing operations for 2015 and 2014 were 25.6% and 28.9%, respectively. The 2015 and 2014 rates were favorably impacted by discrete and other items, as shown in the reconciliation for quarterly earnings per share included herein. After adjusting for discrete and other items, the fourth quarter effective tax rates were 25.0% and 27.3% for 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the full year rates were 27.8% and 29.9% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate year over year is principally due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings as well as restructuring of foreign operations. 

Free Cash Flow

The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) from cash flow provided by operating activities: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The fourth quarter 2015 decrease in free cash flow reflects lower earnings relative to the prior year driven by lower volume and product mix.

Revenue Growth Factors

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Includes a decline in revenue in Q4 within the Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment due to the divestiture of a product line. 

Share Repurchases

In January 2015, the Board of Directors approved a new standing share repurchase authorization, whereby the Company may repurchase up to 15 million shares of its common stock over the following three years. This plan replaced the Company's $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which it completed in 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company purchased a total of approximately 8.2 million shares of its common stock in the open market at a total cost of $600.2 million, or $72.94 per share. As of December 31, 2015, the approximate number of shares still available for repurchase under the January 2015 share repurchase authorization was 6.8 million. 

Capitalization 

The following table provides a summary reconciliation of total debt and net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-GAAP Information: 

These Investor Supplement tables contain non-GAAP measures of adjusted earnings from continuing operations used in calculating adjusted diluted earnings per common share, as management believes this information is useful to investors to better understand the company’s ongoing profitability and facilitates easier comparisons of the company’s profitability to prior and future periods and to its peers. The company has also disclosed herein a number of non-GAAP measures related to free cash flow and the ratio of net debt to net capitalization. Management believes these metrics are important measures of the company's operating performance and liquidity. Free cash flow information provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase common stock, while the net debt to net capitalization ratio is helpful in evaluating the company's capital structure and the amount of leverage employed.
