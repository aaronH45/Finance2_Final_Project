   •   Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairment Charges: During the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we determined that circumstances indicated it had become more likely than not that the non-cash goodwill and an indefinite-lived intangible asset of certain HealthCare Partners reporting units had become impaired. These circumstances included underperformance of the business in recent quarters, as well as changes in other market conditions, including government reimbursement cuts and our expected ability to mitigate them. We are performing the required valuation of certain HCP reporting units and have estimated the fair value of their net assets and implied goodwill with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm. Based on the current assessments, we recorded an estimated $206 million in non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of certain HCP reporting units. The final amount of these impairment charges will depend upon the final outcome of this valuation work, which we expect will be completed in the first quarter of 2016.  

   •   Adjusted Diluted Net Income Per Share: Adjusted net income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, excluding the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, net of tax, and certain other additional non-GAAP measures, was $239 million and adjusted diluted net income per share was $1.12. Adjusted net income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2015, excluding the amortization of intangible assets and certain other additional non-GAAP measures was $930 million, and adjusted diluted net income per share was $4.30.  

Adjusted net income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, excluding the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, net of tax, was $236 million, and adjusted diluted net income per share was $1.09. Adjusted net income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2014, excluding the amortization of intangible assets and additional certain other non-GAAP measures was $896 million, and adjusted diluted net income per share was $4.13.  

See schedules of reconciliations of non-GAAP measures.  

   •   Volume: Total U.S. dialysis treatments for the fourth quarter of 2015 were 6,649,227, or 84,061 treatments per day, representing a per day increase of 3.2% over the fourth quarter of 2014. Normalized non-acquired treatment growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 was 3.7%.  

The number of member months for which HCP provided care during the fourth quarter of 2015 was approximately 2.4 million, of which 0.9 million, 1.1 million and 0.4 million related to Medicare, commercial and Medicaid members, respectively.  

   •   Effective Tax Rate: Our effective tax rate was 76.4% and 40.9% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. was 105.7% and 52.2% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. This effective tax rate is impacted by non-deductible non-cash goodwill impairment charges, the non-deductible portion of the estimated pharmacy accrual, as well as the amount of third-party owners’ income attributable to non-tax paying entities.  

The adjusted effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, excluding estimated non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges and an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business, was 36.0%. In addition, the adjusted effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2015, further excluding a settlement charge related to the Vainer private civil suit, was 38.2%.  

We currently expect our 2016 effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. to be approximately 40.0% to 41.0%.  

   •   Center Activity: As of December 31, 2015, we provided dialysis services to a total of approximately 190,000 patients at 2,369 outpatient dialysis centers, of which 2,251 centers are located in the United States and 118 centers are located in ten countries outside of the United States. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we opened a total of 26 new dialysis centers and sold one dialysis center in the United States. We also acquired 14 dialysis centers and opened one new dialysis center outside of the United States.  

   •   Share Repurchases: During the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased a total of 2,156,951 shares of our common stock for $151 million, or an average price of $69.86 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 7,779,958 shares of our common stock for $575 million, at an average price of $73.96 per share.  

In addition, we also repurchased 3,689,738 shares of our common stock for $249 million, at an average price of $67.61 per share, during January 2016. As a result of these transactions we now have approximately $259 million remaining under our current board authorization for share repurchases.

This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements related to our guidance and expectations for our 2016 consolidated operating income, our 2016 Kidney Care operating income, HCP’s 2016 operating income, our 2016 consolidated operating cash flows, our 2016 effective tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. and our estimated charges and accruals and anticipated timing of the completion of the valuation of certain HCP reporting units. Factors that could impact future results include the uncertainties associated with the risk factors set forth in our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, our subsequent quarterly and annual reports, and our current reports on Form 8-K. The forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these risks and uncertainties.  

These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of those risk factors in our SEC filings relating to:  

   •   the concentration of profits generated by higher-paying commercial payor plans for which there is continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates, and a reduction in the number of patients under such plans, which may result in the loss of revenues or patients,  

   •   a reduction in government payment rates under the Medicare End Stage Renal Disease program or other government-based programs,  

   •   the impact of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 2015 Medicare Advantage benchmark structure,  

   •   risks arising from potential federal and/or state legislation that could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability,  

   •   changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies, or pharmaceutical pricing,  

   •   legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and including compliance with the provisions of our current corporate integrity agreement and current or potential investigations by various government entities and related government or private-party proceedings, and restrictions on our business and operations required by our corporate integrity agreement and other settlement terms, and the financial impact thereof,  

   •   continued increased competition from large- and medium-sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us,  

   •   our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, changing affiliation models for physicians, and the emergence of new models of care introduced by the government or private sector, that may erode our patient base and reimbursement rates, such as accountable care organizations, independent practice associations and integrated delivery systems, or to businesses outside of dialysis and HCP business,  

   •   our ability to complete acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or to integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire or have acquired, including HCP, or to expand our operations and services to markets outside the United States,  

   •   the variability of our cash flows,  

   •   the risk that we might invest material amounts of capital and incur significant costs in connection with the growth and development of our international operations, yet we might not be able to operate them profitably anytime soon, if at all,  

   •   risks arising from the use of accounting estimates, judgments and interpretations in our financial statements,  

   •   risks of losing key HCP employees, potential disruption from the HCP transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships with customers, partners, associated physicians and physician groups, hospitals and others,  

   •   the risk that laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which HCP conducts its business,  

   •   the risk that the cost of providing services under HCP’s agreements may exceed our compensation,  

   •   the risk that reductions in reimbursement rates, including Medicare Advantage rates, and future regulations may negatively impact HCP’s business, revenue and profitability,  

   •   the risk that HCP may not be able to successfully establish a presence in new geographic regions or successfully address competitive threats that could reduce its profitability,  

   •   the risk that a disruption in HCP’s healthcare provider networks could have an adverse effect on HCP’s business operations and profitability,  

4  

   •   the risk that reductions in the quality ratings of health maintenance organization plan customers of HCP could have an adverse effect on HCP’s business, or  

   •   the risk that health plans that acquire health maintenance organizations may not be willing to contract with HCP or may be willing to contract only on less favorable terms.  

We base our forward-looking statements on information currently available to us at the time of this release, and except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise.  

This release contains non-GAAP financial measures. For reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the attached reconciliation schedules. For the reasons stated in the reconciliation schedules, we believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information for investors.

 (1) These are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, and for a definition of adjusted amounts, see attached reconciliation schedules.  

 (2) Consolidated percentages of revenues are comprised of the dialysis and related lab services business, HCP’s business and other ancillary services and strategic initiatives. General and administrative expenses includes certain corporate support, long-term incentive compensation, as well as the estimated pharmacy accrual.  

 (3) The reported balance sheet amounts at December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, excludes $96.0 million, $100.0 million and $100.9 million, respectively, of a debt discount associated with our Term Loan B and other deferred financing costs.  

 (4) The Term Loan B is subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. Because actual LIBOR, for all periods presented above, was lower than this embedded LIBOR floor, the interest rate on the Term Loan B is set at its respective floor. At such time as the actual LIBOR-based variable component of our interest rate exceeds 0.75% on the Term Loan B, we will then be subject to LIBOR-based interest rate volatility on the LIBOR variable component of our interest rate on all of the Term Loan B. However, we are limited to a maximum rate of 2.50% on $2.75 billion of outstanding principal debt on the Term Loan B as a result of interest rate cap agreements. The remaining $713 million outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan B is subject to LIBOR-based interest rate volatility above a floor of 0.75%.

Note 1: Calculation of the Leverage Ratio  

Under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (Credit Agreement), the leverage ratio is defined as all funded debt plus the face amount of all letters of credit issued, minus cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments, divided by “Consolidated EBITDA”. The leverage ratio determines the interest rate margin payable by the Company for its Term Loan A and revolving line of credit under the Credit Agreement by establishing the margin over the base interest rate (LIBOR) that is applicable. The following leverage ratio was calculated using “Consolidated EBITDA” as defined in the Credit Agreement. The calculation below is based on the last twelve months of “Consolidated EBITDA”, pro forma for routine acquisitions that occurred during the period. The Company’s management believes the presentation of “Consolidated EBITDA” is useful to investors to enhance their understanding of the Company’s leverage ratio under its Credit Agreement.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In accordance with the Credit Agreement, the Company’s leverage ratio cannot exceed 5.00 to 1.00 as of December 31, 2015. At that date the Company’s leverage ratio did not exceed 5.00 to 1.00.

(dollars in thousands except for per share data)  

1. Adjusted net income and diluted net income per share attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. excluding estimated non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, an estimated pharmacy accrual, debt redemption and refinancing charges, a loss contingency accrual and a settlement charge, net of related tax.  

We believe that adjusted net income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. excluding estimated non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business, debt redemption and refinancing charges, a loss contingency accrual and settlement charge, net of related tax, enhances a user’s understanding of our normal net income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. and adjusted diluted net income per share attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. for these periods by providing a measure that is meaningful because it excludes unusual amounts related to estimated non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, primarily related to certain HCP reporting units, an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business, the debt redemption charges that resulted from the redemption of the $775 million 6  5⁄8% Senior Notes due 2020, debt refinancing charges that resulted from the refinancing of our Secured Credit Facilities, the redemption of the $775 million 6  3⁄8% Senior Notes due 2018, as well as the termination of certain interest rate swap agreements, a loss contingency accrual related to the 2010 and 2011 U.S. Attorney physician relationship investigations, and a settlement charge related to the Vainer private civil suit, net of related tax, and accordingly, is comparable to prior periods and indicative of normal net income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. and diluted net income per share attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. These measures are not measures of financial performance under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. and diluted net income per share attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc.

In addition, we have excluded amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions from our adjusted net income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. and from our adjusted diluted net income per share attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. as we believe this presentation enhances a user’s understanding of our operating results for these periods by providing a different reflection of the Company’s operating performance since it excludes the amortization of intangible assets that relate to the fair value measurement of acquired intangible assets associated with our acquisitions, and accordingly is indicative of consistent adjusted net income excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. and diluted net income per share attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. These measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. and diluted net income per share attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc.

2. Adjusted operating income excluding estimated non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, an estimated pharmacy accrual, a loss contingency accrual and a settlement charge.  

We believe that adjusted operating income excluding estimated non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business, a loss contingency accrual and a settlement charge enhances a user’s understanding of our normal operating income for these periods by providing a measure that is meaningful because it excludes unusual amounts related to estimated non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges primarily related to certain HCP reporting units, an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business, a loss contingency accrual related to the 2010 and 2011 U.S. Attorney physician relationship investigations, as well as a settlement charge related to the Vainer private civil suit and accordingly, are comparable to prior periods and indicative of consistent operating income. We have also presented adjusted operating income by reportable segment excluding a settlement charge related to the Vainer private civil suit, a loss contingency accrual related to the 2010 and 2011 U.S. Attorney physician relationship investigations, and estimated non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges. In addition, we have also presented adjusted operating income of the Kidney Care division excluding the settlement charge, a goodwill impairment charge and the pharmacy accrual. We believe these measures enhance a user’s understanding of our normal operating income by reportable segment for these periods by providing a measure that is meaningful because it excludes unusual amounts related to the settlement charge, a loss contingency accrual, and the non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, primarily related to certain HCP reporting units. These measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income.

3. Effective income tax rates and adjusted effective income tax rates.  

We believe that reporting the effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. as well as the adjusted effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc., excluding estimated non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business, and a settlement charge related to the Vainer suit, enhances an investor’s understanding of DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc.’s effective income tax rate and DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc.’s adjusted effective income tax rate for the periods presented because it excludes noncontrolling owners’ income that primarily relates to non-tax paying entities and unusual amounts that include estimated non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges primarily related to certain HCP reporting units, an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business and a settlement charge related to the Vainer suit, and, therefore, are meaningful to an investor to fully understand the related income tax effects on DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc.’s operating results. These are not measures under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the effective income tax rate calculated in accordance with GAAP.  

Effective income tax rate as compared to the effective income tax rate attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. is as follows:

4. Free cash flow and adjusted operating cash flow.  

Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less distributions to noncontrolling interests and capital expenditures for routine maintenance and information technology. We believe free cash flow is a useful adjunct to cash flow from operating activities and other measurements under GAAP, since free cash flow is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions and development activities and meet our debt service requirements. In addition, free cash flow excluding distributions to noncontrolling interests provides an investor with an understanding of free cash flows that are attributable to DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. We have also presented adjusted operating cash flow excluding the payments made in the second quarter of 2015 related to the settlement of the Vainer suit and in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the settlement of the 2010 and 2011 U.S. Attorney physician relationship investigations, net of tax, in each case. We believe this measure is meaningful to investors to understand our operating cash flows that were generated excluding these unusual payments that were part of the settlements. Free cash flow and adjusted operating cash flow are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity.

5. Total care dollars under management.  

In California, as a result of our managed care administrative services agreements with hospitals and health plans, HCP does not assume the direct financial risk for institutional (hospital) services in most cases, but is responsible for managing the care dollars associated with both the professional (physician) and institutional services being provided for the Per Member Per Month (PMPM) fee attributable to both professional and institutional services. In cases where HCP does not assume the direct financial risk, HCP recognizes the surplus of institutional revenue less institutional expense as HCP net revenue. In addition to revenues recognized for financial reporting purposes, HCP measures its total care dollars under management, which includes the PMPM fee payable to third parties for institutional services where HCP manages the care provided to its members by the hospitals and other institutions, which are not included in GAAP revenues. HCP uses total care dollars under management as a supplement to GAAP revenues as it allows HCP to measure profit margins on a comparable basis across both the global capitation model (where HCP assumes the full financial risk for all services, including institutional services) and the risk sharing models (where HCP operates under managed care administrative services agreements where HCP does not assume the full risk). HCP believes that presenting amounts in this manner is useful because it presents its operations on a unified basis without the complication caused by models that HCP has adopted in its California market as a result of various regulations related to the assumption of institutional risk. Total care dollars under management is not a measure of financial performance computed in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenues calculated in accordance with GAAP. Total care dollars under management includes PMPM payments received from third parties that are recorded net of expenses in our accounting records. The following table reconciles total care dollars under management to medical revenues for the periods indicated.
