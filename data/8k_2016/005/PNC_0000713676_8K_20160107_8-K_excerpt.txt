(d) On January 7, 2016, the board of directors (the “Board”) of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) increased the number of directors from 14 to 16 and appointed Daniel R. Hesse, the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Sprint Corp., and Michael J. Ward, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CSX Corporation, to serve on the Board effective immediately. With these appointments, PNC is continuing the evolution of its Board and preparing for the anticipated April retirement of three long serving directors. Mr. Hesse and Mr. Ward were also appointed as directors of PNC Bank, National Association. The Board determined that each of Mr. Hesse and Mr. Ward is independent under the director independence standards established by the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Hesse and Mr. Ward will receive compensation in accordance with PNC’s non-employee director compensation program described in PNC’s 2015 Proxy Statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 17, 2015.  

CSX Corporation has a variety of ordinary course credit relationships with PNC Bank, National Association. These lending relationships were entered in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rate and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with other customers and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.  

Mr. Hesse was appointed to the Risk Committee and the Technology Subcommittee of the Risk Committee. Mr. Ward was appointed to the Personnel and Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee.
