FOURTH QUARTER PRODUCT AND PIPELINE UPDATE

Global revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to fourth quarter 2014, were driven by Opdivo, which grew by $470 million; Eliquis, which grew by $321 million; Daklinza and Sunvepra, which grew by $251 million, Orencia, which grew 22%; and Sprycel, which grew 8%.

Opdivo

•In January, the company announced that a randomized Phase 3 study evaluating Opdivo versus investigator’s choice in patients with recurrent or metastatic platinum-refractory squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (CheckMate -141) was stopped early because an assessment conducted by the independent Data Monitoring Committee concluded that the study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating superior overall survival (OS) in patients receiving Opdivo compared to the control arm. The company looks forward to sharing these data with health authorities soon.

•In December, the company and its partner Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., announced that Ono received manufacturing and marketing approval for Opdivo in Japan for the treatment of patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.

•In November, the company announced the FDA approved Opdivo injection, for intravenous use, for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. Opdivo is the first and only PD-1 inhibitor to deliver significant OS in patients with advanced RCC who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. The approval, which was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA, was based on data from CheckMate -025, an open-label, randomized Phase 3 study evaluating Opdivo versus everolimus in patients with advanced RCC who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•In November, the company announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) validated a type II variation application which seeks to extend the current indication for Opdivo to include the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC after prior therapy. Validation of the application confirms the submission is complete and begins the EMA’s centralized review process. The type II variation submitted is based on data from CheckMate -025, a Phase 3 study that evaluated, as the primary endpoint, the OS of Opdivo versus everolimus, a current standard of care, in advanced or metastatic clear-cell RCC after prior anti-angiogenic treatment. 

•In November, the company announced results from multiple clinical trials at the Society for Melanoma Research 2015 International Congress in San Francisco, California.

Yervoy

•In October, the company announced the FDA approved Yervoy 10 mg/kg for the adjuvant treatment of patients with cutaneous melanoma with pathologic involvement of regional lymph nodes of more than 1 mm who have undergone complete resection including total lymphadenectomy. The approval is based on clinical data from a pivotal Phase 3 trial, CA184-029 (EORTC 18071), initiated in 2008 by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer evaluating the 10 mg/kg dose in the adjuvant setting.

Empliciti

•In November, the company and its partner AbbVie, Inc. announced the FDA approved Empliciti for the treatment of multiple myeloma as combination therapy with Revlimid® and dexamethasone in patients who have received one to three prior therapies. The approval of this first and only immunostimulatory antibody for multiple myeloma is based on data from the randomized, open-label, Phase 3, ELOQUENT-2 study, which demonstrated the combination of Empliciti with Revlimid and dexamethasone delivered a 30% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to dexamethasone alone.

Daklinza

•In November, the company announced results from the Phase 3 ALLY-3+ trial investigating a regimen of Daklinza in combination with sofosbuvir and ribavirin in genotype 3 hepatitis C patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, for treatment durations of 12 and 16 weeks. The results show that 100% of patients in the advanced fibrosis cohort achieved sustained virologic response (SVR12) in both the 12- and 16-week arms of the study. SVR12 rates were 83% and 89% in patients with cirrhosis in the 12- and 16-week arms, respectively. The combination regimen had no discontinuations due to adverse events and relapse occurred in four patients (two in the 16-week and two in the 12-week arm). There was one death (12-week arm; not treatment-related) and no virologic breakthroughs. Results were presented at The Liver Meeting 2015, the annual meeting of The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases in San Francisco, California.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT UPDATE

•In December, the company announced it has entered into agreements with ViiV Healthcare, a global HIV company, to divest its pipeline of investigational HIV medicines including an attachment inhibitor (BMS-663068), currently being investigated in Phase 3 as a therapeutic option for heavily treatment-experienced patients, and a maturation inhibitor (BMS-955176) currently being investigated in Phase 2b development for treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients. These transactions are consistent with the evolution of the company’s strategic focus, including the decision announced in June to discontinue its discovery efforts in virology. 

6

•In December, the company announced a new research collaboration with the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University that includes the establishment of the Center for Molecular Synthesis (BMS-CMS). The agreement creates opportunities for scientists at Princeton University and the company to collaborate on top-flight synthetic chemistry research, leveraging the two sites’ close proximity to foster a robust exchange of scientific ideas. Research projects will investigate areas of mutual interest and benefit, using the expertise developed in the laboratories of the Princeton faculty to conduct frontier science within the pharmaceutical industry. Over the next five years, the Center will also fund a select group of research fellows each year.

•In November, the company announced a definitive agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Cardioxyl Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a private biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The company completed the acquisition in December. The acquisition gives the company full rights to Cardioxyl’s lead asset CXL-1427, a novel nitroxyl (HNO) donor (prodrug) in Phase 2 clinical development as an intravenous treatment for acute decompensated heart failure. 

•In November, the company completed a previously announced agreement with Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. for an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of Five Prime’s colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) antibody program, including FPA008, which is in Phase 1 development for immunology and oncology indications.

•The company announced several collaborations as part of the Immuno-Oncology Rare Population Malignancy (I-O RPM) program in the U.S.: 

◦In December, the company announced an agreement with the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA to conduct a range of early phase clinical studies. The company will fund positions within UCLA’s fellowship program in the UCLA Division of Hematology/Oncology.

◦In December, the company announced an agreement with The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center - Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute to conduct a range of early phase clinical studies. The company will fund training positions within the Hematology and Medical Oncology fellowship programs of the Ohio State University College of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine.

◦In November, the company announced an agreement with The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins to conduct a range of early phase clinical studies. The company will also fund positions within The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine fellowship program.
