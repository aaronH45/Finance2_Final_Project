   Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.    

  On January 19, 2016, U.S. Bancorp announced the promotion of Andrew Cecere, 55, to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer of U.S. Bancorp and U.S. Bank National Association ("U.S. Bank"), its principal banking subsidiary, effective as of January 18, 2016. Mr. Cecere had been serving as Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of U.S. Bancorp and U.S. Bank. Mr. Cecere will continue to report to Richard K. Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of U.S. Bancorp and U.S. Bank. Mr. Davis had also been serving as President. 

In connection with his promotion, Mr. Cecere will receive an increase in his base salary to an annualized base salary of $800,000. Mr. Cecere will be eligible to receive an annual cash incentive award with a target value of 150% of his base salary. Mr. Cecere will receive his annual long-term equity award, valued at $5,775,000 as of the grant date of February 18, 2016, which will be granted 75% in the form of performance-based restricted stock units and 25% in the form of nonqualified stock options. Additional information about U.S. Bancorp’s executive compensation program can be found in its 2015 proxy statement.

During 2015, U.S. Bancorp and its banking and investment subsidiaries engaged in transactions in the ordinary course of business with Mr. Cecere and certain of his family members, and the entities with which they are associated. All loans and loan commitments and any transactions involving other financial products and services in connection with these transactions were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including current interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with others not related to U.S. Bancorp’s banking and investment subsidiaries and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features.

During 2015, U.S. Bank also paid Little & Co., a design and branding agency, approximately $2.8 million in professional fees for brand strategy and design work. The President of Little & Co. is the brother of Mr. Cecere. The selection of Little & Co. was made based on U.S. Bank’s regular sourcing and competitive bidding process, without the involvement of Mr. Cecere. The fees paid to Little & Co. were negotiated on an arm’s length basis and were not material to U.S. Bank’s 2015 marketing and advertising expense. The branding work will conclude in 2016, and U.S. Bank does not intend to continue the engagement or to have Little & Co. bid for future work, in order to avoid the appearance of any conflict of interest with Mr. Cecere.

A copy of the press release issued by the Company on January 19, 2016, announcing the promotion of Mr. Cecere is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
