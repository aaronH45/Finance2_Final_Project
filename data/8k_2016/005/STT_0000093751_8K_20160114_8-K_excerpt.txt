On January 14, 2016, State Street Bank and Trust Company, State Street Corporation’s principal banking subsidiary, announced a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve the issues involved in the investigation we had previously disclosed relating to our solicitation of asset servicing business for public retirement plans. In reaching this settlement, we have not admitted or denied the findings or conduct described in the SEC’s order. The conduct described in the SEC’s order relates to actions of a former employee, and consultants that he retained on our behalf, in connection with contract solicitations in Ohio in 2010, and the order includes a finding of violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Under the terms of the settlement, we have agreed to pay an aggregate of $12 million in disgorgement and penalty. These settlement amounts will be recorded in our results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015.
