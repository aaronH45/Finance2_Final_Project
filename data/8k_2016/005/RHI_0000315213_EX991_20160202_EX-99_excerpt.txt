ROBERT HALF REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER AND YEAR-END FINANCIAL RESULTS

Annual Earnings Per Share at All-Time High

MENLO PARK, Calif., February 2, 2016 — Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE symbol: RHI) today reported revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2015. 

For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, net income was $93 million, or $.71 per share, on revenues of $1.30 billion. Net income for the prior year’s fourth quarter was $84 million, or $.62 per share, on revenues of $1.22 billion.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, net income was $358 million, or $2.69 per share, on revenues of $5.09 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2014, net income was $306 million, or $2.26 per share, on revenues of $4.70 billion. 

Harold M. Messmer, Jr., chairman and CEO of Robert Half, said, “Demand for our professional staffing and consulting services remained strong in the fourth quarter, fueled by a healthy U.S. job market and low unemployment in numerous professional occupations, as well as a more positive economic backdrop in many of our non-U.S. markets. We saw year-over-year revenue growth across the board in our staffing and consulting operations, both in the United States and abroad.” 

Messmer added, “This was the company’s 23rd straight quarter of double-digit net income and earnings-per-share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Unlevered return on equity was 37 percent.”

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The financial results of Robert Half International Inc. (the “Company”) are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). To help readers understand the Company’s financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with revenue growth rates derived from non-GAAP revenue amounts.

Variations in the Company’s financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and billing days. The Company provides “same billing days and constant currency” revenue growth calculations to remove the impact of these items. These calculations show the year-over-year revenue growth rates for the Company’s lines of business on both a reported basis and also on a same-day, constant-currency basis for global, U.S. and international operations. This information is presented for each of the six most recent quarters. The Company has provided this data because management believes it better reflects the Company’s actual revenue growth rates and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time. The Company expresses year-over-year revenue changes as calculated percentages using the same number of billing days and constant currency exchange rates.

The non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to actual revenue growth derived from revenue amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided on the following pages.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

REVENUE GROWTH RATES (%) (UNAUDITED):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The non-GAAP financial measures included in the table above adjust for the following items:

Foreign Currency Translation. The “As Reported” revenue growth rates are based upon reported revenues, which include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to calculate “Constant Currency” revenue growth rates, as-reported amounts are retranslated using foreign exchange rates from the prior year’s comparable period.

Billing Days. The “As Reported” revenue growth rates are based upon reported revenues. Management calculates a global, weighted-average number of billing days for each reporting period based upon input from all countries and all lines of business. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billing days, the company calculates “same billing day” revenue growth rates by dividing each comparative period’s reported revenues by the calculated number of billing days for that period, to arrive at a “per billing day” amount. The “same billing day” growth rates are then calculated based upon the “per billing day” amounts.

The term “same billing days and constant currency” means that the impact of different billing days has been removed from constant currency calculation. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP year-over-year revenue growth rates to the “As Reported” year-over-year revenue growth rates is included herein on Pages 8-10.
