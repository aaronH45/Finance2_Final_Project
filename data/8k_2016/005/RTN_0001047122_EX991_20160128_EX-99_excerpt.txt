“Raytheon delivered solid operating performance and returned to growth in 2015. Strong bookings during the year from our global customers position us well for continued growth in 2016,” said Thomas A. Kennedy, Raytheon Chairman and CEO. “As we look ahead, we remain focused on creating value for our shareholders and customers by delivering strong program execution, while also investing in our future and pursuing a balanced capital deployment strategy.”

The Company generated strong operating cash flow for both the fourth quarter and full-year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2015 was $813 million compared to $829 million for the fourth quarter 2014.

Effective January 1, 2016, the Company reclassified, for all business segments, acquisition accounting adjustments related to the amortization of acquired intangibles and adjustments to record acquired deferred revenue at fair value, such that they will no longer be reported within the business segments and will instead be reported in separate deferred revenue adjustment and amortization of intangibles line items. The 2015 deferred revenue adjustment and amortization of acquired intangibles in the table below have been recast to reflect this change.

Segment Results

The Company's reportable segments are: Integrated Defense Systems (IDS); Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS); Missile Systems (MS); Space and Airborne Systems (SAS); and Forcepoint.

Effective January 1, 2016, in order to gain additional efficiencies, the Company reorganized the IDS and IIS business segments to move certain air traffic systems, border and critical infrastructure protection and highway tolling programs from IDS to IIS.

The pro-forma attachments at the end of this release present prior period segment data recasted to reflect these changes and the acquisition accounting adjustments changes discussed above.

Missile Systems (MS) had fourth quarter 2015 net sales of $1,879 million, up 9 percent compared to $1,719 million in the fourth quarter 2014.

MS recorded $258 million of operating income in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to $212 million in the fourth quarter 2014.
