ALLIANT ENERGY ANNOUNCES 2015 RESULTS

Affirms 2016 earnings guidance, updates forecasted 2016-2019 capital expenditures

MADISON, Wis. - February 22, 2016 - Alliant Energy Corporation (NYSE: LNT) today announced U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP consolidated unaudited earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for 2015 and 2014 as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

“In 2015, we once again delivered solid financial and operational results,” said Patricia Kampling, Alliant Energy Chairman, President and CEO. “Consistent with our long-term earnings growth goal, our temperature normalized non-GAAP earnings per share increased by 5% over calendar year 2014. We will continue to balance operational and financial discipline, cost impact to customers and capital investments while striving to achieve our projected earnings growth rate of 5-7%.”

Utilities, ATC and Corporate Services - Alliant Energy’s Utilities, American Transmission Company LLC (ATC) and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. (Corporate Services) operations generated $3.43 per share of non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations in 2015, which was $0.08 per share higher than 2014. The primary drivers of higher EPS were lower retail electric customer billing credits in 2015 and Duane Arnold Energy Center (DAEC) purchase power capacity charges at Interstate Power and Light Company (IPL) in 2014, and lower energy efficiency cost recovery amortizations at Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WPL). Higher year-over-year EPS was partially offset by higher electric transmission service expense at WPL, lower sales due to milder temperatures, and higher depreciation, interest expense, and employee benefits-related expense.

Non-regulated and Parent - Alliant Energy’s Non-regulated and Parent operations generated $0.06 per share of non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations in 2015, which was $0.07 per share lower than 2014. The primary driver of lower EPS was lower transportation earnings.

Earnings Adjustments - Non-GAAP EPS for 2015 excludes $0.07 per share of losses on sales of IPL’s Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets and $0.04 per share of voluntary employee separation charges. Non-GAAP adjustments, which relate to material charges or income that are not normally associated with ongoing operations, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP.

Temperature Normalized Non-GAAP EPS - Alliant Energy’s estimate of temperature normalized non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations for fiscal year 2015 is $3.57. This estimate is calculated by adding $0.08 per share, which represents Alliant Energy’s estimate of the negative per share impact of temperatures in 2015 on electric and gas margins, to Alliant Energy’s non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $3.49, as shown in the table above. The comparable estimate of Alliant Energy’s temperature normalized non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations for fiscal year 2014 is $3.39 per share. The 2014 estimate is calculated by subtracting $0.09 per share, which represents Alliant Energy’s estimate of the positive per share impact of temperatures in 2014 on electric and gas margins, from Alliant Energy’s non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $3.48, as shown in the table above.

Details regarding GAAP EPS from continuing operations variances between 2015 and 2014 for Alliant Energy are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Lower retail electric customer billing credits at IPL - IPL is providing customer billing credits to its Iowa retail electric customers of $105 million in aggregate over the 2014-2016 period in connection with its approved Iowa retail electric base rate freeze through 2016. In 2015, IPL credited customer bills by $24 million. By comparison, the billing credits in 2014 only occurred from May through December and were $72 million.

Higher electric transmission service expense at WPL - Included in WPL’s base rate settlement for 2015 and 2016 was an increase in transmission expenses primarily due to the anticipated allocation of system support resource costs from the Presque Isle plant located in upper Michigan. Subsequent to the settlement, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued an order requiring the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. to change how it allocates those system support resource costs. As a result, the amount of transmission expenses billed to WPL in 2015 was lower than what was reflected in the settlement. WPL’s 2015 income statement reflects transmission expenses based on what was reflected in the base rate settlement. Since the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) approved escrow accounting treatment of transmission expenses, the difference between actual transmission expenses billed to WPL and those reflected in the settlement will accumulate in a regulatory liability and be refunded to customers in the future.

Losses on sale of Minnesota electric and gas distribution assets in 2015 at IPL - In 2015, IPL completed the sales of its Minnesota gas and electric distribution assets and received aggregate proceeds of approximately $140 million and a $2 million promissory note. The premium received over the book value of the property, plant and equipment sold was more than offset by tax-related regulatory assets associated with the Minnesota distribution assets, resulting in a $0.07 per share non-recurring charge recorded in 2015.

Voluntary employee separation charges - With Alliant Energy’s continued focus to keep costs manageable for its customers, it is reshaping the organization to be leaner. Approximately 2% of total Alliant Energy employees accepted voluntary separation packages, which resulted in charges of $0.04 per share recorded in 2015.
