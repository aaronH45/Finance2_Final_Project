        " due to growth in the investment portfolio. Total noninterest income decreased $36 million (12.0 percent) from the fourth quarter of last year, mainly due to the 2014 Nuveen gain, partially offset by the HSA deposit sale. Total noninterest expense decreased $104 million (29.3 percent), principally due to the notable items in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by higher compensation and employee benefits expense, reflecting higher pension costs, the impact of merit increases and staffing for risk and compliance activities. The provision for credit losses was $27 million lower year-over-year, primarily due to lower net charge-offs, along with a favorable change in the reserve allocation."
