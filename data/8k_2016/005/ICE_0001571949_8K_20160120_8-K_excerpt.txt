The Bylaws will become effective upon such approval. 

The Bylaws include a new Section 2.15 that permits a stockholder, or a group of up to twenty stockholders, owning at least three percent of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s annual meeting proxy materials director nominees constituting up to twenty percent of the number of directors currently serving on the Board, but no less than two, provided that the stockholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws. 

The Bylaws also include changes to the advance notice provisions in Section 2.13 to account for proxy access. 

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
