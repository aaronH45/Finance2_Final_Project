Item 8.01 Other Events. 

On December 21, 2015, the Delaware Chancery Court issued an opinion in In re VAALCO Energy, Inc. Stockholder Litigation, Consol. C.A. No. 11775-VCL, invalidating as a matter of law provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of VAALCO Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, that permitted the removal of VAALCO’s directors by its stockholders only for cause. The Chancery Court held that, in the absence of a classified board or cumulative voting, VAALCO’s “only for-cause” director removal provisions conflict with Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law and are therefore invalid. 

Clause 7 of Article SIXTH of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”) of Amphenol Corporation (the “Company”) contains a similar “only for-cause” director removal provision, and the Company does not have a classified board of directors or cumulative voting. In light of the VAALCO decision, the Company will not attempt to enforce such “only for-cause” director removal provision. 

On January 14, 2016, further as a result of the VAALCO decision, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted resolutions (the “Resolutions”) setting forth an amendment to the Company’s Charter (the “Proposed Amendment”) in order to provide that, consistent with Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed from office at any time, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. The Resolutions also declared the advisability of the Proposed Amendment and directed that the Proposed Amendment be considered at the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders.
