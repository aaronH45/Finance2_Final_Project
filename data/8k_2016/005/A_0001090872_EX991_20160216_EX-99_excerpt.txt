SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 16, 2016 - Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported revenue of $1.03 billion, flat year over year (up 6 percent on a core basis(3)) for the first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, 2016. 

First-quarter GAAP income from continuing operations was $123 million, or $0.37 per share. Last year’s first-quarter GAAP income from continuing operations was $93 million, or $0.28 per share. 

During the first quarter, Agilent had intangible amortization of $43 million, transformation costs of $11 million, acquisition and integration costs of $5 million, a pension curtailment gain of $16 million, and $6 million of other costs. Excluding those items, and a tax benefit of $19 million, Agilent reported first-quarter adjusted income from continuing operations of $153 million, $0.46 per share(1).

Agilent’s adjusted operating margin was 20.2%(4) for the first quarter, up 200 basis points over a year ago.

“Agilent delivered a strong start to the year,” said Mike McMullen, Agilent president and CEO. “Revenue and earnings per share exceeded our guidance range, reflecting the strength of Agilent’s products, services and relationships with customers in our markets.”

“We are building a business that can drive sustainable growth, expand operating margins and provide long-term value to our shareholders,” he added. 

First-quarter revenue of $526 million from Agilent’s Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group (LSAG) declined 4 percent year over year (up 2 percent on a core basis(3)). Robust growth in pharma was offset by softness in the applied markets. LSAG’s Q1 operating margin was 21.7 percent.

First-quarter revenue of $344 million from the Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) grew 4 percent year over year (up 10 percent on a core basis(3)). Both services and consumables continued to see solid growth worldwide. ACG’s operating margin was 22.1 percent for the quarter.

First-quarter revenue of $158 million from Agilent’s Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG) increased 7 percent year over year (up 12 percent on a core basis(3)), reflecting momentum across all of its businesses. DGG’s operating margin for the quarter was 9.6 percent.

Agilent expects second-quarter 2016 revenue in the range of $965 million to $985 million. Second-quarter non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.39 per share(2).

For fiscal year 2016, Agilent expects revenue of $4.10 billion to $4.12 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $1.81 to $1.87 per share(2). The guidance is based on Jan. 29, 2016, exchange rates.

(1)Non-GAAP income from continuing operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations per share exclude primarily the impacts of acquisition and integration costs, transformation initiatives, pension curtailment gain, business exit and divestiture costs, and non-cash intangibles amortization. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. A reconciliation between non-GAAP net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.

(2)Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q2 FY16 and full fiscal year 2016 excludes primarily the future impact of acquisition and integration costs, pension curtailment gain, business exit and divestiture costs and non-cash intangibles amortization. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $42 million per quarter.

(3)Core revenue excludes the impact of currency, the NMR business and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Core revenue is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation between GAAP revenue and core revenue is set forth on page 7 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.

(4)Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP measure and excludes primarily the impacts of acquisition and integration costs, transformation initiatives, pension curtailment gain, business exit and divestiture costs, and non-cash intangibles amortization in addition to the costs related to services Agilent is providing to Keysight post separation. A reconciliation is set forth on page 8 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) The adjustment for taxes excludes tax benefits that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. For the three months ended January 31, 2016 and 2015 , management uses a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20% for both periods, that we believe to be indicative of on-going operations.

Historical amounts are reclassified to conform with current presentation.

We provide non-GAAP income from continuing operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, pension curtailment, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs and business exit and divestiture costs. 

Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers, small site consolidations, reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. Included in this category are also expenses associated with the post-separation resizing of the IT infrastructure and streamlining of IT systems as well as the expenses incurred primarily in fiscal year 2015 to effect the Agile Agilent reengineering.

Acquisition and Integration costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs.

Business exit and divestiture costs include costs associated with the exit of the NMR business and the divestiture of the XRD business.

Pension curtailment gain resulted from certain retirement plans benefit reductions.

Other includes certain legal costs and settlements in addition to other miscellaneous adjustments.

Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.

Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance.

Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.
