Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On February 1, 2016, Wells Fargo & Company (the “Company”) reached an agreement in principle with the United States Department of Justice, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California, and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (collectively, the “Federal Government”) to pay $1.2 billion to resolve certain civil claims that the Federal Government had pending against the Company relating to the Company’s Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) lending program for the time period 2001-2010, as well as other potential civil claims relating to the Company’s FHA lending activities for other periods. 

In connection with the resolution of these matters, the Company, subsequent to the announcement of its 2015 financial results on January 15, 2016, has provided for an additional legal accrual which increased operating losses within noninterest expense by $200 million. As a result, the Company reduced its net income for the year ended December 31, 2015, by $134 million, or $0.03 per common share, to $22.9 billion, or $4.12 per common share.

Although the Company and the Federal Government have reached an agreement in principle to resolve these matters, there can be no assurance that the Company and the Federal Government will agree on the final documentation of the settlement.

The information provided under Item 2.02 of this Report shall be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
