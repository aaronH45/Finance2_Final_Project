Chubb Limited News Release  

Evan G. Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chubb Limited, commented: “For the fourth quarter, our last as ACE Limited, we produced very good operating results that capped an excellent year for the company both financially and strategically. After-tax operating income of $780 million in the quarter contributed to full-year earnings of $9.76 per share, essentially flat with last year’s record operating income and up 3.5% when adjusted for foreign exchange.  

“The year was highlighted by record underwriting results, 8% constant-dollar premium growth and an ROE of 11.5%. From a long-term strategic perspective, the year was historic and transformational. We completed the acquisition of the Fireman’s Fund U.S. high net worth personal lines business, launched ABR Re, and then announced the largest insurance transaction in history with the $29.5 billion acquisition of The Chubb Corporation, which we closed on January 14, 2016.  

“Our strong earnings were driven first and foremost by an exceptionally strong underwriting performance as illustrated by P&C combined ratios of 87.7% for the quarter and a record 87.4% for the year. At almost $2 billion, full-year P&C underwriting income was also a record. Full-year net investment income of $2.2 billion, down about 2.5%, stood up well, given foreign exchange rates and the low interest rate environment, and benefited from our strong cash flow of $3.9 billion.  

“Foreign exchange headwinds, which have affected all dollar-based multinationals, impacted our revenue, income and book value growth throughout the year. Global P&C net premiums, which exclude agriculture, were down 2% in the quarter but up 5% in constant currency, compared to full-year growth of 1% on a reported basis and nearly 8% adjusted for foreign exchange. Per share book value growth was essentially flat for the year but was up over 3% in constant dollars.  

“We are now the new Chubb, the largest publicly traded P&C insurer in the world. We’ve hit the ground running and are executing the thorough integration plans we established in the six months leading up to the close of the acquisition. The energy, morale and overall feeling of optimism are high throughout the ranks of the company. We are focused on knitting ourselves together as one and achieving the ambitious targets we have set and expect of ourselves and the value creation we will generate for the benefit of our customers, business partners, employees and shareholders.”

Regulation G – Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In presenting our results, we included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial condition. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  

Throughout this document there are various measures presented on a constant-dollar basis (i.e., excludes the impact of foreign exchange). We believe it is useful to evaluate the trends in our results, exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which our international business is transacted, as these exchange rates could fluctuate significantly between periods and distort the analysis of trends. The impact is determined by assuming constant foreign exchange rates between periods by translating prior period results using the same local currency exchange rates as the comparable current period.

Chubb Limited News Release  

Adjusted net realized gains (losses), net of tax, includes net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) recorded in other income (expense) related to unconsolidated subsidiaries, and excludes realized gains and losses on crop derivatives. These derivatives were purchased to provide economic benefit, in a manner similar to reinsurance protection, in the event that a significant decline in commodity pricing impacts underwriting results. We view gains and losses on these derivatives as part of the results of our underwriting operations, and therefore realized gains (losses) from these derivatives are reclassified to adjusted losses and loss expenses. The P&C combined ratio includes adjusted losses and loss expenses in the ratio numerator.  

Underwriting income, P&C underwriting income, and Global P&C underwriting income are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, policy benefits, policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. P&C underwriting income also includes gains (losses) on crop derivatives. We use underwriting income and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including net investment income, other income (expense), interest and income tax expense and adjusted net realized gains (losses). Current accident year underwriting income excluding catastrophe losses is underwriting income adjusted to exclude catastrophe losses and prior period development (PPD). We believe it is useful to exclude catastrophe losses, as they are not predictable as to timing and amount, and PPD as these unexpected loss developments on historical reserves are not indicative of our current underwriting performance. We believe the use of these measures enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business.  

Operating income or income excluding adjusted net realized gains (losses), net of tax is a common performance measurement for insurance companies. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude adjusted net realized gains (losses) because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by the availability of market opportunities. We also exclude Chubb integration and related expenses related to the acquisition due to the size, complexity, and volume of this acquisition, which may not be indicative of such future costs. We believe that excluding the Chubb integration and related expenses facilitates the comparison of our financial results to our historical operating results. These costs include legal and professional fees and all costs directly related to the integration activities of the Chubb acquisition including pre-acquisition interest expense on the $5.3 billion senior notes issued in November 2015. Operating income or income excluding adjusted net realized gains (losses) should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, we disclose operating income excluding the impact of foreign exchange in order to adjust for the distortive effects of fluctuations in exchange rates.  

P&C combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and PPD and current accident year P&C combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses exclude impacts of catastrophe losses and PPD. We believe this measure provides a better evaluation of our core underwriting performance and enhances the understanding of the trends in our property and casualty business that may be obscured by these items.  

Global P&C performance metrics comprise consolidated operating results (including corporate) and exclude the operating results of the company’s Life and Insurance – North American Agriculture segments. We believe that these measures are useful and meaningful to investors as they are used by management to assess the company’s global P&C operations which are the most economically similar. We exclude the Insurance – North American Agriculture and Life segments because the results of these businesses do not always correlate with the results of our global P&C operations.  

International life net premiums written and deposits collected, is adjusted to include deposits collected on universal life and investment contracts (life deposits). Life deposits are not reflected as revenues in our consolidated statements of operations in accordance with GAAP. However, we include life deposits in presenting growth in our life insurance business because new life deposits are an important component of production and key to our efforts to grow our business.  

Operating return on equity (ROE) or ROE calculated using operating income is an annualized financial measure. The ROE numerator includes income adjusted to exclude adjusted net realized gains (losses), net of tax and Chubb integration expenses, net of tax. The ROE denominator includes the average shareholders’ equity for the period adjusted to exclude unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. To annualize a quarterly rate, multiply by four. Annualized ROE  

 Chubb®, Chubb logo® and Chubb. Insured.SM are trademarks of Chubb Limited.   7 

Chubb Limited News Release  

calculated using operating income is a useful measure as it enhances the understanding of the return on shareholders’ equity by highlighting the underlying profitability relative to shareholders’ equity excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on our investments.  

Tangible book value per common share is shareholders’ equity less goodwill and other intangible assets divided by the shares outstanding. We believe that goodwill and other intangible assets are not indicative of our underlying insurance results or trends and make book value comparisons to less acquisitive peer companies less meaningful. In addition, we disclose per share measures for book value and tangible book value that exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations during 2015 in order to adjust for the distortive effects of fluctuations in exchange rates.  

Other income (expense) – operating excludes from consolidated Other income (expense) the portion of net realized gains and losses related to unconsolidated entities and gains and losses from fair value changes in separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under GAAP. Net realized gains (losses) related to unconsolidated entities is excluded from operating income in order to enhance the understanding of our core results of operations as they are heavily influenced by, and fluctuate in part according to market conditions.  

Chubb integration and related expenses include legal and professional fees and all costs directly related to the integration activities of the Chubb acquisition as well as the pre-acquisition interest expense related to the $5.3 billion senior notes issued in November 2015 to finance a portion of the Chubb acquisition. We exclude this pre-acquisition interest expense from operating income because the operations for which the debt was issued were not part of our operating activities prior to the completion of the acquisition. Effective with the close of the Chubb acquisition (January 14, 2016), this debt will be considered a cost of our operations and will then be included within operating income.  

See reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 22-25 in the Chubb Limited (Legacy ACE) Financial Supplement. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for net income, return on equity, or effective tax rate determined in accordance with GAAP.

Chubb Limited News Release  

The discussion of The Chubb Corporation represents Legacy Chubb results for fourth quarter and full year 2015 on a standalone basis and does not include the results of Legacy ACE.  

Chubb Limited Reports Legacy Chubb Fourth Quarter Net Income per Share of $2.88; Operating Income per Share of $2.03; Combined Ratio of 86.3%  

Net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015 was $666 million compared to $558 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income per share increased 23% to $2.88 from $2.35. Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, was $469 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $544 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating income per share decreased 11% to $2.03 from $2.29. Operating income decreased due to both lower underwriting income and lower property and casualty investment income. Underwriting income was adversely affected by the impact of higher catastrophe losses of $0.14 per share and investment income decreased $0.03 per share due to a decline in the average yield on the portfolio in part due to the accumulation of short term invested assets in preparation for the merger and unfavorable foreign currency movement. Operating income per share also reflected the impact of one-time expenses related to the merger with Legacy ACE of $0.09 per share and a decline in investment income.

For the year, property and casualty investment income after taxes declined 5% to $1.0 billion in 2015 from $1.1 billion in 2014. The decline in both the quarter and the year was due to a decline in the average yield of the investment portfolio compared to the average yield in the comparable period in the prior year and unfavorable foreign currency movement. The decrease in the average yield resulted primarily from lower reinvestment yields available on securities purchased during the year. The decline in investment income also reflected the accumulation of short term invested assets in preparation for the merger.

Definitions of Key Terms  

Operating Income:  

Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.  

Underwriting Income (Loss):  

Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is measured based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from GAAP. Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.  

Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, certain policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.  

Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax:  

Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment results because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of tax exempt investment income to total investment income and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.  

Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio:  

The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) and the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.  

Net Written Premiums Growth (Decrease) in Constant Dollars:  

Management uses growth in net premiums written in constant dollars, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the trends in net premiums written, exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currencies in which business is transacted. The impact of foreign currency translation is excluded as exchange rates may fluctuate significantly and the effect of fluctuations could distort the analysis of trends. When excluding the effect of foreign currency translation on growth, management uses the current period average exchange rates to translate both the current period and the prior period foreign currency denominated net premiums written amounts.
