Franklin Lakes, NJ (February 3, 2016) – BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly adjusted revenues of $2.992 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 45.9 percent over the prior-year period as reported, or 53.8 percent on a currency-neutral basis. On a comparable, currency-neutral basis, first quarter adjusted revenues grew 1.8 percent. As reported, first quarter revenues were $2.986 billion.  

“We are pleased with our solid start and outlook for fiscal year 2016,” said Vincent A. Forlenza, Chairman, CEO and President. “Both segments contributed to growth and we expanded our operating margins as we continued to make investments to support our innovation strategy.”  

All “comparable” basis revenue growth rates presented throughout this release include the results of CareFusion in the current and prior-year periods. For reconciliations of these revenue amounts and growth rates to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the tables at the end of this release.  

First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Operating Results  

Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.96, compared with $1.53 in the prior-year period. This represents an increase of 28.1 percent, or 45.8 percent on a currency-neutral basis. On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.06 compared with $1.20 in the prior-year period.  

Current and prior-year adjusted results exclude the impact of the non-cash amortization of intangible assets and other certain specified items. These specified items are detailed in the accompanying reconciliation of reported diluted earnings per share to adjusted diluted earnings per share.  

Segment Results  

In the BD Medical segment, worldwide adjusted revenues for the quarter were $2.060 billion, an increase of 92.1 percent over the prior-year period as reported, or 101.4 percent on a currency-neutral basis. On a comparable, currency-neutral basis, adjusted Medical revenues grew 1.9 percent. The segment’s revenue growth reflects solid performance across the Medication Management Solutions, Medication and Procedural Solutions, Pharmaceutical Systems, and Diabetes Care units, partially offset by a decline in the Respiratory Solutions unit. The segment’s results were also impacted by unfavorable comparisons to the prior year, as expected. On a reported basis, Medical revenues were $2.054 billion.  

In the BD Life Sciences segment, worldwide revenues for the quarter were $933 million, a decrease of 4.8 percent from the prior-year period, or an increase of 1.7 percent on a currency-neutral basis. The segment’s results reflect solid growth in the Preanalytical Systems unit and the Biosciences unit. Revenues in the Diagnostic Systems unit declined slightly as growth in both microbiology and molecular were offset by a weaker-than-expected flu season.  

Geographic Results  

First quarter adjusted revenues in the U.S. of $1.697 billion represent an increase of 92.6 percent over the prior-year period as reported. On a comparable basis, adjusted U.S. revenues increased 1.5 percent. Within the BD Medical segment, growth was driven by strong sales in the Diabetes Care unit. Results across the other units in the segment were impacted by unfavorable comparisons to the prior year. Growth in the BD Life Sciences segment was driven by strong performance in the Biosciences unit and solid growth in the Preanalytical Systems unit. The decline in the Diagnostic Systems unit was driven by the aforementioned weaker-than-expected flu season. On a reported basis, U.S. revenues were $1.691 billion.  

Revenues outside of the U.S. were $1.295 billion, representing an increase of 10.7 percent over the prior-year period, or an increase of 24.6 percent on a currency-neutral basis. On a comparable, currency-neutral basis, international revenues grew 2.2 percent. This reflects continued strength in Europe and sales of safety-engineered products. This was partially offset by timing of tenders and capital installations, and slower growth in China, as well as unfavorable comparisons to the prior year in emerging markets.  

Fiscal 2016 Outlook for Full Year  

The Company continues to estimate that currency-neutral adjusted revenues for the full fiscal year 2016, including the accretion from the acquisition of CareFusion, will increase 24.5 to 25.0 percent.  

 Including the impact of foreign currency, as adjusted and as reported, revenues are now expected to increase 20.0 to 20.5 percent. This is a decrease from previously issued guidance of 23.0 to 23.5 percent growth. On a comparable, currency-neutral basis, the Company continues to estimate organic adjusted revenues will increase 4.5 to 5.0 percent.  

The Company continues to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $8.37 and $8.44 for the full fiscal year 2016 including the estimated unfavorable impact from foreign currency. This represents growth of approximately 17.0 to 18.0 percent. On a currency-neutral basis, the Company now expects full-year fiscal 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $9.01 and $9.08, which represents growth of approximately 26.0 to 27.0 percent over 2015 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $7.16. This is an increase from previously issued currency-neutral guidance of $8.73 to $8.80 which represented approximately 22.0 to 23.0 percent growth. Adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude, among other specified items, the non-cash amortization of intangible assets, and include approximately 22.0 percentage points of accretion from the CareFusion acquisition. As reported, the Company expects full fiscal year diluted earnings per share to be between $6.23 and $6.30.
