Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

The information in this Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto is furnished and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

On February 16, 2016, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) issued its press release announcing financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2016. A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors’ overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future. We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to the GAAP presentation. Management measures segment and enterprise performance using measures such as those that are disclosed in this release. This information facilitates management’s internal comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results and comparisons to competitors’ operating results. Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operations decision making. Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.

This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company’s expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company. The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
