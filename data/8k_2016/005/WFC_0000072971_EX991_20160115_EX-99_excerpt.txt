Selected Financial Information

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

SAN FRANCISCO – Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported diluted earnings per common share of $4.15 for 2015, compared with $4.10 in 2014. Full year net income was $23.0 billion, compared with $23.1 billion in 2014. For fourth quarter 2015, net income was $5.7 billion, or $1.03 per share, compared with $5.7 billion, or $1.02 per share, for fourth quarter 2014, and $5.8 billion, or $1.05 per share, for third quarter 2015.

Chairman and CEO John Stumpf said, “Full year and fourth quarter 2015 results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model as we again generated strong financial results, maintained our risk discipline and continued to invest across the company for future growth. We remained focused on the building blocks of long-term shareholder value, with continued growth in loans, deposits and capital. For the 5th consecutive year, we returned more capital to shareholders than the prior year. I am proud of the dedication of our team members and their focus on helping our customers succeed financially."

Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry added, “Our performance in the fourth quarter reflected a continuation of the solid results we generated all year and the ability of our diversified business model to perform consistently across cycles. Compared with the prior quarter, we increased deposits and grew both commercial and consumer loans, while maintaining our credit and pricing discipline. Net interest income increased as we benefited from broad-based earning asset growth, and fee income remained diversified. We continued to have strong liquidity and capital levels, and our net payout ratio4 was stable at 59 percent."

4 Net payout ratio means the ratio of (i) common stock dividends and share repurchases less issuances and stock compensation-related items, divided by (ii) net income applicable to common stock.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income in the fourth quarter increased $131 million from third quarter 2015 to $11.6 billion, largely driven by growth in earning assets. Income from variable sources, including periodic dividends, loan recoveries and fees included in interest income, also increased in the quarter. Net interest income also benefited modestly from the increase in short-term interest rates late in the quarter. These benefits to net interest income were partially offset by reduced income from seasonally lower balances of mortgages held-for-sale and increased interest expense from higher debt balances.

Net interest margin was 2.92 percent, down 4 basis points from third quarter 2015. Income from variable sources improved the net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points linked-quarter, but was more than offset by customer-driven deposit growth, which had a minimal impact to net interest income but was dilutive to the net interest margin by 3 basis points. All other growth, mix and repricing reduced the margin by 3 basis points, largely driven by increased debt balances, including funding raised in anticipation of closing the previously announced acquisitions of certain commercial lending businesses and assets from GE Capital.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income in the fourth quarter was $10.0 billion, compared with $10.4 billion in third quarter 2015, down due to lower equity investment gains, which were elevated in the third quarter. Noninterest income benefited from higher debt securities gains, trading income (reflecting higher deferred compensation plan investment results which were largely offset in employee benefits expense), commercial real estate brokerage fees, mortgage banking, investment banking, card fees and insurance fees. 

Mortgage banking noninterest income was $1.7 billion, up $71 million from third quarter, primarily driven by higher net servicing income. During the fourth quarter, residential mortgage loan originations were $47 billion, down $8 billion linked quarter on seasonality. The production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage loan originations5 was 1.83 percent, compared with 1.88 percent in third quarter. Net mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) results were $417 million, compared with $253 million in third quarter 2015.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter was $12.4 billion, stable compared with third quarter 2015. Fourth quarter expenses included typically higher equipment, outside professional services and advertising, as well as an increase in deferred compensation expense (included in employee benefits expense and largely offset in revenue). These higher expenses were offset by lower operating losses, commissions and incentive compensation, as well as lower charitable donations, which were elevated in the third quarter due to a $126 million contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. Foreclosed asset expense also declined in the quarter, driven primarily by commercial real estate recoveries. The efficiency ratio was 57.4 percent in fourth quarter 2015, compared with 56.7 percent in the prior quarter. The Company expects to operate at the higher end of its targeted efficiency ratio range of 55 to 59 percent for full year 2016.

Loans 

Total loans were $916.6 billion at December 31, 2015, up $13.3 billion from September 30, 2015. Fourth quarter loan growth was broad-based across all portfolios (other than real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgages) and did not include any loan portfolio acquisitions. Core loan growth was $15.4 billion, or 2 percent, as non-strategic/liquidating portfolios declined $2.1 billion in the quarter. Total average loans were $912.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up $17.2 billion from the prior quarter. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)See table on page 32 for additional information on non-strategic/liquidating loan portfolios. Management believes that the above information provides useful disclosure regarding the Company’s ongoing loan portfolios.

Investment Securities

Investment securities were $347.6 billion at December 31, 2015, up $2.5 billion from third quarter. The Company purchased approximately $25 billion of securities (mostly federal agency mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury securities), which were offset by maturities, amortization and sales.

Net unrealized available-for-sale securities gains of $3.0 billion at December 31, 2015, declined from $4.9 billion at September 30, 2015, primarily due to rising rates and realized gains on debt and equity securities.

Deposits

Total average deposits for fourth quarter 2015 were $1.2 trillion, up 6 percent from a year ago, driven by both commercial and consumer growth. The average deposit cost for fourth quarter 2015 was 8 basis points, which was down 1 basis point from a year ago and unchanged from the prior quarter. The increase in deposits reflected strong account growth as the number of primary consumer checking customers6 increased 5.6 percent year-over-year7 and primary small business and business banking checking customers6 increased 4.8 percent year-over-year7. 

Capital

Capital levels remained strong in the fourth quarter, with Common Equity Tier 1 (fully phased-in) of $142.5 billion, or 10.7 percent3. In fourth quarter 2015, the Company purchased 27.0 million shares of its common stock and entered into a $500 million forward repurchase transaction for an additional 9.2 million shares which settled early in first quarter 2016. The Company paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.375 per share, up from $0.35 per share a year ago.

Credit Quality

“The trend of strong credit results continued in the fourth quarter," said Chief Risk Officer Mike Loughlin. "The quarterly loss rate (annualized) remained low at 0.36 percent and nonperforming assets declined by $497 million, or 15 percent (annualized), from the prior quarter. The allowance for credit losses in the fourth quarter was stable (no reserve build or release) as continued credit quality improvements in the residential real estate portfolio were offset by higher commercial reserves reflecting continued deterioration within the energy sector. Future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions.”

Net Loan Charge-offs

The quarterly loss rate (annualized) of 0.36 percent reflected commercial losses of 0.16 percent and consumer losses of 0.56 percent. Credit losses were $831 million in fourth quarter 2015, compared with $703 million in the third quarter, mainly due to $90 million in higher oil and gas portfolio losses, as well as seasonal increases in the non-real estate consumer portfolios.

Net Loan Charge-Offs

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets declined by $497 million from third quarter 2015 to $12.8 billion. Nonaccrual loans decreased $155 million to $11.4 billion driven by improvements in commercial and consumer real estate portfolios, partially offset by an increase in commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans, primarily related to deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio. Foreclosed assets were $1.4 billion, down from $1.8 billion in third quarter 2015.

Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Loans 90 Days or More Past Due and Still Accruing

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing (excluding government insured/guaranteed) totaled $981 million at December 31, 2015, up from $872 million at September 30, 2015. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing with repayments insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or predominantly guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for mortgage loans and the U.S. Department of Education for student loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program were $13.4 billion at December 31, 2015, down from $13.5 billion at September 30, 2015.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $12.5 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $12.6 billion at September 30, 2015. The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.37 percent, compared with 1.39 percent in third quarter 2015. The allowance covered 3.8 times annualized fourth quarter net charge-offs, compared with 4.5 times in the prior quarter. The allowance coverage for nonaccrual loans was 110 percent at December 31, 2015, compared with 109 percent at September 30, 2015. “We believe the allowance was appropriate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2015,” said Loughlin.

Business Segment Performance 

Wells Fargo defines its operating segments by product type and customer segment. Effective fourth quarter 2015, we realigned our business banking and merchant payment services businesses from Community Banking to Wholesale Banking. Results for these operating segments were revised for prior periods to reflect the impact of this realignment. Segment net income for each of the three business segments was:

Selected Financial Information

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Community Banking reported net income of $3.3 billion, down $257 million, or 7 percent, from third quarter 2015. Revenue of $12.3 billion decreased $603 million, or 5 percent, from third quarter 2015 due to lower equity investment gains and lower other income, partially offset by gains on deferred compensation plan investments (offset in employee benefits expense) and higher gains on sales of debt securities. Noninterest expense decreased $85 million, or 1 percent, due to a donation to the Wells Fargo Foundation in the prior quarter, as well as lower operating losses, partially offset by higher deferred compensation plan expense (offset in trading revenue), project-related expense, and advertising costs. The provision for credit losses increased $36 million from the prior quarter primarily due to higher net charge-offs. 

Net income was down $30 million, or 1 percent, from fourth quarter 2014. Revenue was up $172 million, or 1 percent, compared with a year ago due to higher net interest income, market sensitive revenue, primarily equity investment gains and gains on sale of debt securities, mortgage banking fees, deposit service charges, debit and credit card fees, and trust and investment fees, partially offset by a gain on sale of government guaranteed student loans in the prior year. Noninterest expense decreased $134 million, or 2 percent, from a year ago driven by lower foreclosed assets expense, partially offset by higher equipment expenses and operating losses. The provision for

credit losses increased $198 million from a year ago as the $48 million improvement in net charge-offs was more than offset by the absence of a reserve release in fourth quarter 2015.

Noninterest income increased $133 million, or 5 percent, on strong results in commercial real estate related businesses with growth in commercial real estate brokerage, multi-family capital, structured real estate and community lending, as well as higher investment banking fees, equity fund investments gains and crop insurance underwriting gains, partially offset by lower customer accommodation trading revenue. Noninterest expense decreased $12 million as higher variable compensation expenses were more than offset by lower operating losses and foreclosed assets expense. The provision for credit losses increased $90 million from prior quarter due to increased loan losses primarily related to the oil and gas portfolio. 

Net income was up $9 million from fourth quarter 2014. Revenue increased $27 million from fourth quarter 2014, on $78 million, or 2 percent, growth in net interest income related to strong loan and deposit growth, offset by a $51 million, or 2 percent, decline in noninterest income. Noninterest income declined as higher commercial real estate brokerage, structured real estate, and multi-family capital results as well as increased equity fund investment gains and higher crop insurance underwriting gains were offset by lower customer accommodation trading revenues, energy portfolio write-downs and lower investment banking fees. Noninterest expense increased $42 million, or 1 percent, from a year ago primarily due to higher personnel expenses related to growth initiatives, compliance, and regulatory requirements.

CHANGES IN ACCRETABLE YIELD RELATED TO PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS

Loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are considered to be credit impaired. PCI loans predominantly represent loans acquired from Wachovia that were deemed to be credit impaired. Evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status, recent borrower credit scores and recent LTV percentages. PCI loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan. Accordingly, the associated allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not carried over at the acquisition date.

As a result of PCI loan accounting, certain credit-related ratios cannot be used to compare a portfolio that includes PCI loans against one that does not, or to compare ratios across quarters or years. The ratios particularly affected include the allowance for loan losses and allowance for credit losses as percentages of loans, of nonaccrual loans and of nonperforming assets; nonaccrual loans and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans; and net charge-offs as a percentage of loans.

The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is accreted into interest income over the estimated lives of the PCI loans using the effective yield method. The accretable yield is affected by:

•Changes in interest rate indices for variable rate PCI loans - Expected future cash flows are based on the variable rates in effect at the time of the quarterly assessment of expected cash flows;

•Changes in prepayment assumptions - Prepayments affect the estimated life of PCI loans which may change the amount of interest income, and possibly principal, expected to be collected; and

•Changes in the expected principal and interest payments over the estimated life - Updates to changes in expected cash flows are driven by the credit outlook and actions taken with borrowers. Changes in expected future cash flows from loan modifications are included in the regular evaluations of cash flows expected to be collected.

The change in the accretable yield related to PCI loans is presented in the following table.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes accretable yield released as a result of settlements with borrowers, which is included in interest income.

(2)Includes accretable yield released as a result of sales to third parties, which is included in noninterest income.

(3)Represents changes in cash flows expected to be collected due to the impact of modifications, changes in prepayment assumptions, changes in interest rates on variable rate PCI loans and sales to third parties.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

PICK-A-PAY PORTFOLIO (1)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The individual states shown in this table represent the top five states based on the total net carrying value of the Pick-a-Pay loans at the beginning of 2015.

(2)Adjusted unpaid principal balance includes write-downs taken on loans where severe delinquency (normally 180 days) or other indications of severe borrower financial stress exist that indicate there will be a loss of contractually due amounts upon final resolution of the loan.

(3)The current LTV ratio is calculated as the adjusted unpaid principal balance divided by the collateral value. Collateral values are generally determined using automated valuation models (AVM) and are updated quarterly. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate market values of homes based on processing large volumes of market data including market comparables and price trends for local market areas.

(4)Carrying value, which does not reflect the allowance for loan losses, includes remaining purchase accounting adjustments, which, for PCI loans may include the nonaccretable difference and the accretable yield and, for all other loans, an adjustment to mark the loans to a market yield at date of merger less any subsequent charge-offs.

(5)The ratio of carrying value to current value is calculated as the carrying value divided by the collateral value.

COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 UNDER BASEL III (FULLY PHASED-IN) (1) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Basel III capital rules, adopted by the Federal Reserve Board on July 2, 2013, revised the definition of capital, increased minimum capital ratios, and introduced a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio. These rules established a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations that implements the Basel III capital framework and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The rules are being phased in through the end of 2021. Fully phased-in capital amounts, ratios and RWAs are calculated assuming the full phase-in of the Basel III capital rules. Fully phased-in regulatory capital amounts, ratios and RWAs are considered non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management, bank regulatory agencies, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Company’s capital position. We have included this non-GAAP financial information, and the corresponding reconciliation to total equity, because of current interest in such information on the part of market participants.

(2)Goodwill and other intangible assets are net of any associated deferred tax liabilities.

(3)The final Basel III capital rules provide for two capital frameworks: the Standardized Approach, which replaced Basel I, and the Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions. Under the final rules, we are subject to the lower of our CET1 ratio calculated under the Standardized Approach and under the Advanced Approach in the assessment of our capital adequacy. Because the final determination of our CET1 ratio and which approach will produce the lower CET1 ratio as of December 31, 2015, is subject to detailed analysis of considerable data, our CET1 ratio at that date has been estimated using the Basel III definition of capital under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs. The capital ratio for September 30, 2015, and June 30, 2015, was calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs, and the capital ratio for March 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, was calculated under the Basel III Advanced Approach RWAs.

(4)The Company’s December 31, 2015, RWAs and capital ratio are preliminary estimates.
