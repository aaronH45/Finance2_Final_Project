Explanatory Note  

Noble Energy, Inc. (the “Company”) is filing this Amendment No. 1 to the Form 8-K originally filed by the Company on January 29, 2016 (the “Original 8-K”) to include additional disclosure under Items 5.02 and 9.01 regarding a revised form of performance-based restricted stock agreement for the Company’s principal executive officer.  

Except for the following disclosures, this amendment does not modify or update any other disclosures contained in the Original 8-K. This amendment supplements and does not supersede the Original 8-K and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with the Original 8-K.  

 Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

In lieu of restricted stock and cash awards granted under the new form of performance award agreement for executive officers, the principal executive officer of the Company instead will receive an award of performance-vesting restricted stock that vests based upon the Company’s relative total shareholder return (versus the compensation peer group) during a three-year performance period, as shown in the chart below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

If the percentile level of our total stockholder return ranking falls between two levels indicated above, the amount vested will be determined on the basis of a straight-line interpolation between the two levels. Dividends (to the extent declared) will be paid on restricted shares equal to the amount paid to other shareholders. However, these dividends will be retained by the Company and will only vest and be paid if and when the related restricted shares vest.  

The foregoing description of the revised form of performance-vested restricted stock agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of that agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.8 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
