 compared with $316 million, or $0.47 diluted EPS, in 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 results include special items of $452 million, or $0.67 diluted EPS, driven largely by non-cash goodwill and asset impairments totaling $445 million.  

Ongoing net income from controlling interests was $775 million in 2015, or $1.15 diluted EPS, compared with $1.09 billion, or $1.62 diluted EPS, during the prior year. Reported net income from controlling interests was $196 million in 2015, or $0.29 diluted EPS, compared with $1.08 billion, or $1.61 diluted EPS, in 2014. Full year 2015 results include special items of $579 million, or $0.86 diluted EPS, driven largely by non-cash goodwill and asset impairments totaling $561 million.  

Tables detailing the fourth quarter and full-year special items are shown later in this release.  

CEO COMMENT  

“Our 2015 results illustrate the resiliency of our business model. Even in a year with dramatically lower commodity prices and a lower Canadian dollar than we had projected, we managed to beat our DCF expectations by 7 percent and ended the year with a higher than expected dividend coverage ratio of 1.3 times,” said Greg Ebel, chief executive officer, Spectra Energy. “We continued to build on our solid natural gas transmission portfolio, which generates 90 percent of its revenue from long-term, fixed-fee contracts with high credit-quality customers and little volume risk. As a result of this stability, we are positioned to continue providing reliable and growing dividends for our investors, as demonstrated by the 14-cent per share increase for 2016 that we recently announced.  

“Looking forward, we continue to have more than $8 billion of contractually secured projects in our execution backlog, 75 percent of which are supported by demand-pull customers such as local utilities. The growing demand for our assets, as well as the decisive actions we took in 2015 to strengthen our business, have prepared us well for 2016 and beyond.”

SEGMENT RESULTS  

Spectra Energy Partners  

Spectra Energy Partners reported fourth quarter 2015 EBITDA of $484 million, compared with $444 million in fourth quarter 2014. These results reflect increased earnings from expansion projects in the natural gas transmission business. The increase was partially offset by lower equity earnings from Sand Hills and Southern Hills natural gas liquids (NGL) pipelines, which Spectra Energy Partners owned for approximately one month of the quarter.  

Year-end 2015 ongoing EBITDA for Spectra Energy Partners was $1.91 billion, compared with $1.67 billion in 2014. The 2015 period excludes a special item of $9 million related to a non-cash impairment of the Ozark Gas Gathering asset.  

Distribution  

Distribution reported fourth quarter 2015 EBITDA of $113 million, compared with $132 million in fourth quarter 2014. The decrease was mainly due to the effect of a lower Canadian dollar.  

Year-end 2015 EBITDA for Distribution was $473 million, compared with $552 million in 2014.  

Western Canada Transmission & Processing  

Western Canada Transmission & Processing fourth quarter 2015 ongoing EBITDA was $123 million, compared with $250 million in fourth quarter 2014. The 2015 period excludes special items of $7 million for employee and overhead reductions and $7 million for a non-cash asset impairment. The segment’s ongoing results reflect the effect of a lower Canadian dollar and lower earnings at Empress, largely due to the net effect of the unrealized mark-to-market value associated with the risk management program.  

Page 3  

Year-end 2015 ongoing EBITDA for Western Canada Transmission & Processing was $516 million, compared with $754 million in 2014. The 2015 period excludes special items totaling $25 million, which were primarily associated with employee and overhead reductions.  

Field Services  

Spectra Energy reported ongoing EBITDA from Field Services of $(36) million in fourth quarter 2015, compared with $(18) million in fourth quarter 2014. The 2015 period excludes special items of $172 million, primarily from non-cash asset impairments as a result of the continuing low commodity price environment. The decrease in ongoing EBITDA was primarily attributable to lower commodity prices, partially offset by asset growth, improved operating efficiencies, and other initiatives, as well as the increase in ownership of the Sand Hills and Southern Hills NGL pipelines for approximately two months of the quarter. As a reminder, Spectra Energy’s EBITDA from Field Services represents the company’s 50 percent share of DCP Midstream’s net income plus gains from DPM unit issuances.  

During the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively, NGL prices averaged $0.42 per gallon versus $0.68 per gallon, NYMEX natural gas averaged $2.27 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) versus $4.00 per MMBtu, and crude oil averaged approximately $42 per barrel versus $73 per barrel.  

On a full-year basis for 2015 and 2014, respectively, NGL prices averaged $0.45 per gallon versus $0.89 per gallon, NYMEX natural gas averaged $2.66 per MMBtu versus $4.41 per MMBtu, and crude oil averaged approximately $49 per barrel versus $93 per barrel.  

Year-end 2015 ongoing EBITDA for Field Services was $(106) million, compared with $229 million in 2014. The 2015 period excludes special items of $355 million, primarily due to non-cash goodwill and asset impairments. The 2014 period excludes special items of $12 million, primarily due to a non-cash goodwill impairment.

Other  

“Other” reported ongoing net expenses of $12 million and a net benefit of $2 million in the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflecting higher corporate costs, including employee benefits costs. Full-year 2015 ongoing net expenses for “Other” were $51 million, compared with $58 million in 2014. Both the 2015 quarter and year-end periods exclude a special item of $333 million related to non-cash goodwill impairments associated with the Westcoast acquisition in 2002.  

“Other” primarily consists of corporate expenses, including benefits, and captive insurance.  

ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

Interest Expense  

Interest expense was $156 million in fourth quarter 2015, compared with $158 million in fourth quarter 2014, reflecting a lower Canadian dollar and lower average rates, partially offset by higher average long-term debt balances.  

Income Taxes  

Excluding a $62 million tax benefit related to asset impairments in the current quarter, income tax expense was $59 million in fourth quarter 2015, compared with $77 million in fourth quarter 2014. The decrease in tax expense was mainly due to lower earnings and a lower effective state tax rate. 

Excluding the tax impact of special items, the effective tax rate was 20 percent in fourth quarter 2015, compared with 17 percent in fourth quarter 2014.  

Page 5  

Foreign Currency  

Net income from controlling interests for the quarter was lower by $6 million due to the lower Canadian dollar.  

Liquidity and Capital Expenditures  

Total debt outstanding at Spectra Energy as of December 31, 2015, was $14.7 billion. Total Spectra Energy liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion, including $1.7 billion of available liquidity at Spectra Energy Partners. Total capital and investment spending for the quarter was $1.06 billion, excluding contributions from noncontrolling interests. The spending consisted of $848 million of growth capital expenditures and $216 million of maintenance capital expenditures.  

For the year, total capital and investment spending was $2.97 billion, excluding contributions from noncontrolling interests, and was mainly comprised of approximately $2.28 billion of growth capital expenditures and $691 million of maintenance capital expenditures.

EXPANSION PROJECT UPDATES  

Spectra Energy continues to make progress on securing $35 billion in new projects by the end of the decade. At the end of 2015, the company had:  

   •   $10.1 billion – in service and delivering solid cash flows  

   •   $8.2 billion – in execution  

   •   $20+ billion – in development  

Spectra Energy Partners  

Spectra Energy Partners has advanced numerous projects across the system. The company filed Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) certificate applications in the quarter for the Atlantic Bridge, Access South, Adair Southwest, and Lebanon Extension projects.  

The NEXUS project, which is supported by local distribution companies (LDCs) as well as Marcellus and Utica producers, also filed its application with FERC, and reached another regulatory milestone in the quarter with the receipt of Ontario Energy Board (OEB) approval for the Canadian utility shippers. The joint venture with DTE will allow customers to move up to 1.5 billion cubic feet per day  

Page 7  

 (Bcf/d) through Ohio and Michigan markets to the Dawn Hub, which is the second largest physically traded gas hub in North America and is owned and operated by Union Gas. NEXUS has secured additional connections with four natural gas distribution companies in Ohio, including the two largest in the state, two natural gas-fired power plants, and three industrial parks, demonstrating the value of the project path connecting to the largest natural gas supply source in North America. These connections could add incremental load across northern Ohio of up to 1.4 Bcf/d. NEXUS is on target for a November 2017 in-service date.  

The AIM project, supported by New England LDCs, has made significant construction progress and is well on the way to its planned in-service date in the second half of 2016. A number of other projects are on track to meet their respective in-service dates, including the Sabal Trail, Ozark, Salem Lateral, Gulf Markets, Loudon Expansion, TEAL, and PennEast projects.  

In the liquids business, the Express Enhancement project is supported by long-term contracts and is on schedule for completion by the end of 2016. The strong response to this system optimization project demonstrates that the Express pipeline’s incumbent position is a substantial advantage in responding quickly to market demand.  

Access Northeast is focused on the New England electric power market and saving consumers money while improving the reliability of the region’s energy system. This solution maximizes existing infrastructure corridors, by utilizing the Algonquin and Maritimes & Northeast pipelines, which directly connect to more than 60 percent of the ISO-New England power plants. In addition, the four new natural gas-fired electric generation plants that have cleared the 2017 and 2018 ISO-NE forward capacity auctions will be located on the Algonquin pipeline, further demonstrating the company’s very strong position in New England.  

Access Northeast will carry natural gas from the least expensive supply areas, via multiple optional paths, directly to the majority of the power plants in New England. It will cost-effectively deliver supply when power generators need it, with new tariff services to handle the peak hour, quick start, and seasonal needs.  

Page 8  

Access Northeast submitted its FERC pre-file application during the quarter and has recently executed electric distribution contracts in Massachusetts equaling more than 40 percent of the 0.9 Bcf/d capacity designed for generators. Progress is being made in other states, and Access Northeast anticipates state approvals for contracts later this year. The project continues to advance toward a late 2018 initial in-service date.  

Distribution  

Union Gas’ storage and transmission system continues to grow and increase in importance to Eastern Canada and the Northeast U.S.  

The 2015 Dawn-Parkway expansion project was placed into service on time and under budget during the quarter. Future growth opportunities also solidified with OEB approvals for the 2016 and 2017 Dawn-Parkway expansions, along with the Burlington-Oakville transmission reinforcement project. These expansion projects are now in execution and on schedule for their respective in-service dates.  

Western Canada Transmission & Processing  

Western Canada originated two new supply-push projects in 2015, totaling about 290 million cubic feet per day in capacity: High Pine and Wyndwood. These projects are underpinned by long-term contracts with Montney producers holding substantial land bases and seeking markets at Station 2 in British Columbia, AECO in Alberta, as well as export markets via multiple paths. High Pine is on schedule to go into service in 2016, while Wyndwood, which was placed into execution in the fourth quarter, has an expected in-service date of 2018. Both projects will drive growth on the company’s BC Pipeline, which provides producer access to downstream markets.  

Page 9  

The Jackfish Lake project is proceeding on schedule to be in service in 2017. The RAM project will increase reliability and maintainability on our fully contracted 1.5 Bcf/d T-South system, is proceeding on schedule, and will come on-line in stages, with full in-service in 2018. Upon completion, RAM will allow significantly higher summer load factors than previous years, to meet increased demands for low-cost British Columbia production in the Pacific Northwest.  

High Pine, Jackfish Lake and RAM were all filed with the National Energy Board (NEB) during the quarter.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

We use ongoing net income from controlling interests and ongoing diluted EPS as measures to evaluate operations of the company. These measures are non-GAAP  

Page 10  

 financial measures as they represent net income from controlling interests and diluted EPS, excluding special items. Special items represent certain charges and credits which we believe will not be recurring on a regular basis. We believe that the presentation of ongoing net income from controlling interests and ongoing diluted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it allows investors to more accurately compare our ongoing performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for ongoing net income from controlling interests and ongoing diluted EPS are reported net income from controlling interests and reported diluted EPS.  

We use earnings from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and ongoing EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measures, as performance measures for Spectra Energy Corp. Ongoing EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding special items. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA and ongoing EBITDA provides useful information to investors, as it allows investors to more accurately compare Spectra Energy Corp’s performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for EBITDA and ongoing EBITDA for Spectra Energy Corp is net income.  

The primary performance measure used by us to evaluate segment performance is segment EBITDA. We consider segment EBITDA, which is the GAAP measure used to report segment results, to be a good indicator of each segment’s operating performance from its continuing operations as it represents the results of our segments’ operations before depreciation and amortization without regard to financing methods or capital structures. Our segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner.  

Page 11  

We also use ongoing segment EBITDA and ongoing Other EBITDA (net expenses) as measures of performance. Ongoing segment EBITDA and ongoing Other EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures, as they represent reported segment EBITDA and reported Other EBITDA, excluding special items. We believe that the presentation of ongoing segment EBITDA and ongoing Other EBITDA provides useful information to investors, as it allows investors to more accurately compare a segment’s or Other’s ongoing performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for ongoing segment EBITDA and ongoing Other EBITDA are reported segment EBITDA and reported Other EBITDA.  

We have also presented Distributable Cash Flow (DCF), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the presentation of DCF provides useful information to investors, as it represents the cash generation capabilities of the company to support dividend growth. We also use ongoing DCF, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it represents DCF excluding the cash effect of special items. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for DCF and ongoing DCF is net income. We also use DCF coverage, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it represents DCF divided by dividends declared on common stock. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for DCF coverage is reported EPS.  

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate these measures in the same manner.
