Diluted Earnings per Share of $0.46, Excluding $0.22 of Charges

•Full-year Subsea Technologies inbound orders of $3.1 billion

•Full-year Subsea Technologies operating margins of 15.1 percent, excluding charges

•Full-year earnings per share of $2.27, excluding $0.57 of charges

Houston, February 16, 2016 - FMC Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:FTI) today reported fourth quarter 2015 revenue of $1.4 billion, down 34 percent from the prior-year quarter. The significant decline was driven by the sharp reduction in North American land activity, lower revenues in our Subsea Technologies segment, and the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Diluted earnings per share were $0.24, which includes total Company pre-tax restructuring and other severance and impairment charges of $31.4 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Operating results also include $42 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for inventory write-down charges related to the severe activity decline in the North American land market.

Total inbound orders were $833.9 million, including $490 million in Subsea Technologies orders. Backlog for the Company was $4.4 billion, including Subsea Technologies backlog of $3.8 billion.

Full Year 2015 Results

Total Company revenue for 2015 was $6.4 billion, and operating profit was $694.2 million. Full-year 2015 diluted earnings per share were $2.27, which excludes $131.9 million of pre-tax impairment, restructuring and other severance charges, or $0.43 per diluted share, and also excludes $48.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for inventory write-down charges.

Full-year results were significantly impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar. Foreign currency negatively impacted revenues by $652.5 million. The negative foreign currency impact to operating profit was $72.5 million.

“Despite 2015 being a challenging year for the industry, we achieved our Subsea Technologies order forecast of at least $3 billion and successfully delivered full-year subsea margins of 15.1 percent, excluding charges,” said John Gremp, Chairman and CEO of FMC Technologies. "Lower oil prices and greater uncertainty around operator cash flows are driving another year of customer spending reductions.” Gremp added, “We remain intensely focused on what we can control and are taking unprecedented restructuring actions across the entire company with a clear plan to lower costs, increase efficiency, and improve execution - steps that will provide sustainable savings and further strengthen our competitive position.” 

Review of Operations - Fourth Quarter 2015

Subsea Technologies

Subsea Technologies fourth quarter revenue was $1 billion, down 29 percent from the prior-year quarter. After excluding the $134.4 million of negative impact due to the strong U.S. dollar, total revenue was down 20 percent quarter-over-quarter.

Subsea Technologies operating profit decreased 49 percent from the prior-year quarter to $107.3 million. Operating results include restructuring and other severance and impairment charges of $24.5 million and a $15.3 million negative impact related to the strong U.S. dollar. Total operating profit for the quarter, excluding charges and foreign currency impacts, was down approximately 29 percent quarter-over-quarter primarily due to the decline in revenues, reduced well intervention activity in the North Sea, and higher research and development expense.

Subsea Technologies operating margins were 12.9 percent, excluding the restructuring and other severance and impairment charges.

Subsea Technologies inbound orders for the fourth quarter were $490 million and included the recently announced award for the Woodside Greater Western Flank Phase 2 Project. Backlog was $3.8 billion.

Surface Technologies

Surface Technologies fourth quarter revenue was $317 million, down 46 percent from the prior-year quarter primarily as a result of a 52 percent decline in the North American rig count.

Surface Technologies reported an operating loss of $7.3 million, which includes restructuring and other severance and impairment charges of $3.1 million. The segment results also include a $36.3 million charge for inventory write-downs primarily related to our North American businesses. Excluding these charges, adjusted operating results were down 72 percent from the prior-year quarter primarily driven by the severe North American activity decline and less favorable pricing.

Surface Technologies operating margins were 10.1 percent, excluding inventory write-downs, restructuring and other severance, and impairment charges.

Surface Technologies inbound orders for the fourth quarter were $259.2 million. Backlog was $432.8 million.

Energy Infrastructure

Energy Infrastructure fourth quarter revenue was $96 million, down 30 percent from the prior-year quarter. The revenue decline was primarily due to the steep activity decline in the North American land market, severely impacting our measurement solutions business.

Energy Infrastructure reported an operating loss of $3 million, which includes restructuring and other severance charges of $3.8 million. The segment results also include a $5.7 million charge for an inventory write-down related to our measurement solutions business.

Energy Infrastructure operating margins were 6.8 percent, excluding restructuring and other severance and inventory write-down charges.

Energy Infrastructure inbound orders for the fourth quarter were $89 million and backlog was $163.9 million.

Corporate Items

Corporate expense in the fourth quarter was $15.2 million, a decrease of $3.3 million from the prior-year quarter. Other revenue and other expense, net, improved $23.9 million from the prior-year quarter to $23 million of expense, primarily due to the absence of a $24.9 million charge incurred in the prior-year quarter related to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan.

The Company ended the quarter with net debt of $239.8 million, down $426.8 million from the prior year, due to strong operating cash flow. Net interest expense was $7.9 million in the quarter.

The Company repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $31.23 per share in the quarter. This brings total shares repurchased for the year to approximately 5.3 million shares of common stock at an average cost of $36.25 per share.

Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter was $69.1 million and capital expenditures were $39.8 million.

The Company recorded a negative effective tax rate of 8.7 percent for the fourth quarter due primarily to a favorable shift in geographic earnings mix and the reinstatement of a research and development tax credit in the quarter.
