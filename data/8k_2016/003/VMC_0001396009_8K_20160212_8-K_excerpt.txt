Compensation Decisions 

On February 11, 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Vulcan Materials Company (the "Company"), and on February 12, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company made a number of decisions regarding the compensation for each of the Company's named executive officers (the "NEOs") as follows: 

 §the Committee set the 2016 base salaries; 

 §the Committee decided, in accordance with a recommendation of the CEO (except with respect to his own compensation), to award cash bonuses based on 2015 performance; 

 §the Committee set the short-term target bonus percentages for the 2016 fiscal year; 

 §the Committee determined that payout was due on previously awarded performance shares, for the four-year performance period ended in December 31, 2015; and 

 §the Committee granted long-term incentive awards split 50/50 units between performance shares units (PSUs) and stock-only stock appreciation rights (SOSARs). The PSUs to be earned are based on the Company's four-year average total shareholder return percentile rank during the four-year performance period ending on December 31, 2019, and subject to the participant's employment at the end of such period, except as otherwise provided in the award agreement for a change in control of the Company and upon certain terminations of employment. The SOSARs will vest pro rata over four years. 

For each NEO, the following table reflects (i) the 2016 base salary effective March 1, 2016; (ii) the target bonus opportunity for the 2016 fiscal year; (iii) the cash bonus to be paid to such executive in March 2016 based on 2015 performance; and (iv) the grant of PSUs and SOSARs.
