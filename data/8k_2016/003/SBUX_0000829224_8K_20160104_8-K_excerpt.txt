Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

On January 4, 2016, the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation (the “Company”) increased the number of directors of the Company from 12 to 13 and elected Mary N. Dillon to serve as a director of the Company. Ms. Dillon was also appointed to serve on the Company’s Compensation and Management Development Committee. 

Ms. Dillon will participate in the standard compensation program for non-employee directors, including, for the director’s first year on the Board, a prorated portion, based on the month the director joined the Board, of the $260,000 annual non-employee director compensation in the form of equity awards. 

There is no arrangement or understanding pursuant to which Ms. Dillon was elected as a director, and there are no related party transactions between the Company and Ms. Dillon that would require disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

The Company also announced that Olden Lee, who will reach the director retirement age in 2016 as set forth in the Company’s Corporate Governance Principles and Practices, will retire from the Company’s Board of Directors immediately prior to the Company’s 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, at which time the number of directors of the Company will be reduced back to 12.

A copy of the press release containing the announcement of Ms. Dillon’s election is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
