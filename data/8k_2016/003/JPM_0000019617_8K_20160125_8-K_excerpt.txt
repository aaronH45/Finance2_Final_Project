 Item 8.01 Other Events.  

On January 25, 2016, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”) reached an agreement to settle two outstanding disputes with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and certain of its affiliates (“Lehman”). The settlement resolves, among other things, actions brought by Lehman seeking (i) the return of $7.9 billion in collateral and billions of dollars in consequential damages based on bankruptcy and common law causes of action and (ii) recovery of approximately $2.4 billion related to Lehman’s claims arising out of actions taken by JPMorgan Chase with respect to derivatives transactions outstanding between the two firms following Lehman’s bankruptcy. Under the settlement, the Firm will pay $1.42 billion to Lehman. The settlement is subject to Bankruptcy Court approval, and a hearing on a motion to obtain such approval is currently scheduled for February 8, 2016. The settlement will not have a material effect on JPMorgan Chase’s earnings for the first quarter of 2016.
