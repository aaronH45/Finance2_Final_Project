        "Our tax treatment and that of our stockholders may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative actions at any time, which actions may be retroactive in effect. The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by the United States Congress, the IRS and the United States Department of the Treasury, and statutory changes, new regulations, revisions to existing regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts are issued frequently. Some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as compared to other REITs due to the nature of our business and our substantial use of TRSs. Likewise, the rules regarding taxes other than United States federal income taxes may also be modified. No prediction can be made as to the likelihood of passage of new tax legislation or other provisions, or the direct or indirect effect on us and our stockholders. Revisions to tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect our ability to qualify and be taxed as a REIT, as well as the tax or other consequences of an investment in our stock. We and our stockholders may also be subject to taxation by state, local or other jurisdictions, including those in which we or our stockholders transact business or reside. These tax consequences may not be comparable to the United States federal income tax consequences described above."
