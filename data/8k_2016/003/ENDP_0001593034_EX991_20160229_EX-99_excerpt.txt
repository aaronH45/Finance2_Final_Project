U.S. BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS

U.S. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICALS

Fourth quarter 2015 U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals results include:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Compared to previous 2015 expectations, fourth quarter revenues in U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals were unfavorably impacted by increased pricing pressure due to increased competition across pain and commoditized products within legacy Qualitest and certain non-recurring charges.

INTERNATIONAL PHARMACEUTICALS

As part of Endo's planned expansion of its International Pharmaceuticals business unit and to further diversify the Company's financial profile, the Company recently closed two strategic transactions designed to increase focus on core pharmaceuticals within its Litha Group. This included the acquisition of a broad product and R&D portfolio from the Aspen Group, which closed in October 2015, and the strategic divestiture of a portfolio of non-core products, which closed in February 2016.

2016 Financial Guidance

For the full twelve months ended December 31, 2016, at current exchange rates, Endo is providing revenue guidance and updating its adjusted diluted EPS guidance from continuing operations. The Company estimates:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Cash flow from operations is expected to support the Company’s stated goal of de-levering to 3 to 4 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2016.

The Company’s 2016 financial guidance is based on the following assumptions:

•Adjusted gross margin of approximately 63% to 65%; 

•Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues to be approximately 19.5% to 20.5%; 

•Adjusted interest expense of approximately $455 million; [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

3

•Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations assume full year adjusted diluted shares outstanding of approximately 224 million shares.

Other Updates

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $272.3 million in unrestricted cash; net debt of $8.3 billion and a net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.37.

During the fourth quarter 2015, the Company recorded the following non-cash impairment charges:

•$85.8 million related to Paladin goodwill driven by the loss of exclusivity of certain products;

•$38.4 million related to legacy Qualitest products as part of the continued portfolio optimization process with the integration of Par Pharmaceutical; and

•$12.5 million, net primarily related to the abandonment of STENDRA®.

During the fourth quarter 2015, the Company recorded an $834.0 million aggregate pre-tax charge to increase its estimated product liability accrual for vaginal mesh cases. This product liability accrual increase includes $401 million attributable to removing the reduction factor assumption previously included in the Company’s estimates based on the actual number of claims processed and the lack of any meaningful reduction factor observed to date. The accrual increase also includes $433 million primarily related to the execution of additional Master Settlement Agreements in 2016. During the fourth quarter 2015, the Company recorded a $997 million tax benefit predominantly relating to a worthless stock deduction directly attributable to product liability losses. This tax benefit includes $297 million recorded in discontinued operations and $700 million in continuing operations. The Company anticipates that it will receive a federal income tax refund in 2016 from carrying back losses incurred in 2015 and expects additional benefits from reduced federal income taxes in 2016 and future years. 

In November 2015, Endo entered into a program to repurchase up to $250 million of its common stock under a previously authorized $2.5 billion repurchase plan. The purchase of $250 million of common stock was completed by December 31, 2015. In December 2015, the Company redeemed all $400 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding 7.00% Senior Notes due 2020. 

In 2015, the Company divested its AMS Men’s Health business and launched a strategic process for AMS Women’s Health - now ASTORA Women’s Health. While that process resulted in formal bids for ASTORA, Endo determined in the first quarter 2016 that it will wind down ASTORA business operations in order to reduce the potential for product liability related to future mesh implants. Endo will conduct a wind down process and work efficiently to support physicians in transitioning to alternative products. The Company will cease business operations for ASTORA by March 31, 2016.

Non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share amounts are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted earnings per share amounts. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, we stress that these are Non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, Non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. These Non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. See Endo's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished today to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an explanation of Endo's reasons for using non-GAAP measures.

Safe Harbor Statement

This press release contains forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the statements by Mr. De Silva and other statements regarding product development, market potential, expected growth and regulatory approvals, as well as Endo’s earnings per share amounts, product net sales, revenue forecasts and any other statements that refer to Endo’s expected, estimated or anticipated future results. Because forecasts are inherently estimates that cannot be made with precision, Endo’s performance at times differs materially from its estimates and targets, and Endo often does not know what the actual results will be until after the end of the applicable reporting period. Therefore, Endo will not report or comment on its progress during a current quarter except through public announcement. Any statement made by others with respect to progress during a current quarter cannot be attributed to Endo.

All forward-looking statements in this press release reflect Endo’s current analysis of existing trends and information and represent Endo’s judgment only as of the date of this press release. Actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting Endo’s businesses, including, among other things, the following: changing competitive, market and regulatory conditions; Endo’s ability to obtain and maintain adequate protection for its intellectual property rights; the timing and uncertainty of the results of both the research and development and regulatory processes; domestic and foreign health care and cost containment reforms, including government pricing, tax and reimbursement policies; technological advances and patents obtained by competitors; the performance, including the approval, introduction, and consumer and physician acceptance of new products and the continuing acceptance of currently marketed products; the effectiveness of advertising and other promotional campaigns; the timely and successful implementation of strategic initiatives; the results of any pending or future litigation, investigations or claims; the uncertainty associated with the identification of and successful consummation and execution of external corporate development initiatives and strategic partnering transactions; and Endo’s ability to obtain and successfully maintain a sufficient supply of products to meet market demand in a timely manner. In addition, U.S. and international economic conditions, including higher unemployment, political instability, financial hardship, consumer confidence and debt levels, taxation, changes in interest and currency exchange rates, international relations, capital and credit availability, the status of financial markets and institutions, fluctuations or devaluations in the value of sovereign government debt, as well as the general impact of continued economic volatility, can materially affect Endo’s results. Therefore, the reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Endo expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required to do so by law.
