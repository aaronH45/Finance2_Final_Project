ANADARKO ANNOUNCES 2015 FOURTH-QUARTER 

AND FULL-YEAR RESULTS

EXPECTS TO REDUCE 2016 CAPITAL PROGRAM BY NEARLY 50 PERCENT

HOUSTON, Feb. 1, 2016 - Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: APC) today announced 2015 fourth-quarter results, reporting a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $1.250 billion, or $2.45 per share (diluted). These results include certain items typically excluded by the investment community in published estimates. In total, these items increased the net loss by $954 million, or $1.88 per share (diluted), on an after-tax basis.(1) Cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $257 million, and discretionary cash flow totaled $810 million.(2) 

For the year ended Dec. 31, 2015, Anadarko reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $6.692 billion, or $13.18 per share (diluted). Full-year 2015 net cash used in operating activities was $1.877 billion. Discretionary cash flow for the year totaled $4.657 billion.(2) 

2015 HIGHLIGHTS

•Reduced year-over-year capital expenditures by almost 40 percent, while delivering 4-percent divestiture-adjusted(3) sales-volume growth over 2014

•Achieved an organic reserve-replacement ratio of more than 130 percent before the effects of price revisions

•Closed $2.0 billion of monetizations

“As discussed last year at this time, we did not expect oil prices to recover in 2015 and believed it could take well into 2016 before markets would stabilize on a sustained basis, costs would become more aligned with the new operating environment and investments in short-cycle assets would be more attractive. Therefore, value enhancement drove our capital-allocation philosophy,” said Anadarko Chairman, President and CEO Al Walker. “As a result, we reduced our year-over-year spending in 2015 by more than $3 billion, down nearly 40 percent from the previous year, with the largest portion of this reduction coming from our short-cycle opportunities. Through the hard work and innovation of our 

2

employees, we exceeded our initial expectations on nearly every operating metric. We dramatically improved efficiencies and reduced controllable spending by approximately $500 million, while enhancing our base production, and delivering an incremental 25,000 barrels per day of higher-margin oil sales volumes. In addition, we closed $2 billion of monetizations, significantly in excess of our initial expectations. 

“As we consider capital allocation for 2016, greater market dislocation appears likely, and the need to again materially lower our capital spending, while continuing to pursue value creation and preservation, is our best course of action,” added Walker. “In light of this, we anticipate recommending to our Board an initial 2016 budget of approximately $2.8 billion, which would be nearly 50 percent lower than our actual 2015 capital investments and almost 70 percent lower than 2014. On March 1, we will host an investor conference call and look forward to going into greater detail at that time about our definitive 2016 capital plans and expectations.

“We believe the accomplishments achieved in 2015, coupled with the steps we are taking in 2016 to materially reduce our capital spending, leverage our competitive advantages and protect our balance sheet, will serve our shareholders well. These actions should enable us to successfully manage through the current market volatility and position Anadarko for future success.”

SALES VOLUMES AND PROVED RESERVES

Anadarko’s full-year sales volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) totaled 305 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), or an average of 836,000 BOE per day. Fourth-quarter 2015 sales volumes of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs averaged approximately 779,000 BOE per day.

Anadarko organically added 407 million BOE of proved reserves in 2015 before the effects of price revisions and incurred oil and natural gas exploration and development costs of approximately $5.8 billion.(2) The company estimates its proved reserves at year-end 2015 totaled approximately 2.06 billion BOE, with nearly 80 percent of its reserves categorized as proved developed. At year-end 2015, Anadarko’s proved reserves were comprised of 52 percent liquids and 48 percent natural gas.

OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

In 2015, Anadarko increased its percentage of capital investments in longer cash cycle opportunities, such as advancing its large-scale deepwater projects and exploration. The company’s U.S. onshore investments were primarily allocated toward the Wattenberg field in northeastern Colorado and the Delaware Basin in West Texas, both of which demonstrated strong growth year over year. In the Wattenberg field, relative to 2014, Anadarko reduced drilling costs per foot by 50 percent and 

3

completion costs by 32 percent, while increasing oil sales volumes almost 30 percent. Anadarko also continued to successfully delineate its top-tier 600,000-gross-acre position with multiple stacked play opportunities in the Delaware Basin. With estimated ultimate recoveries (EURs) already approaching 1 million BOE per well in the Wolfcamp Shale, encouraging results from the Second Bone Spring formation, improved efficiencies, cost reductions, and expanded midstream infrastructure, the company expects to increase its identified drilling locations and recoverable-resource estimates in the basin beyond the current estimates of more than 1 billion BOE as the program continues to advance.

Anadarko also continued to demonstrate its industry-leading project management expertise as its Lucius development in the Gulf of Mexico achieved first oil on budget and on schedule in January 2015. Subsequent to year-end, the Anadarko-operated Heidelberg spar successfully achieved first oil with excellent safety performance, three months ahead of schedule and under budget. 

During 2015, Anadarko made significant progress advancing its Mozambique LNG project. Milestones included the signing of a Unitization and Unit Operating agreement with Eni for the development of the natural gas resources that straddle Offshore Area 1 and Offshore Area 4, signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Mozambique to provide natural gas from the development for domestic use, selecting a contractor for the initial onshore development, and progressing more than 8 million tonnes per annum of LNG offtake to long-term sales contracts. Offshore Ghana, the third-party operated TEN development was more than 80-percent complete at year-end and on track to achieve first oil in the third quarter of 2016.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Anadarko ended 2015 with $939 million of cash on hand, which reflects remittance of the $5.2 billion final payment resolving the Tronox Adversary Proceeding. In December, the company extended the maturity of its $3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to January 2021, and in January 2016, Anadarko renewed its $2 billion 364-day credit facility to a new maturity in 2017, further supporting the company’s strong liquidity position.

During the year, the company generated approximately $4.7 billion of discretionary cash flow(2) and $2.0 billion from monetizations, which more than covered its capital investments of approximately $5.9 billion, including approximately $525 million of capital investments by its subsidiary Western Gas Partners, LP (NYSE: WES).

Below are reconciliations of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (GAAP) to adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP), cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) to discretionary cash flow from operations (non-GAAP), as well as free cash flow (non-GAAP) as required under Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures

Management uses discretionary cash flow from operations because it is useful in comparisons of oil and gas exploration and production companies as it excludes certain fluctuations in assets and liabilities and current taxes related to certain items affecting comparability. Management uses free cash flow to demonstrate the Company’s ability to internally fund capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt.

Management uses net debt as a measure of the Company’s outstanding debt obligations that would not be readily satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand.
