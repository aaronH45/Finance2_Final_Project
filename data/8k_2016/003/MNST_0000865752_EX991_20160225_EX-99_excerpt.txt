2015 Fourth Quarter 

Gross sales for the 2015 fourth quarter increased 6.7 percent to $743.2 million from $696.3 million in the same period last year. Net sales for the 2015 fourth quarter increased 6.6 percent to $645.4 million from $605.6 million in the same period last year. Unfavorable currency exchange rates had the effect of reducing gross sales by approximately $23.1 million and net sales by approximately $19.7 million in the 2015 fourth quarter. 

Gross and net sales for the three-months ended December 31, 2015 were negatively impacted by advance purchases made by customers due to a pre-announced price increase effective August 31, 2015 on certain Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. The Company estimates that the advance purchases reduced gross and net sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 by approximately $12.0 million and $11.0 million, respectively. Gross and net sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 were also impacted by destocking in certain EMEA countries.

Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: “Earlier this week, we reported on the acquisition of our principal flavor supplier, American Fruits and Flavors. The transaction secures our ownership of the unique intellectual property of many of our key flavors. We have known and worked with American Fruits and Flavors as a valued supplier for more than 20 years. 

“We are pleased to note continued progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers internationally. We have launched distribution of our Monster Energy® drinks with Coca-Cola bottlers in Korea, Portugal, Russia, Spain and a number of other markets in the past few months and are making good progress thus far. We are also pleased to report that we have reached agreement with a number of other international Coca-Cola bottlers for distribution of the Monster Energy® brand. In the United States, we are seeing improvement in distribution in All Measured Channels and have expanded the number of outlets in which Monster Energy® drinks are available. 

“Distributor transitions and uncertainties in portions of our international non-Coca-Cola distribution network limited further revenue growth during the quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates also continued to adversely affect our results,” Sacks added.

The timing of the repurchases or a “modified Dutch auction” tender offer will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and the repurchase may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Measures 

Gross sales is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers. 

Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain statements made in this announcement may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws, as amended, regarding the expectations of management with respect to our future operating results and other future events including revenues and profitability.

Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: our ability to recognize benefits from The Coca-Cola Company transactions; our ability to close the acquisition and integrate American Fruits and Flavors; our ability to implement the share repurchase program; unanticipated litigation concerning the Company’s products; the current uncertainty and volatility in the national and global economy; changes in consumer preferences; changes in demand due to both domestic and international economic conditions; activities and strategies of competitors, including the introduction of new products and competitive pricing and/or marketing of similar products; actual performance of the parties under the new distribution agreements; potential disruptions arising out of the transition of certain territories to new distributors; changes in sales levels by existing distributors; unanticipated costs incurred in connection with the termination of existing distribution agreements or the transition to new distributors; changes in the price and/or availability of raw materials; other supply issues, including the availability of products and/or suitable production facilities; product distribution and placement decisions by retailers; changes in governmental regulation; the imposition of new and/or increased excise and/or sales or other taxes on our products; criticism of energy drinks and/or the energy drink market generally; our ability to satisfy all criteria set forth in any U.S. model energy drink guidelines; the impact of proposals to limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age and/or restrict the venues and/or the size of

1Gross sales is a non-GAAP measure that is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers. 

2Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to the Company’s distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts 

granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to the Company’s distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) the Company’s agreed share of fees given to distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (v) incentives given to the Company’s distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to the Company’s distributors related to sales made by the Company direct to certain customers that fall within the distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) commissions paid to our customers. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. The Company’s promotional allowance programs with its numerous distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. 

3Excludes $39.8 million for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2015, related to the acceleration of deferred revenue associated with certain of the Company’s prior distributors who were sent notices of termination during the first quarter of 2015.

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information

Adjusted results are non-GAAP items that exclude (i) the acceleration of deferred revenue, (ii) distributor termination costs, (iii) TCCC Transaction expenses, and (iv) the gain on sale of the non-energy business. The Company believes that these non-GAAP items are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating and financial results. The non-GAAP items should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, U.S. GAAP financial measures.
