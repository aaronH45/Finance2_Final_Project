Section 2 - FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On February 2, 2016, Gilead Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Gilead), issued a press release announcing its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. 

Gilead has presented certain financial information in accordance with U.S. general accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and also on a non-GAAP basis for the fourth quarter and full year of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Management believes this non-GAAP information is useful for investors, when considered in conjunction with Gilead's GAAP financial statements, because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of Gilead's operating results as reported under GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided in the table on pages 8 and 9 of the press release filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.

The information in this Form 8-K and the exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
