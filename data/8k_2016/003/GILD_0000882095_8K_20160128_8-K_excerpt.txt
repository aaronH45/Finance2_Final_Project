On January 28, 2016, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board set the base salaries for the 2016 fiscal year for the Company’s named executive officers from the proxy statement filed in connection with the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders (the Executive Officers). The Committee also determined their bonus awards for the completed 2015 fiscal year based on their individual performance and the Company’s attained level of certain financial and non-financial objectives established for that year. The independent members of the Board ratified the 2015 bonus and 2016 base salary of John C. Martin, Ph.D., the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The 2015 bonuses and 2016 base salaries approved for the Executive Officers are as follows:

In connection with Dr. Martin’s appointment to Executive Chairman, his 2016 target bonus opportunity (as a percent of base salary) decreased from 155% to 100%, with the actual amount of his bonus for such year to be based solely on the Company’s performance.  

In connection with Dr. Milligan’s promotion, his 2016 target bonus opportunity (as a percent of base salary) increased from 100% to 150%, with the actual amount of his bonus for such year to be based solely on the Company’s performance.

 * The value of awards actually granted may differ due to rounding.  

The number of shares actually granted are based on the fair value on the February 1, 2016 effective date. The independent members of the Board ratified the equity grants to Dr. Martin and Dr. Milligan. The options will be granted under the Company’s 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the Plan), and will have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on February 1, 2016. The options will have a maximum term of ten years measured from such effective date.

The TSR and revenue tranches of each award will be structured in substantially the same manner as the 2015 performance shares awards.
