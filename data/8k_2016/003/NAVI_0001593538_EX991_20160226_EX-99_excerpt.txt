 Forward-Looking Statements; Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following information is current as of February 26, 2016 (unless otherwise noted) and should be read in connection with Navient Corporation’s ("Navient”) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the “2015 Form 10-K”), filed by Navient with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 25, 2016 and subsequent reports filed by Navient with the SEC. Definitions for capitalized terms in this presentation not defined herein can be found in our 2015 Form 10-K. This presentation contains “forward-looking” statements and other information that is based on management’s current expectations as of the date of this report. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs, opinions, or expectations and statements that assume or are dependent upon future events, are forward-looking statements and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “would,” or “target.” Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from those reflected in such forward-looking statements. For us, these factors include, among others, the risks and uncertainties associated with: • increases in financing costs; • limits on liquidity; • increases in costs associated with compliance with laws and regulations; • changes in accounting standards and the impact of related changes in significant accounting estimates; • any adverse outcomes in any significant litigation to which we are a party; • credit risk associated with our exposure to third parties, including counterparties to our derivative transactions; and • changes in the terms of education loans and the educational credit marketplace (including changes resulting from new laws and the implementation of existing laws). We could also be affected by, among other things: • changes in our funding costs and the availability of that funding; • reductions to our credit ratings or the credit ratings of the United States of America; • failures of our operating systems or infrastructure, or those of third-party vendors; • risks related to cybersecurity including the potential disruption of our systems or potential disclosure of confidential customer information; • damage to our reputation; • failures to successfully implement cost-cutting initiatives and adverse effects of such initiatives on our business; • failures or errors in the conversion to our servicing platform of the Wells Fargo portfolio of Federal Family Education Loan Program (“FFELP”) loans or failures, delays or errors in the conversion to our servicing platform of any other FFELP or Private Education Loan portfolio acquisitions; • risks associated with restructuring initiatives; • changes in law and regulations with respect to the student lending business and financial institutions generally; • increased competition from banks and other consumer lenders; • the creditworthiness of our customers; • changes in the general interest rate environment, including the rate relationships among relevant money-market instruments and those of our earning assets versus our funding arrangements; • our ability to successfully effectuate any acquisitions and other strategic initiatives; • changes in the demand for debt management services; • changes in general economic conditions; and • the other factors that are described in the “Risk Factors” section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our future reports filed with the SEC. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements also requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions including estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates or assumptions may prove to be incorrect and actual results could differ materially. All forward-looking statements contained in this presentation are qualified by these cautionary statements and are made only as of the date of this document. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements except as required by law. Navient reports financial results on a GAAP basis and also provides certain core earnings performance measures. When compared to GAAP results, core earnings exclude the impact of: (1) the financial results of the consumer banking business for historical periods prior to the April 30, 2014 spin-off as well as related restructuring and reorganization expenses incurred in connection with the spin-off, including the restructuring initiated in the second quarter of 2015; (2) unrealized, mark-to-market gains/losses on derivatives; and (3) goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization and impairment. Navient provides core earnings measures because this is what management uses when making management decisions regarding Navient’s performance and the allocation of corporate resources. Navient core earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional information, see “Core Earnings — Definition and Limitations” in Navient’s fourth quarter earnings release for a further discussion and a complete reconciliation between GAAP net income and core earnings.

 Navient’s Default Prevention Expertise Was a Key Factor in the Decline of the National Default Rate 2012 Three-Year Cohort Default Rate Default Rate (%) The cohort default rate (CDR) measures the percent of borrowers who defaulted on a student loan within three years of entering repayment. In 2015, the Department of Education announced the 2012 three-year CDR fell from 13.7% to 11.8%. The three-year CDR for Navient-serviced customers was 8.0%, 38% lower than the national rate excluding Navient-serviced borrowers. Navient serviced 22% of all federal borrowers entering repayment in the 2012 cohort period, meaning Navient’s performance had a significant impact on the overall cohort default rate. Source: Department of Education Cohort Default Rate released Sept. 29, 2015, http://www2.ed.gov/offices/OSFAP/defaultmanagement/cdr.html and company data. The 2012 Cohort Default Rate analyzes data from the group of borrowers who entered repayment between Oct. 1, 2011, and Sept. 30, 2012, and who defaulted in a three-year window by fall of 2014. To isolate the difference in defaults between Navient borrowers and others, the difference is calculated by removing Navient’s marketshare from the overall national cohort default rate.

 Cohort Default Triangles The following cohort default triangles provide loan performance information for certain Private Education Loans of Navient Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries that meet such subsidiaries’ securitization criteria (including those criteria listed below): Program types include Undergraduate/Graduate(1), Direct-to-Consumer (“DTC”)(2), Career Training(3) and Private Consolidation Loans FICO scores are based on the greater of the borrower and cosigner scores as of a date near the loan application and must be at least 640 The cohort default triangles are not representative of the characteristics of the portfolio of Private Education Loans of Navient Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole or any particular securitization trust Undergraduate/Graduate loans marketed under the Signature Student Loan brand. Direct-to-Consumer Loans marketed under the Tuition Answer brand. Career Training loans provide eligible borrowers financing at technical, trade, K-12 or tutoring schools. 

 Cohort Default Triangles The cohort default triangles featured on subsequent slides are segmented by loan program type, FICO score, cosigner status, and school type Terms and calculations used in the cohort default triangles are defined below: Repayment Year – The calendar year loans entered repayment Disbursed Principal Entering Repayment – The amount of principal entering repayment in a given year, based on disbursed principal prior to any interest capitalization Years in Repayment – Measured in years between repayment start date and default date. Zero represents defaults that occurred prior to the start of repayment. Periodic Defaults – Defaulted principal in each Year in Repayment as a percentage of the disbursed principal entering repayment in each Repayment Year Defaulted principal includes any interest capitalization that occurred prior to default Defaulted principal is not reduced by any amounts recovered after the loan defaulted Because the numerator includes capitalized interest while the denominator does not, default rates are higher than if the numerator and denominator both included capitalized interest Total – The sum of Periodic Defaults across Years in Repayment for each Repayment Year
