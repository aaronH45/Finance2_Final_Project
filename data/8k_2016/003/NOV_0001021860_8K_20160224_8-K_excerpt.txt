The Stock Options were granted at a price equal to the closing trading price of the Company’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on February 24, 2016 ($28.24 per share). Each of such options has a term of 10 years and vests in three equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant. If an employee dies while in the employ of the Company, the employee’s estate may exercise the vested options at any time within 10 years from the date of grant.  

The Restricted Stock Awards granted by the Company shall vest in three equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant, provided that such executive officer remains continuously employed with the Company during such time period.  

The Performance Awards can be earned by the executives only if the percentile ranking of the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TRS”) as measured against the TSR of the constituent members of the OSX Index over a three-year performance period, exceeds certain levels. The following table summarizes the payout levels on the TSR Award based on the relative performance of the Company’s TSR:
