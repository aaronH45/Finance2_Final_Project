Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On February 16, 2016, Qorvo, Inc. (“Qorvo”) entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (the “ASR Agreements”) with Bank of America, N.A. (“BofA”) to repurchase $500 million of Qorvo’s common stock, $250 million of which will be subject to a maximum and minimum share price. The ASR Agreements are part of Qorvo’s previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program approved by its Board of Directors in November 2015. Under the ASR Agreements, Qorvo made a $500 million payment to BofA and received an initial delivery of approximately 8.0 million shares of Qorvo’s common stock from BofA. The final number of shares Qorvo will repurchase under the ASR Agreements will be based generally on the volume-weighted average price of Qorvo’s common stock during a repurchase period, subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreements. At settlement, under certain circumstances, Qorvo may be required to deliver shares of its common stock to BofA or, at Qorvo’s election, make a cash payment to BofA. The final settlement of the transactions under the ASR Agreements is expected to be completed in the first quarter of Qorvo’s fiscal year 2017. After giving effect to the ASR Agreements, approximately $250 million will remain authorized under Qorvo’s repurchase program for future repurchases.
