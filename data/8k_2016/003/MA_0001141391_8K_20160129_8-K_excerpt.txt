Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On January 29, 2016, MasterCard Incorporated (“MasterCard”) issued a press release announcing financial results for its fourth quarter and full year 2015.

A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. All information in the press release is furnished but not filed.

Non-GAAP Financial Information

In the attached press release, MasterCard discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures:

•During the full year ended December 31, 2015, total operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per diluted share (as well as related applicable growth rates), and operating margin, each presented on a pro forma basis giving effect to the exclusion of both a settlement charge relating to the termination of our qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plan (the “U.S. Employee Pension Plan Settlement Charge”) and a charge related to a U.K. merchant litigation settlement (the “U.K. Merchant Litigation Settlement Provision”) recorded during the full-year period. 

•During the full year ended December 31, 2015, effective tax rate presented on a pro forma basis giving effect to the exclusion of income tax benefits associated with the after-tax charge related to both the U.S. Employee Pension Plan Settlement Charge and the U.K. Merchant Litigation Settlement Provision. 

MasterCard excludes the U.S. Employee Pension Plan Settlement Charge and the U.K. Merchant Litigation Settlement Provision because its management monitors significant one-time items separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts. MasterCard’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of MasterCard’s operating performance and meaningful comparison of its results between periods.

In the attached press release, management also presents growth rates adjusted for currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Due to the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on reported results, MasterCard’s management believes the presentation on certain growth rates adjusted for currency, calculated by re-measuring the prior period's results using the current period's exchange rates, provides relevant information. 

MasterCard’s management uses non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. The attached press release includes reconciliations of the requisite non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure

On January 29, 2016, MasterCard will host a conference call to discuss its fourth-quarter and full year 2015 financial results. A copy of the presentation to be used during the conference call is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. All information in the presentation is furnished but not filed.

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
