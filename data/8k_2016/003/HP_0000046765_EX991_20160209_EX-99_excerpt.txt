U.S. Land Drilling Market Conditions Oil and gas prices remain low, forcing E&P companies to further reduce drilling budgets U.S. land active rig count is now at levels not seen since 1999 (<600) Market is not expected to improve in the first calendar quarter of 2016 Industry is experiencing dramatic reductions in personnel and investments AC drive market share continues to increase (now at 64%)

Drilling Activity in the U.S. 

H&P’s U.S. Land Activity and Pricing Comments H&P’s U.S. Land segment had approximately 121 contracted rigs generating revenue as of January 28, 2016, down from 127 on January 6, 2016. Average FlexRig spot pricing is down by more than 30%, as compared to spot pricing at the peak in November 2014, and it may continue to decline. Since the start of the downturn in late-2014 through January 28, 2016, H&P’s U.S. Land segment had received early termination notices for 77 rigs working under long-term contracts, up 17 from 60 at November 12, 2015. (As of January 28, 2016)

H&P Global Fleet Under Term Contract Strong Backlog The above term contract coverage excludes long-term contracts for which the Company received early contract termination notifications as of 1/28/16. Given notifications as of 1/28/16, the Company expects to generate over $78 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2016, approximately $77 million during the remaining two quarters of fiscal 2016, and over $40 million thereafter from early terminations corresponding to long-term contracts. All of the above rig contracts include provisions for early termination fees. Some of the new build deliveries may be delayed in exchange for compensation from customers, but the corresponding total backlog would remain the same or potentially increase. Mutually beneficial renegotiations of some long-term contracts for active rigs are expected to extend the timing of those contracts beyond what is reflected above. *

Ongoing U.S. Land Market Trends Unconventional plays continue to shape the landscape. AC drive rigs are best suited for more complex horizontal drilling. Customers continue to focus on drilling efficiency, technology and safety. Multiple wells being drilled from a single pad. The replacement cycle is expected to continue.
