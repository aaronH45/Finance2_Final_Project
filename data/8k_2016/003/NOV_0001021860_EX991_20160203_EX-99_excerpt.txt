NATIONAL OILWELL VARCO ANNOUNCES  

FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2015 EARNINGS  

HOUSTON, TX, February 3, 2016 — National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NYSE: NOV) today reported fourth quarter 2015 net income of $85 million, or $0.23 per fully diluted share, excluding other items, down from $0.61 in the third quarter of 2015 on a comparable basis. Other items included pre-tax charges of $1,634 million for goodwill and other intangible asset write-downs, $139 million for restructuring and other charges (which included inventory write-downs, severance and facility closure costs, and other costs), and $7 million in FX losses due to a currency devaluation in Argentina. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $1,523 million, or $4.06 per fully diluted share.  

Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $2.72 billion, a decrease of 18 percent from the third quarter of 2015 and a decrease of 52 percent from the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating profit for the quarter, excluding other items, was $141 million, or 5.2 percent of revenue. EBITDA for the quarter, excluding other items, was $308 million, or 11.3 percent of revenue, down 40 percent sequentially and 75 percent from the prior year. Operating leverage, or the change in operating profit divided by the change in revenue, excluding other items, was 35 percent from the third quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2015.  

Revenues reported for the full year 2015 were $14.76 billion, and net loss was $769 million, or $1.99 per fully diluted share. Excluding other items, net income was $1,083 million for the full year 2015, or $2.80 per fully diluted share. Operating profit for the full year, excluding other items, was $1.63 billion, or 11.1 percent of revenue. Year-over-year operating leverage was 32 percent, excluding other items from both periods. EBITDA for the full year, excluding other items, was $2.28 billion, or 15.5 percent of revenue.  

Clay C. Williams, Chairman, President and CEO of National Oilwell Varco, stated, “Our team executed well in 2015 in a very tough market. Tumbling oil prices brought capital austerity and sharply lower oilfield activity, which is intensifying as we enter 2016. Nevertheless, our consolidated revenue outperformed the decline in global rig count, and our cost reductions and operational efficiencies enabled solid cash generation. Together with our strong balance sheet, this allowed us to invest in our business for future growth, as well as return significant capital to our shareholders. We are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities we expect to emerge during 2016.  

This ‘lower-for-longer’ market decline will provide the foundation for an eventual recovery, as oil depletion marches onward and demand continues to grow. We nevertheless recognize that the timing of the recovery remains uncertain and that we face additional headwinds in the year ahead. I am grateful for the hard work and dedication of our NOV employees and am confident in their ability to navigate the tough road ahead. We remain resolute in our focus on reducing costs, improving execution, doing more with less and, ultimately, emerging from the depths of this cycle well positioned for the upturn.”

Note 1: In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose, as appropriate, various non-GAAP financial measures in our quarterly earnings press releases and other public disclosures. The primary non-GAAP financial measures we focus on, when applicable, are: (i) revenue excluding other items, (ii) operating profit excluding other items, (iii) operating profit percentage excluding other items, (iv) operating profit excluding other items before depreciation & amortization, (v) operating profit percentage excluding other items before depreciation & amortization, (vi) EBITDA, (vii) EBITDA excluding other items, (viii) Operating (non-GAAP) per fully diluted share and (ix) Operating (non-GAAP) excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets per fully diluted share. Each of these financial measures excludes the impact of certain items and therefore has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure is included here within.  

We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate and manage the Company’s operations because we believe it provides useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s on-going economic performance. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform more meaningful comparisons of operating results and as a means to emphasize the results of on-going operations.
