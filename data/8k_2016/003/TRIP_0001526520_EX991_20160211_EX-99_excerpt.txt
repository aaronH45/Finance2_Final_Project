Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in GAAP in our press release and related conference call or webcast, we also report certain non-GAAP financial measures. A “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in such company’s financial statements. We use the following non-GAAP measures: non-GAAP selling and marketing expense, non-GAAP technology and content expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted shares, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, non-GAAP revenue before effects of foreign exchange, non-GAAP click-based advertising revenue before effects of foreign exchange, non-GAAP hotel segment revenue before effects of foreign exchange, and Adjusted EBITDA before effects of foreign exchange.  

The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered measures of TripAdvisor’s liquidity. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, many of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of certain items, as defined in our non-GAAP definitions below, which are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even where similarly titled, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes and therefore should not be used to compare TripAdvisor’s performance to that of other companies. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP financial measures.  

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. 

We define our non-GAAP financial measures as below: 

TripAdvisor defines “non-GAAP Selling and Marketing”, “non-GAAP Technology and Content” and “non-GAAP General and Administrative” expenses as GAAP Selling and Marketing, GAAP Technology and Content and GAAP General and Administrative expenses, respectively, before stock-based compensation expense and other stock-settled obligations, and other non-recurring expenses.  

TripAdvisor defines “non-GAAP net income” as GAAP net income excluding, net of their related tax effects: (1) stock-based compensation expense and other stock-settled obligations; (2) amortization of intangible assets; (3) certain gains, losses, and other expenses that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating results; (4) goodwill, long-lived assets and intangible asset impairments and (5) other non-recurring expenses. Non-GAAP net income generally captures all items on the statements of operations that occur in normal course of operations that have been, or ultimately will be, settled in cash, except for depreciation, which management believes is an ongoing cost of doing business. 

TripAdvisor defines “non-GAAP net income per diluted share” as non-GAAP net income divided by non-GAAP diluted shares. Non-GAAP diluted shares includes potential dilution from options calculated using the treasury stock method under GAAP plus weighted average shares for all outstanding RSUs.  

TripAdvisor defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as net income (loss) plus: (1) provision for income taxes; (2) other income (expense), net; (3) depreciation of property and equipment, including amortization of internal use software and website development; (4) amortization of intangible assets; (5) stock-based compensation and other stock-settled obligations; (6) goodwill, long-lived assets and intangible asset impairments; and (7) other non-recurring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary metric by which management evaluates the performance of its business and on which internal budgets and forecasts are based. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis. We believe that by excluding certain non-cash expenses, such as stock-based compensation, stock-settled obligations, asset impairments, amortization and other expense, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash that operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. 

TripAdvisor defines “Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.  

8 

TripAdvisor defines “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, which are purchases of property and equipment, including capitalization of internal-use software development costs. We believe this financial measure can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. 

TripAdvisor calculates our foreign exchange effect of revenue or, “non-GAAP revenue before effects of foreign exchange”, “non-GAAP click-based advertising revenue before effects of foreign exchange” and “non-GAAP hotel segment before effects of foreign exchange” on a constant currency basis by excluding the effects of foreign exchange on revenue by translating actual revenue for the current year three months and year ended using the prior year's quarterly average exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We believe this is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance. 

TripAdvisor calculates our foreign exchange effect of Adjusted EBITDA or, “Adjusted EBITDA before effects of foreign exchange,” on a constant currency basis, by excluding the effects of foreign exchange by translating all amounts included in Adjusted EBITDA for the current year three months and year ended using the prior year's quarterly average exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We believe this is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance. 

Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, we present reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure below.
