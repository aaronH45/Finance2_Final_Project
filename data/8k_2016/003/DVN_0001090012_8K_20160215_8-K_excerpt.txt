Item 2.05 Costs Associated With Exit or Disposal Activities  

On February 15, 2016, Devon Energy Corporation (“Devon”) initiated a workforce reduction program in response to prolonged commodity price weakness, which has resulted in a reduction of Devon’s capital programs and other operations. During February 2016, Devon will provide notices of termination to approximately 1,000 employees. Approximately 600 additional employees will be impacted when Devon’s planned U.S. asset divestitures are completed later in 2016. The workforce and other reductions are expected to decrease gross general and administrative costs by approximately $400 million to $500 million on an annual basis, exclusive of reorganization charges.  

In connection with this workforce reduction program, Devon estimates that it will incur approximately $225 million to $275 million of restructuring costs, which is comprised of the following amounts:  

   •   employee severance and termination benefits of $210 million to $250 million; and  

   •   contract termination and other office lease abandonment charges of $15 million to $25 million.  

Devon expects to recognize the majority of these restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2016 and will recognize the remaining costs throughout 2016 until the planned divestiture transactions have closed and the remaining employee terminations have occurred. Actual charges will vary if planned divestitures do not occur as projected. Devon estimates that $170 million to $200 million of the estimated total costs will result in future cash expenditures. The majority of the costs that will not result in future cash expenditures consist of employee severance costs related to accelerated vesting of employee stock awards.  

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers  

On February 16, 2016, Devon announced that Tony D. Vaughn has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Vaughn, 58, held the position of Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production since 2013. Since joining Devon in 1999, Mr. Vaughn has served in various positions, including Senior Vice President, Exploration and Strategic Services from 2003 until 2013.  

Mr. Vaughn’s son, Nick Vaughn, is employed by Devon as a procurement manager. His total 2015 taxable compensation, including salary, bonus and stock grants, was approximately $148,000, which was commensurate with the compensation provided to similarly situated employees of Devon. Mr. Vaughn was not involved in the evaluation of his son’s performance and his son’s compensation was determined in accordance with Devon’s standard human resources policies and procedures. Aside from the foregoing, there are no transactions or relationships between Devon and Mr. Vaughn that are reportable under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.  

On February 16, 2016, Devon also announced that Darryl G. Smette, Executive Vice President, Marketing, Facilities, Pipeline and Supply Chain, will retire effective on or about July 31, 2016.
