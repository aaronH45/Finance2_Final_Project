ITEM 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Changes in Fiscal Year.  

On February 29, 2016, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Range Resources Corporation (the “Company”) adopted resolutions to amend and restate the Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws (as so amended, the “By-Laws”) to implement proxy access.  

In response to a stockholder proposal submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders in May 2015, the Company’s Board adopted new provisions to allow a stockholder or group of stockholders that meet certain criteria and requirements to nominate candidates for election to the Board and have such persons included in the Company’s proxy.  

In general, as described more fully in Section 3.4 of the By-Laws, a stockholder or group of stockholders comprised of no more than 20 unaffiliated stockholders, owning at least 3% of the outstanding common stock of the Company for at least 3 years is permitted to submit a director nominee. The maximum number of nominees is 20% of the Board or 2 whichever is greater, provided the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the By-Laws. The By-Laws also included changes to the notice of stockholder nominations and other provisions to account for proxy access. 

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the By-Laws, a copy of which is included as Exhibit 3.1 to this report and incorporated by reference herein.
