        "*At December 31, 2015, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The requirements are to be applied retrospectively to prior periods presented. These changes resulted in classifying debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability (except for those related to revolving credit facilities), rather than as an asset. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, other assets, net and long-term debt are reduced by $14,380 and $16,824, respectively. The adoption of this ASU did not impact the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) or the Cash Flow Statements."
