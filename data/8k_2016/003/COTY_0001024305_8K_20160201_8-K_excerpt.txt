(“Hypermarcas”) for R$3.5 billion (approximately $886.7 million) in cash, net of working capital and net indebtedness adjustments (the “Transaction”).  

 An affiliate of Coty, JAB Cosmetics B.V. (“JAB Cosmetics”), entered into a Shares and Trademarks Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Hypermarcas, Cosmed Indústria de Cosméticos e Medicamentos S.A., and, as intervening and consenting parties, Novita Distribuição, Armazenamento e Transportes S.A., and Savoy Indústria de Cosméticos S.A., dated as of November 2, 2015, providing for the acquisition of the Beauty Business. Coty and JAB Cosmetics subsequently entered into an Assignment and Transfer Agreement, dated as of November 2, 2015 (the “Assignment Agreement”), pursuant to which JAB Cosmetics assigned all of JAB Cosmetics’ right, title and interest to, and Coty assumed all of JAB Cosmetics’ obligations under, the Purchase Agreement.  

 The summary set forth above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Assignment Agreement (including as an exhibit thereto the Purchase Agreement), a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 3, 2015 and which is incorporated herein by reference.

A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated in this report by reference.  

 The information furnished with this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
