 Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.  

On January 26, 2016, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Devon Energy Corporation (the “Company”) amended and restated the Company’s Bylaws (as amended and restated, the “Bylaws”) primarily to implement “proxy access.” A new subsection (C) has been added to Article II, Section 9 of the Bylaws to permit a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials director candidates constituting up to the greater of two individuals or 20% of the Board, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws. Although the amendment and restatement of the Bylaws was effective immediately upon the Board’s approval on January 26, 2016, proxy access will first be available to stockholders in connection with the Company’s 2017 annual meeting of stockholders.  

The Bylaws were also amended to make clarifications, updates and refinements to the advance notice and special meeting provisions of Article II, Section 9 and to add a requirement that all nominees for director provide certain information, representations and agreements to the Company in order to be eligible for election. In addition, new Section 5 of Article VII makes explicit the Board’s ability to interpret and make determinations under the Bylaws.  

This description of the amendments to the Bylaws is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is included as Exhibit 3.1 to this report and incorporated by reference herein.
