Forward-looking statements include our financial performance outlook and statements concerning our operations, economic performance, financial condition, goals, beliefs, future growth strategies, investment objectives, plans and current expectations, such as 2016 guidance, our proposed acquisition of Recall Holdings Limited (“Recall”), strategic goals, and expected cost savings associated with the Transformation initiative. These forward-looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. When we use words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates" or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Although we believe that our forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. In addition, important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, among others: (i) our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a real estate investment trust for U.S. Federal income tax purposes ("REIT"); (ii) the adoption of alternative technologies and shifts by our customers to storage of data through non-paper based technologies; (iii) changes in customer preferences and demand for our storage and information management services; (iv) the cost to comply with current and future laws, regulations and customer demands relating to privacy issues; (v) the impact of litigation or disputes that may arise in connection with incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information; (vi) changes in the price for our storage and information management services relative to the cost of providing such storage and information management services; (vii) changes in the political and economic environments in the countries in which our international subsidiaries operate; (viii) our ability or inability to complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms and to integrate acquired companies efficiently; (ix) changes in the amount of our capital expenditures; (x) changes in the cost of our debt; (xi) the impact of alternative, more attractive investments on dividends; (xii) the cost or potential liabilities associated with real estate necessary for our business; (xiii) the performance of business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management expertise outside the United States; (xiv) other trends in competitive or economic conditions affecting our financial condition or results of operations not presently contemplated; and (xv) other risks described more fully in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under the caption “Risk Factors” in our periodic reports, or incorporated therein. In addition, with respect to the potential Recall transaction, our ability to close the proposed transaction in accordance with the terms of our agreement with Recall, or at all, is dependent on our and Recall's ability to satisfy the closing conditions set forth in such agreement, including the receipt of governmental and shareholder approvals. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements except as statements of our present intentions and of our present expectations, which may or may not occur. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to release publicly the result of any revision to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Earnings Overview Iron Mountain Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Financial Results Fourth Quarter and Full Year Highlights • • • • • • • Strong financial and operating performance aligns with 2020 strategic plan and exceeds expectations. Full-year constant dollar Total Revenue in line with guidance, and Adjusted OIBDA at upper end of guidance. Transformation savings realized in fourth quarter expected to contribute $50 million of Adjusted OIBDA improvement in 2016. Constant dollar storage rental growth supported by volume gains across all major markets. Service gross margin target achieved in the fourth quarter. Annualized dividend of $1.94 per share in 2016 reflects consistent growth and solid execution of strategic plan. 2016 C$ growth in line with guidance released at Investor Day. Financial Performance • On a constant dollar (C$) basis, total revenue growth for the quarter was 2.1%, reflecting solid storage rental revenue gains of 3.2%, and service revenue growth of 0.3%. As a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, total reported revenues for the fourth quarter were $752 million in 2015, compared with $778 million in 2014. Full year total reported revenues were $3.01 billion, compared with $3.12 billion in 2014. C$ total revenue growth for the year also was 2.1%, driven by storage rental revenue gains of 4.0%, partially offset by service revenue declines of 0.7%. • Adjusted OIBDA for the fourth quarter was $238 million, compared with $220 million in 2014, while full-year Adjusted OIBDA was $920 million, compared with $926 million in 2014. Adjusted OIBDA for 2014 includes $3.5 million of restructuring costs and Adjusted OIBDA for 2015 includes previously communicated costs of $10 million related to the company’s Transformation initiative. On a C$ basis, Adjusted OIBDA increased by 13.6% for the quarter and 4.4% for the year (14.1% and 5.1%, excluding Transformation and restructuring costs for the quarter and full year, respectively). • Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.33 per diluted share, compared with $0.25 per diluted share in 2014. Full-year Adjusted EPS was $1.21 per diluted share, compared with $1.36 in 2014. Adjusted EPS for 2015 reflects an 8% increase in weighted average shares outstanding following the distribution of shares in November 2014 associated with the company’s conversion to a REIT as well as the Transformation costs noted above. Finally, Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter reflects a structural tax rate of 16.8%, compared with a structural tax rate of 14.4% in 2014. • GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.03 per share compared with GAAP EPS of $0.06 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Full-year GAAPEPS was $0.59, compared with $1.67 for 2014. 2014 GAAP EPS includes $176 million of a net discrete tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2014 primarily related to the reversal of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by incremental taxes related to foreign repatriation associated with the company’s conversion to a REIT. • FFO (Normalized) per share was $0.57 for the fourth quarter compared with $0.53 in 2014 and $2.10 for the year compared with $2.28 in 2014. • AFFO was $125 million for the fourth quarter compared with $112 million in 2014, and $522 million for the year compared with $527 million in 2014. www.ironmountain.com Selected metric definitions are available in the Appendix 4

Company Profile Iron Mountain is a global leader in enterprise storage with a high-return, real estate-based business model, yielding over $3 billion of revenues annually. The company provides storage and information management services to a high-quality, diversified customer base across numerous industries and government organizations. Iron Mountain serves more than 170,000 customers, including approximately 94% of the Fortune 1000, and no single customer accounts for more than 1% of revenues. Iron Mountain provides storage and information management services in 37 countries on five continents, storing 530 million cubic feet of records in a portfolio of approximately 1,100 facilities containing 69.9 million square feet of space. The company employs more than 20,000 people. Countries Served Iron Mountain is organized as a REIT, and its financial model is based on the recurring nature of its storage rental revenues and resulting storage net operating income (NOI). Supported by its consistent, predictable storage rental revenues, the company generates predictable, low-volatility growth in key metrics such as storage NOI and AFFO. This fundamental financial characteristic provides stability through economic cycles. Diversification of Total Revenue (As of 12/31/2015) Iron Mountain has the opportunity to invest capital at attractive returns both domestically and internationally. The company believes that there remains a large un-vended opportunity that can support sustained storage volumes in developed markets such as North America and high growth opportunities in emerging markets where customers are just beginning to outsource their storage of physical documents.

Financial Highlights (1) In 2015, we revised the reconciliation of FFO (NAREIT), FFO (Normalized) and AFFO to reconcile these Non-GAAP measures to consolidated net income, rather than net income attributable to Iron Mountain. We have revised the 2014 reconciliation of FFO (NAREIT), FFO (Normalized) and AFFO to conform to current year presentation. (2) A one-time reallocation of service costs to storage in Q3 2015 enhanced FY 2015 Service Gross Margin by 50 basis points. Normalized for this reallocation adjustment, 2015 service gross margin would have been 26.1%. www.ironmountain.com Selected metric definitions are available in the Appendix 8 Storage Rental $465,401 $457,764 (1.6)% $1,860,243 $1,837,897 (1.2)% Service 312,577 294,663 (5.7)% 1,257,450 1,170,079 (6.9)% Total Re ve nue s $777,978 $752,427 (3.3)% $3,117,693 $3,007,976 (3.5)% Gross Prof it $440,954 $428,001 (2.9)% $1,773,057 $1,717,951 (3.1)% Gross Margin % 56.7% 56.9% 20 bps 56.9% 57.1% 20 bps Adjusted OIBDA $220,033 $237,725 8.0% $925,797 $920,005 (0.6)% Adjusted OIBDA % 28.3% 31.6% 330 bps 29.7% 30.6% 90 bps Adjusted EPS $0.25 $0.33 31.2% $1.36 $1.21 (11.0)% FFO (NAREIT)(1) $58,991 $50,286 (14.8)% $504,609 $303,153 (39.9)% FFO (Normalized)(1) $107,980 $119,923 11.1% $449,228 $446,244 (0.7)% FFO (Normalized) per Share(1) $0.53 $0.57 7.5% $2.28 $2.10 (7.7)% AFFO(1) $112,207 $124,965 11.4% $527,460 $522,207 (1.0)% Ordinary Dividends per Share $0.475 $0.485 2.1% $1.900 $1.910 0.5% Weighted Average Fully-diluted Shares Outstanding 205,494 212,231 3.3% 196,749 212,118 7.8% Storage Net Operating Income (NOI) $381,878 $375,376 (1.7)% $1,514,999 $1,496,156 (1.2)% Storage Profit and M argin Storage Gross Prof it $355,612 $347,882 (2.2%) $1,424,981 $1,406,990 (1.3%) Storage Gross Margin 76.4% 76.0% -40 bps 76.6% 76.6% 0 bps Se rvice Profit and M argin Service Gross Prof it $85,341 $80,120 (6.1%) $348,075 $310,961 (10.7%) Service Gross Margin(2) 27.3% 27.2% -10 bps 27.7% 26.6% -110 bps % Change Full Ye ar 2015 Full Ye ar 2014 % Change Q4 2015 Q4 2014

Appendix Non-GAAP Measures Non-GAAP measures are supplemental metrics designed to enhance our disclosure and to provide additional information that we believe to be important for investors to consider when evaluating our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America (“GAAP”), such as operating or net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Adjusted Earnings Per Share, or Adjusted EPS Adjusted EPS is defined as reported earnings per share from continuing operations excluding: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) (gain) on sale of real estate, net of tax; (3) intangible impairments; (4) Recall Costs (as defined below); (5) REIT Costs; (6) other expense (income), net; and (7) the tax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items. We do not believe these excluded items to be indicative of our ongoing operating results, and they are not considered when we are forecasting our future results. We believe Adjusted EPS is of value to our current and potential investors when comparing our results from past, present and future periods. Adjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO AFFO is defined as FFO (Normalized) excluding non-cash rent expense or income, plus depreciation on non-real estate assets, amortization expense (including amortization of deferred financing costs) and non-cash equity compensation expense, less maintenance capital expenditures and non-real estate investments. We believe AFFO is a useful measure in determining our ability to generate excess cash that may be used for reinvestment in the business, discretionary deployment in investments such as real estate or acquisition opportunities, returning of capital to our stockholders and voluntary prepayments of indebtedness. Additionally AFFO is reconciled to cash flow from operations to adjust for real estate and REIT tax adjustments, REIT costs, Recall costs (as defined below), working capital adjustments and other non-cash expenses. Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation, Amortization, Intangible Impairments, and REIT Costs, or Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments, (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net, Recall Costs and REIT Costs. Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. We use multiples of current or projected Adjusted OIBDA in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our estimated overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin provide our current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment. These measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. www.ironmountain.com Selected metric definitions are available in the Appendix 41  

Appendix Non-GAAP Measures (continued) Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation, Amortization, Intangible Impairments, and REIT Costs, or Adjusted OIBDA (continued) Adjusted OIBDA does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) (gain) on sale of real estate, net of tax; (3) intangible impairments; (4) Recall Costs; (5) REIT Costs; (6) other expense (income), net; (7) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; (8) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax; and (9) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, Adjusted OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as operating or net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Funds From Operations, or FFO (NAREIT), and FFO (Normalized) Funds from operations (“FFO”) is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") and us as net income excluding (i) depreciation on real estate assets and (ii) gain on sale of real estate, net of tax (“FFO (NAREIT)”). FFO (NAREIT) does not give effect to real estate depreciation because these amounts are computed, under GAAP, to allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. Because values for well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased based upon prevailing market conditions, we believe that FFO (NAREIT) provides investors with a clearer view of our operating performance. Our most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO (NAREIT) is net income. Although NAREIT has published a definition of FFO, modifications to FFO (NAREIT) are common among REITs as companies seek to provide financial measures that most meaningfully reflect their particular business. Our definition of FFO (Normalized) excludes certain items included in FFO (NAREIT) that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) intangible impairments; (3) Recall Costs (as defined below); (4) REIT Costs; (5) other expense (income), net; (6) deferred income taxes and REIT tax adjustments; (7) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; and (8) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax. Service Adjusted OIBDA Service Adjusted OIBDA is calculated by taking service revenues excluding terminations and permanent withdrawals less direct expenses and allocated overhead tied to the service business. Terminations and permanent withdrawals are excluded from this calculations as they are included in the Storage NOI calculation. www.ironmountain.com Selected metric definitions are available in the Appendix 42  

Appendix Non-GAAP Measures (continued) Service Adjusted OIBDAR Service Adjusted OIBDA as defined above, excluding rent expense associated with the service business. This is provided to enable valuation of Service Adjusted OIBDA irrespective of whether the company’s properties are leased or owned. Related rent expense is provided in the Components of Value slide. Storage Net Operating Income, or Storage NOI Storage NOI is defined as revenue from rental activities (storage rental revenue, termination fees and permanent withdrawal fees) less storage rental costs. Storage rental costs include facility costs (excluding rent), storage rental labor, other storage costs and allocated overhead. Storage NOI is commonly used in the REIT industry and enables investors to understand and value the income generated from the company’s real estate. Rent expense is excluded to enable valuation of this income irrespective of whether the company’s properties are leased or owned. Related rent expense is provided in the Components of Value slide. www.ironmountain.com Selected metric definitions are available in the Appendix 43

Appendix Definitions (continued) Capacity Measures Building Capacity – The maximum number of cubic feet of records or standard DPUs that can be stored in a given facility. Building Capacity Utilization – The number of cubic feet of records or standard DPUs in storage divided by the Building Capacity. Installed Racking Capacity – The storage capacity of the racking installed in a given facility. Capacity is generally measured in cubic feet or standard DPUs. Installed Racking Capacity Utilization – The number of cubic feet of records or standard DPUs in storage divided by the Installed Racking Capacity. Capital Expenditures and Investments – Our business requires capital expenditures to support our expected storage rental revenue and service revenue growth and ongoing operations, new products and services and increased profitability. The majority of our capital goes to support business line growth and our ongoing operations. Additionally, we invest capital to acquire or construct real estate. We also expend capital to support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. These expenditures are generally relatively small and discretionary in nature. We categorize our capital expenditures as follows: Real Estate: Investment – Assets that support core business growth primarily related to investments in land, buildings, building improvements, leasehold improvements and racking structures that expand our revenue capacity in existing or new geographies, replace a long-term operational obligation or create operational efficiencies, or Real Estate Investment. Maintenance – Real estate assets necessary to maintain ongoing business operations primarily related to the repair or replacement of real estate assets such as buildings, building improvements, leasehold improvements and racking structures, or Real Estate Maintenance. Non-Real Estate: Investment – Non-real estate assets that either (i) support the growth of our business, and/or increase our profitability, such as customer-inventory technology systems, and technology service storage and processing capacity, or (ii) are directly related to the development of new products or services in support of our integrated value proposition and enhance our leadership position in the industry, including items such as increased feature functionality, security upgrades or system enhancements, or Non-Real Estate Investment. www.ironmountain.com Selected metric definitions are available in the Appendix 46  

Appendix Definitions (continued) Capital Expenditures and Investments (continued) Maintenance – Assets necessary to maintain ongoing business operations primarily related to the repair or replacement of customer-facing assets such as containers and shred bins, warehouse equipment, fixtures, computer hardware, or third-party or internally-developed software assets. This category also includes operational support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements, or Non-Real Estate Maintenance. Components of Overhead Allocated Overhead – Includes overhead expenses directly associated with storage and service business operations allocated as follows: Field Operation Costs – Allocated to storage and service operations based on percent of revenue. Bad Debt Expenses – Allocated to storage and service operations based on percent of revenue. Transportation Costs – Allocated fully to service operations.

Customer Acquisition Costs – Includes costs associated with the acquisition of customer relationships and customer inducements such as move costs and permanent withdrawal fees. www.ironmountain.com Selected metric definitions are available in the Appendix 47  

Appendix Definitions (continued) Destruction Rate – Calculated by dividing the total number of cubic feet of records removed from inventory due to destructions in a one-year period divided by the total number of cubic feet of records in storage at the beginning of the period. DPUs – Data protection units, a unit of measurement specific to our Data Protection storage services. Estimated CuFt / DPUs – Estimated based on expected growth and consolidation, resulting from moving boxes from one facility to another. Historical Average NOI / CF or DPU – The quarterly annualized Storage NOI for a specific region (NA, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific) and product (Records Management or Data Protection). Internal Revenue Growth – Internal revenue growth represents the year-over-year growth rate of revenues excluding the impacts of changes to foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and other unusual items. In general, only acquisitions that have been in our results for the full calendar year prior to the quarter of measurement are included in internal revenue growth. Investment in Current Period – Spend within the quarter being reported. Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio – The calculation for this ratio is EBITDA plus rent expense divided by net debt including the capitalized value of lease obligations. Net Volume Growth – New Records Management storage volume from existing customers, plus volume from new customers and volume from acquisitions, offset by volume related to destructions, permanent withdrawals and customer terminations. Quarterly percentages are calculated by dividing the trailing four quarters’ total activity by the ending balance of the same prior-year period. Non-Cash Rent Expense – Calculated as rent expense less cash paid for rent. Permanent Withdrawal Rate – Calculated by dividing the total number of cubic feet of records removed from inventory due to permanent withdrawals in a one-year period divided by the total number of cubic feet of records in storage at the beginning of the period. Permanent withdrawals occur when records are permanently removed from inventory by customers for reasons other than the customer terminating its relationship. Racking Installations – Defined as any incremental racking spend on buildings constructed or operated prior to January 1, 2014. Racking projects are tracked from first dollar spent until completion, which is defined as when the first box is entered into storage.
