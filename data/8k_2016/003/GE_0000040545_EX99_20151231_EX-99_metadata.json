        "The GE Capital Tier 1 common ratio estimate is the ratio of Tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets as calculated based on our interpretation of the standardized U.S. Basel 3 capital rules on a transitional basis, which is subject to review and consultation with our regulators. As such, the methodology of calculating this ratio may be refined over time as we discuss its interpretation and application with our regulators. As of December 31, 2015, we are not required by our regulators to disclose this capital ratio, and therefore this capital ratio is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that this estimated capital ratio is a useful measure to investors because it is widely used by analysts and regulators to assess the capital position of financial services companies."
