        "This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, but are not limited to, descriptions of NetApp’s future strategy and its impact on customers and partners. Actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: the response to the acquisition by the customers, employees, and strategic and business partners of both companies; the ability to retain key SolidFire and NetApp personnel; and NetApp’s ability to realize its broader strategic and operating objectives. These and other equally important factors are described in reports and documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the factors described under the section titled “Risk Factors” in our most recently submitted Annual Report on Form 10-K. We disclaim any obligation to update information contained in this press release whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise."
