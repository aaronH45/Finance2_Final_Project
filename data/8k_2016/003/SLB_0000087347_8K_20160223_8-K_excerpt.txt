 Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.  

On February 23, 2016, Patrick Schorn, President of Operations for Schlumberger Limited (“Schlumberger”), presented at the Credit Suisse 21st Annual Energy Summit in Vail, Colorado, to discuss, among other things, the current business outlook. The slide presentation is available on the Schlumberger Investor Relations website at http://investorcenter.slb.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=97513&p=irol-presentations and at http://www.slb.com/news/presentations.aspx.  

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  

The presentation referred to above contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws — that is, statements about the future, not about past events. Such statements often contain words such as “expect,” “may,” “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “intend,” “predict,” “anticipate,” “should,” “could,” “will,” “see,” “likely,” and other similar words. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to varying degrees, uncertain, such as statements about our financial and performance targets and other forecasts or expectations regarding business outlook; growth for Schlumberger as a whole and for each of its segments (and for specified products or geographic areas within a segment); oil and natural gas demand and production growth; oil and natural gas prices; improvements in operating procedures and technology; capital expenditures by Schlumberger and the oil and gas industry; the business strategies of Schlumberger’s customers; the integration of Cameron into our business; the anticipated benefits of the Cameron transaction; future global economic conditions; and future results of operations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, global economic conditions; changes in exploration and production spending by Schlumberger’s customers and changes in the level of oil and natural gas exploration and development; demand for our integrated services and new technologies; Schlumberger’s future cash flows; the success of Schlumberger’s transformation efforts; general economic, political and business conditions in key regions of the world; pricing erosion; weather and seasonal factors; operational modifications, delays and cancellations; production declines; changes in government regulations and regulatory requirements, including those related to offshore oil and gas exploration, radioactive sources, explosives, chemicals, hydraulic fracturing services and climate-related initiatives; the inability of technology to meet new challenges in exploration; satisfaction of the closing conditions to the Cameron merger; the risk that the contemplated Cameron merger will not occur, the inability after the closing of the Cameron merger to successfully integrate the merged businesses and to realize expected synergies, the inability to retain key employees; and other risks and uncertainties detailed in our most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize (or the consequences of such a development changes), or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those reflected in our forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the presentation, and Schlumberger disclaims any intention or obligation to update publicly or revise such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
