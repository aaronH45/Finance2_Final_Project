  (a)   Segment revenues includes both revenues and other income related to the segment. Segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations, the portion of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and accounting changes. Segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges and income taxes according to how a particular segment's management is measured – excluded in determining segment profit, which we sometimes refer to as "operating profit," for Power, Renewable Energy, Oil & Gas, Energy Management, Aviation, Healthcare, Transportation and Appliances & Lighting; included in determining segment profit, which we sometimes refer to as "net earnings," for Capital. Certain corporate costs, such as shared services, employee benefits and information technology are allocated to our segments based on usage. A portion of the remaining corporate costs are allocated based on each segment's relative net cost of operations. Total industrial segment revenues and profit include the sum of our eight industrial reporting segments without giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such segments. Total segment revenues and profit include the sum of our eight industrial segments and one financial services segment, without giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such segments. We believe that this provides investors with a view as to the results of all of our segments, without inter-segment eliminations and corporate items.

GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY 

Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP 

  We sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. These non-GAAP financial measures supplement our GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to the GAAP measure. We have referred to: 

     Industrial operating earnings and EPS and GE Capital operating earnings (loss) and EPS     

     GE Industrial operating + Verticals Earnings & EPS     

     GE Industrial + Verticals revenues     

     Industrial segment profit and profit margin (excluding Alstom)     

     Industrial operating profit and operating profit margin (excluding Alstom)     

     Industrial organic operating profit     

     Segment gross margins (excluding Alstom)     

     Industrial segment organic revenue growth     

     Industrial segment organic operating profit growth     

     Industrial cash flows from operating activities (Industrial CFOA)     

     Capital ending net investment (ENI), excluding liquidity     

     GE Capital Tier 1 common ratio estimate     

The reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures follow. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. 

   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)   Earnings (loss) per-share amounts are computed independently. As a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total.     

Operating earnings (loss) excludes non-service related pension costs of our principal pension plans comprising interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial gains/losses. The service cost, prior service cost and curtailment loss components of our principal pension plans are included in operating earnings. We believe that these components of pension cost better reflect the ongoing service-related costs of providing pension benefits to our employees. As such, we believe that our measure of operating earnings (loss) provides management and investors with a useful measure of the operational results of our business. Other components of GAAP pension cost are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance, and we manage these separately from the operational performance of our businesses. Neither GAAP nor operating pension costs are necessarily indicative of the current or future cash flow requirements related to our pension plan. We also believe that this measure, considered along with the corresponding GAAP measure, provides management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results to the operating results of other companies. 

We believe that presenting operating earnings and operating EPS separately for our industrial and financial services businesses also provides management and investors with useful information about the relative size of our industrial and financial services businesses in relation to the total company. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)   Verticals include businesses expected to be retained (GECAS, EFS, CLL, and run-off Insurance), including allocated corporate costs of $25 million and $58 million after tax in the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $133 million and $233 million after tax for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.     

  (b)   Earnings-per-share amounts are computed independently. As a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total.     

As described above, Verticals represents the GE Capital businesses that we expect to retain. We believe that presenting Industrial operating + Vertical earnings-per-share amounts provides management and investors with a useful measure to evaluate the performance of the businesses we expect to retain after the disposition of most of our financial services business.

  (a)   Verticals include businesses expected to be retained (GECAS, EFS, CLL, and run-off Insurance).     

As described above, Verticals represents the GE Capital businesses that we expect to retain. We believe that presenting Industrial + Verticals revenues amounts provides management and investors with a useful measure to evaluate the performance of the businesses we expect to retain after the disposition of most of our financial services business. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)   Loss from operations of the power and grid businesses of Alstom during the period of our ownership.     

We have presented our industrial segment profit and industrial segment profit margin excluding the results of our fourth quarter 2015 Alstom power and grid acquisition. We believe that operating profit and margin adjusted for the Alstom impacts are meaningful measures because they increase the comparability of period-to-period results. 

   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)   Excludes gains and GE-GE Capital Eliminations.     

  (b)   Excludes gains and restructuring.     

  (c)   Loss from operations of the power and grid businesses of Alstom during the period of our ownership.     

We have presented our Industrial margin excluding the results of our fourth quarter 2015 Alstom power and grid acquisition. We believe that Industrial margin adjusted for the Alstom impacts are meaningful measures because they increase the comparability of period-to-period results. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)   Includes gains and restructuring and excludes non-operating pension costs (pre-tax).     

Industrial organic operating profit growth measures Industrial operating profit excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates. We believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and currency exchange, which activities are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends. Management recognizes that the term "organic Industrial profit growth" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. Although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the respective businesses or companies and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We have presented our segment gross margin excluding the results of our fourth quarter 2015 Alstom power and grid acquisition. We believe that Industrial margin adjusted for the Alstom impacts are meaningful measures because they increase the comparability of period-to-period results. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Organic revenue growth measures revenue excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates. We believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and currency exchange, which activities are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends. We also believe that presenting organic revenue growth separately for our industrial businesses provides management and investors with useful information about the trends of our industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison to other non-financial businesses and companies. Management recognizes that the term "organic revenue growth" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances. Although this may have an effect on comparability of absolute percentage growth from company to company, we believe that these measures are useful in assessing trends of the respective businesses or companies and may therefore be a useful tool in assessing period-to-period performance trends.  

   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating profit growth measures profit excluding the effects of acquisitions, business dispositions and currency exchange rates. We believe that this measure provides management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and currency exchange, which activities are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying trends. Management recognizes that the term "organic operating profit growth" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We define "Industrial CFOA" as GE's cash from operating activities (continuing operations) less the amount of dividends received by GE from GE Capital. This includes the effects of intercompany transactions, including GE customer receivables sold to GE Capital; GE Capital services for trade receivables management and material procurement; buildings and equipment leased by GE from GE Capital; information technology (IT) and other services sold to GE Capital by GE; aircraft engines manufactured by GE that are installed on aircraft purchased by GE Capital from third-party producers for lease to others; and various investments, loans and allocations of GE corporate overhead costs. We believe that investors may find it useful to compare GE's operating cash flows without the effect of GE Capital dividends, since these dividends are not representative of the operating cash flows of our industrial businesses and can vary from period to period based upon the results of the financial services businesses. Management recognizes that this measure may not be comparable to cash flow results of companies which contain both industrial and financial services businesses, but believes that this comparison is aided by the provision of additional information about the amounts of dividends paid by our financial services business and the separate presentation in our financial statements of the GE Capital cash flows. We believe that our measure of Industrial CFOA provides management and investors with a useful measure to compare the capacity of our industrial operations to generate operating cash flow with the operating cash flow of other non-financial businesses and companies and as such provides a useful measure to supplement the reported GAAP CFOA measure. 

   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)   Liquidity includes cash and equivalents and $10.4 billion of high quality interest bearing deposits at December 31, 2015.     

  (b)   As originally reported.     

We use ENI to measure the size of our Capital segment. We believe that this measure is a useful indicator of the capital (debt or equity) required to fund a business as it adjusts for non-interest bearing current liabilities generated in the normal course of business that do not require a capital outlay. We also believe that by excluding liquidity, we provide a meaningful measure of assets requiring capital to fund our Capital segment as a substantial amount of liquidity resulted from debt issuances to pre-fund future debt maturities and will not be used to fund additional assets. Liquidity consists of cash and equivalents and certain high quality interest bearing deposits. As a general matter, investments included in liquidity are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. Providing this measure will help investors measure how we are performing against our previously communicated goal to reduce the size of our financial services segment. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)   Includes discontinued operations.     

  (b)   Total equity excluding noncontrolling interests.     

  (c)   Based on Basel 3 risk-weighted assets estimates.     

The GE Capital Tier 1 common ratio estimate is the ratio of Tier 1 common equity to total risk-weighted assets as calculated based on our interpretation of the standardized U.S. Basel 3 capital rules on a transitional basis, which is subject to review and consultation with our regulators. As such, the methodology of calculating this ratio may be refined over time as we discuss its interpretation and application with our regulators. As of December 31, 2015, we are not required by our regulators to disclose this capital ratio, and therefore this capital ratio is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that this estimated capital ratio is a useful measure to investors because it is widely used by analysts and regulators to assess the capital position of financial services companies.
