MEDICAL CLAIMS LIABILITY (In millions)

The changes in medical claims liability are summarized as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Centene's claims reserving process utilizes a consistent actuarial methodology to estimate Centene's ultimate liability. Any reduction in the “Incurred related to: Prior period” amount may be offset as Centene actuarially determines “Incurred related to: Current period.” As such, only in the absence of a consistent reserving methodology would favorable development of prior period claims liability estimates reduce medical costs. Centene believes it has consistently applied its claims reserving methodology in each of the periods presented. Additionally, as a result of minimum HBR and other return of premium programs, approximately $47 million of the “Incurred related to: Prior period” was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues. 

The amount of the “Incurred related to: Prior period” above represents favorable development and includes the effects of reserving under moderately adverse conditions, new markets where we use a conservative approach in setting reserves during the initial periods of operations, receipts from other third party payors related to coordination of benefits and lower medical utilization and cost trends for dates of service December 31, 2014 and prior.
