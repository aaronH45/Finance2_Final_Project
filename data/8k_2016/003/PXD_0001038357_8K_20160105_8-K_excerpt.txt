 Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition  

On January 5, 2016, Pioneer Natural Resources (“Pioneer” or the “Company”) issued the news release that is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 (the “News Release”). In the News Release, the Company provided an operational update for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2015, and preliminary information regarding its 2016 capital program.  

 Item 8.01. Other Events  

As part of the News Release, on January 5, 2016, the Company announced that it expects fourth quarter 2015 production to be between 213 thousand barrels equivalent per day (“MBOEPD”) to 215 MBOEPD, which is above the top end of the Company’s previously announced production forecast of 206 MBOEPD to 211 MBOEPD. The increase in production guidance is driven by the Company’s Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program, which continues to deliver better than expected horizontal well results across the Company’s large acreage position. During the fourth quarter, Pioneer placed 44 Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal wells on production as expected, including 35 wells in the Company’s northern acreage (22 of which targeted the Wolfcamp B interval, 11 of which were Lower Spraberry Shale wells and two of which were Wolfcamp A interval wells) and nine wells in the Company’s southern Wolfcamp joint venture area. The completion optimization program was expanded at the end of the third quarter of 2015 to include an additional 50 horizontal wells as a result of the strong production exhibited by the Company’s initial 26-well completion optimization program. Almost all of the Spraberry/Wolfcamp wells completed during the fourth quarter benefited from the Company’s continuing completion optimization program.  

The Company expects that its full-year 2015 capital budget expenditures will remain consistent with its previously forecast budget of $2.2 billion (excluding acquisitions, asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical administrative costs).  

Production costs for the fourth quarter are expected to average $11.00 per barrel of oil equivalent (“BOE”) to $13.00 per BOE. Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense is expected to average $21.50 per BOE to $23.50 per BOE. Total exploration and abandonment expense is expected to be less than $25 million.  

General and administrative expense for the fourth quarter is expected to be $80 million to $85 million, interest expense is expected to be $45 million to $50 million and other expense is expected to be $40 million to $50 million. Other expense includes $18 million to $20 million for stacked drilling rig charges. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is expected to be $3 million to $5 million.  

During the fourth quarter of 2015, Pioneer may also recognize unusual noncash impairment charges related to reducing the carrying value of its (i) proved oil and gas properties by $800 million to $1.0 billion (principally related to reducing the carrying value of its Eagle Ford Shale assets as a result of low oil, gas and natural gas liquids prices) and (ii) pipe inventory by $50 million to $70 million, as the inventory is not expected to be used primarily as a result of eliminating vertical well drilling. The preliminary estimate of impairment charges is subject to the completion of the Company’s financial closing procedures. Accordingly, these results are subject to change.  

The Company’s effective income tax rate is expected to range from 35% to 40%. Current income taxes are expected to be $10 million to $20 million and are primarily attributable to alternative minimum taxes that remain to be recognized as a result of the sale of the Company’s interest in EFS Midstream LLC (the “EFS Midstream sale”) in July 2015.  

The Company currently has 35,000 barrels of oil per day (“BOPD”) of production for the first half of 2016 covered with swaps at an average price of $60 per barrel and the remaining 65,500 BOPD of its first half of 2016 derivative position covered with three-way collars at an average short put price of $43, an average put price of $63 and an average call price of $73. For the second half of 2016, the Company has 112,000 BOPD of three-way collar derivative positions at an average short put price of $47, an average put price of $65 and an average call price of $76.
