On and effective as of January 13, 2016, the Board of Directors of Equinix, Inc (“Equinix”) adopted Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”).  

Section 3.10 of Article III of the Bylaws has been amended to permit the removal of a director at any time by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, without cause, consistent with Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Previously, such section of the Bylaws only permitted removal of a director with cause.  

The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
