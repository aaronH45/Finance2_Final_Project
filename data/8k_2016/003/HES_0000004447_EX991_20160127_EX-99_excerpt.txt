NEW YORK, January 27, 2016, — Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) today reported an adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability, of $396 million or $1.40 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with adjusted net income of $53 million or $0.18 per share in the  

1 

fourth quarter of 2014. Lower realized selling prices reduced adjusted net income by approximately $420 million compared with the prior-year quarter. On an unadjusted basis, the Corporation reported a net loss of $1,821 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a net loss of $8 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter 2015 results included noncash goodwill and other impairment related charges totaling $1,359 million after tax. 

 “We finished 2015 with one of the strongest balance sheets and liquidity positions among our E&P peers,” Chief Executive Officer John Hess said. “Looking forward, our top priority is to continue to keep our balance sheet strong. Our 2016 capital and exploratory budget is 40 percent below our 2015 spend and we will continue to pursue further cost reductions. At the same time, we plan to continue to invest in future growth.”

Exploration and Production: 

The Exploration and Production adjusted net loss in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $328 million compared with adjusted net income of $138 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. On an unadjusted basis, Exploration and Production had a net loss of $1,713 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with net income of $83 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.  

The Corporation’s average worldwide crude oil selling price, including the effect of hedging, was down 42 percent to $43.73 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015 from $75.34 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014. The average worldwide natural gas liquids selling price was $9.61 per barrel, down

from $22.37 per barrel in the year-ago quarter while the average worldwide natural gas selling price was $3.44 per mcf in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $5.24 per mcf in the fourth quarter a year ago. 

Excluding production from assets sold and Libya, pro forma net production in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 358,000 boepd, up 4 percent from 343,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2014. Production growth at the Utica shale play (17,000 boepd), the Bakken shale play (7,000 boepd) and the Gulf of Mexico (5,000 boepd) was offset by lower production from the Joint Development area of Malaysia/Thailand (10,000 boepd) and Denmark (5,000 boepd). Our Algeria operations, which had production of 10,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2015 (9,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2014) were sold in December. The Corporation expects 2016 net production, excluding Libya, to average between 330,000 boepd and 350,000 boepd compared with 2015 net production of 368,000 boepd, excluding Libya and asset sales. 

Oil and Gas Reserve Estimates:  

Oil and gas proved reserves were 1,086 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2015, compared with 1,431 million boe at December 31, 2014. Lower crude oil prices and reduced drilling plans resulted in negative revisions to proved reserves of 282 million boe. Proved reserve additions and other technical revisions added 84 million boe in 2015, primarily from Bakken drilling activity in 2015. Proved developed reserves at December 31, 2015 were 795 million boe, up from 762 million boe at December 31, 2014. 

Operational Highlights for the Fourth Quarter of 2015: 

Bakken (Onshore U.S.): Net production from the Bakken increased approximately 7 percent to 109,000 boepd from the prior-year quarter due to continued drilling activities. The Corporation brought 34 gross operated wells on production in the fourth quarter of 2015 increasing the year-to-date total to 219 wells. Drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged $5.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, down 28 percent from the year-ago quarter.  

Utica (Onshore U.S.): On the Corporation’s joint venture acreage, 8 wells were brought on production and net production averaged 30,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with 13,000 boepd in the prior-year quarter. 

Gulf of Mexico (Offshore U.S.): Net production from the Gulf of Mexico was 72,000 boepd compared to 67,000 boepd in the prior-year quarter, with higher volumes from Tubular Bells, which totaled 17,000 boepd in the fourth quarter of 2015, being partially offset by lower production from the  

4 

Conger, Llano and Shenzi Fields. Drilling at the ConocoPhillips operated Melmar exploration project (Hess 35 percent) in the Alaminos Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico commenced in December. 

North Malay Basin (Offshore Malaysia): Development drilling commenced in December 2015 with full field development anticipated to be completed in 2017.  

Guyana (Offshore): On the Stabroek Block (Hess 30 percent), the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, announced a significant oil discovery at the Liza #1 well in the second quarter of 2015. The operator is currently in the process of acquiring approximately 17,000 square kilometers of 3D seismic on the block and is expected to commence drilling of the Liza #2 well in the first quarter of 2016. 

Bakken Midstream: 

The Corporation’s Bakken Midstream segment had net income of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $8 million in the prior-year quarter. 

Capital and Exploratory Expenditures: 

Exploration and Production capital and exploratory expenditures were $943 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 down from $1,575 million in the prior-year quarter reflecting reduced activities primarily in the United States, Norway and Equatorial Guinea. Full year 2016 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are forecast to be $2.4 billion or 40 percent lower than 2015. 

Bakken Midstream capital expenditures were $103 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $133 million in the year-ago quarter. In 2016, the Bakken Midstream capital budget is $340 million up from full year 2015 capital expenditures of $296 million. 

Liquidity: 

Cash provided by operating activities was $623 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with $1,074 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents, excluding Bakken Midstream, were $2,713 million compared with $2,444 million at December 31, 2014. Total debt, excluding Bakken Midstream, was $5,920 million at December 31, 2015 compared with $5,987 million at December 31, 2014.

In addition, exploration costs include charges totaling $178 million after tax ($271 million pre tax) for the write-off of previously capitalized gas wells in Ghana, three previously capitalized wells in Australia that are not included in the most recent development concept, and the impairment of certain leasehold costs in the Gulf of Mexico. The Corporation also recognized an asset impairment charge of $83 million after tax ($133 million pre tax) associated with our legacy conventional assets in North Dakota.
