SUMMARY FINANCIAL TABLE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results for further detail of Special Items. Special Items for 2015 are primarily related to charges for the refranchising of certain international markets, U.S. refranchising gains and charges associated with the agreement reached with KFC U.S. franchisees. Special Items for 2014 are primarily related to the impairment of Little Sheep and U.S. refranchising gains. 

GREG CREED COMMENTS

Greg Creed, CEO, said “I’m pleased with the positive sales momentum we generated across the majority of Yum! in the fourth quarter. KFC China, for example, grew same-store sales 6% in the last quarter of 2015. Outside of China, each of our brand divisions grew same-store sales on a one-year and a two-year basis. Our U.S. results were particularly strong on a two-year basis, with growth of 2% at Pizza Hut, 8% at KFC and 10% at Taco Bell.

Fourth-quarter EPS grew 11%, with full-year EPS growth of 3% despite a 7% decline in the first half and six percentage points of foreign currency headwinds. For the full year, our brand divisions collectively grew operating profit 8% in constant currency, led by 12% operating profit growth at Taco Bell. Operating profit grew 8% in constant currency in China with impressive cost management partially offsetting weaker than originally anticipated sales results.

New-unit development continues to be a bright spot for our company. We added more than 2,300 new units globally in 2015. This year we expect to open nearly 2,400 new restaurants, which means we’re opening over six new restaurants a day, laying the groundwork for future growth. With all of this in mind, we are reiterating the guidance we initially gave in December. Given the results we have seen year-to-date and the plans we have laid out for each of the brands, we're confident in our ability to deliver 10% operating profit growth in constant currency in 2016. 

2016 will be a transformational year for Yum! as we are on track to complete the spin-off of our China Division, ultimately creating two powerful, independent, focused growth companies. The fundamental goal of Yum!, however, is unchanged. We are 100% dedicated to building and strengthening KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell all around the world, as strong brands are critical to delivering sustained growth and creating shareholder value over the long term."

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results

(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)

(unaudited)

In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") throughout this document, the Company has provided non-GAAP measurements which present operating results in 2015 and 2014 on a basis before Special Items. Included in Special Items are gains/(losses) associated with the refranchising of equity markets outside the U.S., costs associated with the KFC U.S. Acceleration Agreement, a loss associated with the planned sale of an aircraft in China, costs associated with the planned spin-off of the China business and YUM! recapitalization, U.S. refranchising gains and the impairment of certain Little Sheep assets in 2014. These amounts are described in (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) in the accompanying notes.

The Company uses earnings before Special Items as a key performance measure of results of the operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally and Special Items are not included in any of our segment results. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before Special Items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items in the quarters and years to date ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.

Notes to the Consolidated Summary of Results, Consolidated Balance Sheets

and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)

(unaudited)

(a)Amounts presented as of and for the quarter and year ended December 26, 2015 are preliminary.

(b)Other (income) expense for the China Division primarily consists of equity income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The quarters ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 also include insurance recoveries of $5 million and $25 million, respectively, related to the 2012 poultry supply incident. 

(c)In 2010 we refranchised our then remaining Company-operated restaurants in Mexico. To the extent we owned it, we did not sell the real estate related to certain of these restaurants, instead leasing it to the franchisee. During the quarter ended June 13, 2015 we initiated plans to sell this real estate and determined it was held for sale in accordance with GAAP. During the quarter ended December 26, 2015, we sold the real estate for approximately $58 million. While these proceeds exceeded the book value of the real estate, the sale represented a substantial liquidation of our Mexican operations under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, we were required to write-off accumulated translation losses associated with our Mexican business. As such, during the year to date ended December 26, 2015 we recorded charges of $80 million, representing the excess of the sum of the book value of the real estate and other related assets and our accumulated translation losses over the sales price. Consistent with the classification of the original market refranchising transaction, these charges were classified as Refranchising Loss within Special Items. Additionally, during the quarter and year to date ended December 26, 2015 we recognized Special Items charges of $3 million and $16 million, respectively, associated with the refranchising of our Pizza Hut Korea restaurants. The carrying value of the remaining restaurants not yet sold as of year end is not significant. While additional charges may occur as the refranchising plans move forward, such charges are not expected to be material at this time.

(d)During the first quarter of 2015, we reached an agreement with our KFC U.S. franchisees that gave us brand marketing control as well as an accelerated path to improved assets and customer experience. In connection with this agreement we recognized Special Item charges for the quarter and year to date ended December 26, 2015 of $41 million and $72 million, respectively, primarily related to the funding of investments for new back-of-house equipment for franchisees. 

(e)During the quarter ended December 26, 2015, we initiated plans to sell an aircraft used in our China Division and determined it was held for sale, resulting in a write down of $15 million.

(f)In October 2015 we announced our intent to spin off YUM!’s China Division from YUM! Brands into a separate independent, publicly-traded company by the end of 2016. A part of this plan is to optimize the capital structure of YUM! Brands through the issuance of new debt that will allow us to return significant capital to shareholders. During the quarter ended December 26, 2015 we incurred costs of $9 million related to these initiatives. 

(g)During the quarters ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, we recorded Special Item gains of $51 million and losses of $5 million, respectively, related to refranchising in the U.S. During the years to date ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, we recorded Special Item gains of $75 million and $6 million, respectively, related to refranchising in the U.S. Refranchising gains and losses in the U.S. have been reflected as Special Items due to the scope of our U.S. refranchising program in recent years and the volatility in associated gains and losses.

(h)During the quarter ended December 27, 2014, we recorded an impairment charge related to Little Sheep totaling $361 million (net of income tax benefit of $76 million and amounts allocated to noncontrolling interests of $26 million). This charge was driven by a write down in trademark from $342 million to $58 million and a write off of all remaining goodwill of $160 million.
