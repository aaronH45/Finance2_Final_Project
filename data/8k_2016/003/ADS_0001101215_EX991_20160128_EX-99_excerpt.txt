Ed Heffernan, president and chief executive officer of Alliance Data, commented, "It was an exceptional year for Alliance Data as we drove 20 percent growth in both revenue and core EPS despite substantial FX headwinds. Overall, the scorecard for all three segments is largely positive. 

"Starting with LoyaltyOne®, AIR MILES® fought through a difficult Canadian economy to produce a 4 percent increase in AIR MILES reward miles issued. A shift in sponsor mix, which lowered the average price per mile issued, coupled with increased support of our sponsors' promotional programs pressured Loyalty One's financial results as AIR MILES revenue increased 1 percent, while adjusted EBITDA dropped 6 percent on a constant currency basis. In contrast, BrandLoyalty continued to execute, increasing revenue 31 percent and adjusted EBITDA 15 percent on a constant currency basis. These results build on revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth north of 25 percent in 2014. Tremendous results during our two years of ownership. 

"Shifting to Epsilon®, organic revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased 5 percent compared to 2014. Notably, organic revenue growth flowed directly to the bottom-line, which was a priority for 2015. For Conversant, it was a tale of two-halves. During the first-half of 2015, pro-forma revenue and adjusted EBITDA decreased 8 percent and 3 percent, respectively, as we transitioned the business model and pruned non-core offerings. While the changes needed to be made, the impact to the financial results was greater than we had expected. With that largely done, we turned the corner in the second-half of 2015, as pro-forma revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased 4 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Importantly, revenue growth accelerated to 6 percent in the fourth quarter providing a nice jump-off point for 2016. 

"The star of the year was Card Services with revenue and adjusted EBITDA, net up 24 percent and 16 percent, respectively, compared to 2014. Credit sales and average card receivables both increased a notable 30 percent, as we added over 150 basis points to our tender share at existing clients. The pipeline for new clients remains strong, and I am looking forward to continued strong results in 2016." 

FULL-YEAR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 

Revenue increased 21 percent to $6.44 billion and adjusted EBITDA, net increased 21 percent to $1.73 billion for 2015. EPS increased 12 percent to $8.82 for 2015. Core EPS increased 20 percent to $15.05 for 2015, exceeding guidance of $15.00. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced revenue and core EPS by approximately $240 million and $0.46, respectively, compared to 2014. 

FOURTH-QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 

Revenue increased 18 percent to $1.75 billion and adjusted EBITDA, net increased 18 percent to $453 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. EPS increased 169 percent to $2.31 for the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding acquisition related charges in both years, EPS was down slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Core EPS increased 20 percent to $4.13 for the fourth quarter of 2015. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced revenue and core EPS by approximately $67 million and $0.12, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.

FOURTH-QUARTER SEGMENT REVIEW 

LoyaltyOne: Revenue decreased 9 percent to $364 million, and adjusted EBITDA decreased 25 percent to $86 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 6 percent, while adjusted EBITDA decreased 13 percent, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 

AIR MILES reward miles issuance decreased 8 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as sponsor promotional activity was more heavily weighted to the first-half of 2015 compared to second-half for 2014. AIR MILES reward miles redeemed decreased 2 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily correlated with the decrease in AIR MILES reward miles issued. The instant reward program option, AM Cash, represented 21 percent and 29 percent of miles issued and redeemed, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2015. 

BrandLoyalty's North American expansion efforts continue to develop. Currently, contracts aggregating in excess of $45 million have been signed in Canada, and a pilot program is expected to launch in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2016. 

Epsilon: Revenue increased 38 percent to $608 million, and adjusted EBITDA increased 54 percent to $157 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, aided by the Conversant acquisition. Excluding Conversant, revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased 7 percent and 5 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2015, driven by strength in technology solutions. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 300 basis points to 26 percent for the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to the Conversant acquisition. 

The first-half of 2015 was devoted to the transition of Conversant's business model from its historic site-based advertising approach to a richer, data-driven, audience-based approach. While the transition process is still ongoing, the negative impact of pruning these lower margin offerings is largely gone. For the fourth quarter of 2015, pro-forma revenue increased 6 percent, while pro-forma adjusted EBITDA increased a robust 14 percent. Importantly, cross-selling efforts to Epsilon's and Card Services' clients continue to go well with a signed backlog at year-end exceeding $90 million in annual contract value. 

Card Services (previously named Private Label Services and Credit): Revenue increased 20 percent to $785 million and adjusted EBITDA, net increased 16 percent to $246 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Operating expenses increased 10 percent to $291 million, representing 9.3 percent of average receivables compared to 10.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014. The loan loss provision increased 44 percent to $206 million, driven by strong growth in average card receivables and a 90 basis points increase in principal loss rates from historical lows. Portfolio funding costs were $42 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, or 1.3 percent of average credit card receivables, 10 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2014.

Credit sales increased 22 percent to $7.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, supported by an 11 percent increase in core cardholder spending as tender share gains continued. Average credit card receivables increased 25 percent to $12.5 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, while net principal loss rates for the fourth quarter of 2015 were 4.7 percent, up 90 basis points from last year. The increase is primarily due to the seasoning of the large 2013 vintage, which consisted mostly of start-up programs, and lower recoveries. 

Guidance 

The Company is maintaining its 2016 constant currency guidance of $7.2 billion in revenue, a 12 percent increase compared to 2015, and $17.00 in core EPS, a 13 percent increase compared to 2015. 

On a constant currency basis, guidance for the first quarter of 2016 is $1.72 billion in revenue and $3.93 in core EPS, an 8 percent growth rate for both. On a reported basis, guidance for the first quarter of 2016 is $1.68 billion in revenue and $3.83 in core EPS, a 5 percent growth rate for both. This guidance assumes translation rates of $0.69 for CAD/USD and $1.00 for EUR/USD.
