Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

The Registrant is filing this Amendment No. 1 to the 8-K filed on January 29, 2016 regarding the news release announcing an unaudited loss of $588 million in fourth quarter 2015. A correction was made to the first sentence of the opening paragraph of page 1, where the word “earnings” was changed to “loss.” In addition the word "(LOSS)" was added to the line item text "NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHEVRON CORPRATION" in Attachment 1. The same change was made in footnote 2 of Attachment 2.

Except as described above, the Registrant has made no other changes.

The press release issued to the news wire services correctly reflected the use of the word “loss” in the first sentence. It also included the addition of "(LOSS)" within the description "NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHEVRON CORPORATION" in Attachment 1 and footnote 2 of Attachment 2.

The information included herein and in Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933.
