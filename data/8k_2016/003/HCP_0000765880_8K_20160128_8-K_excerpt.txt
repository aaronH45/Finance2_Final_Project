Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year. 

On January 28, 2016, the board of directors of HCP, Inc. (the “Company”) adopted Amendment No. 1 to the Fifth Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the “Amendment”) to modify the previously adopted proxy access bylaw. Among other things, the Amendment: 

· Reduces the qualifying ownership threshold from 5% to 3% of the Company’s outstanding common stock; 

· Provides that a minimum of two stockholder-nominated candidates will be eligible for inclusion in the Company’s proxy materials; 

· Increases the number of stockholders who may aggregate their shares to meet the 3% ownership threshold from 10 to 25; 

· Provides that certain related funds will be counted as one stockholder for purposes of the aggregation limit; 

· Clarifies that loaned shares are counted toward the ownership requirement, provided that certain recall requirements are met; 

· Removes the requirement that a nominating stockholder provide a representation as to its intentions with respect to continuing to own the required number of shares for at least one year following the applicable annual meeting; and 

· Decreases the minimum level of support a proxy access candidate is required to receive in order to be eligible to be a proxy access nominee for the next two annual meetings from 25% to 10% of the votes cast. 

In addition, the Amendment modifies provisions of the proxy access bylaw relating to the disclosure, representations and agreements required to be provided by nominating stockholders, and adds certain other procedural provisions and clarifications. 

The foregoing description of the Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amendment, a copy of which is included as Exhibit 3.1 to this report and incorporated by reference herein.
