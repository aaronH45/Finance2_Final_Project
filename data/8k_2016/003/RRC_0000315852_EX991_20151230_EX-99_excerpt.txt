Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements  

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is presented to illustrate the effect of Range Resources Corporation’s (“Range”, “our”, “we”) sale of certain assets in Virginia and West Virginia on our historical financial position and operating results. The sale closed on December 30, 2015. The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations have been prepared to assist in the analysis of the financial effects of the divestiture. This divestiture does not qualify as a discontinued operation under ASC 205 after our 2014 adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-08. This pro forma information is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Range and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying footnotes and the financial statements included in the Range Resources Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2015 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and the nine months ended September 30, 2015, filed with the SEC on October 28, 2015.  

The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2015 has been prepared to give effect to the divestiture as if it had occurred on September 30, 2015. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015 have been prepared to give effect to the divestiture as if it had occurred on January 1, 2014.  

The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations included herein are for information purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the results that might have occurred had the divestiture taken place on the respective dates assumed. Actual results may differ significantly from those reflected here in the unaudited consolidated pro forma financial statements for various reasons, including but not limited to, the differences between the assumptions used to prepare the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements and actual results. The pro forma adjustments in the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and the statements of operations included herein include the use of estimates and assumptions as described in the accompanying notes. The pro forma adjustments are based on information available to management at the time these unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements were prepared. We believe our current estimates provide a reasonable basis of presenting the significant effects of the transaction. However, the estimates and assumptions are subject to change as additional information becomes available. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements only include adjustments related to the disposition of the Virginia and West Virginia assets.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

(1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

On December 30, 2015, we completed the sale of our certain assets in Virginia and West Virginia for a purchase price of $876.0 million subject to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement dated November 3, 2015. The sale has an effective date of November 1, 2015 and consequently operating net revenues after that date is a downward adjustment to the selling price through the normal post-closing provisions of the agreement.  

The accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations have been prepared to give effect to the divestiture as if it had occurred on September 30, 2015 for the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and on January 1, 2014 for the unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations.  

The following are descriptions of the individual columns included in the accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and the accompanying unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations.
