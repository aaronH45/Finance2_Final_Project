Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On February 2, 2016, salesforce.com, inc. (the “Company”) announced the appointment of Keith Block as the Company’s Chief Operating Officer, effective February 1, 2016. Mr. Block, age 54, will continue to serve as a member of the board of directors and as the Company’s Vice Chairman and President. 

Mr. Block joined the Company as a director and as Vice Chairman and President in June 2013. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Block served as Executive Vice President, North America of Oracle Corporation (“Oracle”) from 2002 to 2012. Prior to that position, Mr. Block held various other positions at Oracle beginning in 1986. 

There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Block and any other persons pursuant to which he was selected as an officer or director, he has no family relationships with any of the Company’s directors or executive officers, and he has no direct or indirect material interest in any transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

Attached to this Form 8-K is a press release regarding Mr. Block’s appointment as Chief Operating Officer. The information in the press release attached hereto shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act.

Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

Bylaw Amendment

On February 1, 2016, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company amended and restated the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) (i) to remove the words “for cause” in Article II, Section 2.5 to confirm that any members of the Board may be removed with or without cause as specified in the Bylaws, and (ii) to make other conforming changes consistent with the declassification of the Board that was completed at the Company’s 2015 annual meeting of stockholders. The amended and restated Bylaws were effective as of February 1, 2016. 

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Bylaws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Proposal to Amend Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation

On February 1, 2016, the Board approved a form of the amendment and restatement of the Company’s current Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (i) to remove the words “only for cause” in Article Sixth, Section C to confirm that any members of the Board may be removed with or without cause, and (ii) to make other conforming changes consistent with the declassification of the Board that was completed at the Company’s 2015 annual meeting of stockholders. The Board directed that the amendment and restatement of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation be submitted to stockholders for approval at the Company’s 2016 annual meeting of stockholders. 

Consistent with the Board’s action, and in light of a recent ruling by the Delaware Chancery Court in a proceeding not involving the Company, the Board has approved a resolution directing the Company not to enforce the “only for cause” element of the current director removal provision.
