ARMONK, N.Y., January 19, 2016 . . . IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced fourth-quarter 2015 diluted earnings from continuing operations of $4.59 per share, down 17 percent year-to-year. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings from continuing operations were $4.84 per share, compared with operating diluted earnings of $5.81 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014, down 17 percent. The prior-year gain from the divestiture of the System x business impacted operating diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by 20 points. 

“We continue to make significant progress in our transformation to higher value. In 2015, our strategic imperatives of cloud, analytics, mobile, social and security 

grew 26 percent to $29 billion and now represent 35 percent of our total revenue,” said Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer. “We strengthened our existing portfolio while investing aggressively in new opportunities like Watson Health, Watson Internet of Things and hybrid cloud. As we transform to a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company, we are well positioned to continue delivering greater value to our clients and returning capital to our shareholders.” 

Fourth-quarter net income from continuing operations was $4.5 billion compared with $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, down 19 percent. Operating (non-GAAP) net income was $4.7 billion compared with $5.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, down 19 percent. The prior-year gain from the divestiture of the System x business impacted operating net income by 19 points. 

Total revenues from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $22.1 billion were down 9 percent (down 2 percent adjusting for currency) from the fourth quarter of 2014. 

GAAP — Operating (non-GAAP) Reconciliation 

Fourth-quarter operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings exclude $0.25 per share of charges: $0.11 per share for the amortization of purchased intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, and $0.14 per share for non-operating retirement-related charges driven by changes to plan assets and liabilities primarily related to past market performance. 

Full-year operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings exclude $1.32 per share of charges: $0.57 per share for the amortization of purchased intangible assets and other acquisition-related charges, and $0.75 per share for non-operating retirement-related charges driven by changes to plan assets and liabilities primarily related to past market performance.

29 29 Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company also discusses, in its earnings press release and earnings presentation materials, the following Non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors. Operating (Non-GAAP) Earnings Per Share and Related Income Statement Items Management presents certain financial measures from continuing operations excluding the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, non-operating retirement-related costs and any related tax impacts. Management uses the term "operating" to describe this view of the company's financial results and other financial information. For acquisitions, these measures exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable restructuring and related expenses, and tax charges related to acquisition integration. For retirement-related costs, the company has characterized certain items as operating and others as non-operating. The company includes service cost, amortization of prior service cost and the cost of defined contribution plans in its operating results. Non-operating retirement-related costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements, multi-employer plan costs, pension insolvency costs, and other costs. Non-operating costs primarily relate to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to market performance, and management considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Management’s calculation of these operating measures, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Overall, management believes that providing investors with an operating view as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company’s pension plans, improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance, enables better comparison to peer companies, and allows the company to provide a long term strategic view of the business going forward. For its earnings per share guidance, the company is utilizing an operating view to establish its objectives and track its progress. The company’s segment financial results and performance reflect operating earnings, consistent with the company’s management and measurement system. Constant Currency Management refers to growth rates at constant currency or adjusting for currency so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the company's business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior year period’s currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates. Supplemental Materials 

Non-GAAP Supplemental Materials Cash Flow Management uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company’s operating results, plan share repurchase levels, evaluate strategic investments and assess the company’s ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and cash flow from operations that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Debt-to-Capital Ratio Management presents its debt-to-capital ratio excluding the Global Financing business. A financing business is managed on a leveraged basis. The company funds its Global Financing segment using a debt-to-equity ratio target of approximately 7 to 1. Given this significant leverage, the company presents a debt-to-capital ratio which excludes the Global Financing segment debt and equity because the company believes this is more representative of the company’s core business operations. Customer Care Outsourcing and System x Business Divestiture With respect to the sale of IBM's worldwide customer care outsourcing services business to SYNNEX, the initial closing date was January 31, 2014. With respect to the sale of IBM’s x86 server business to Lenovo, the initial closing date was October 1, 2014. Management believes that presenting financial information without either or both of these items is more representative of operational performance and provides additional insight into, and clarifies the basis for, historical and/or future performance, which may be more useful to investors.
