 CEO Walt Bettinger said, “Schwab’s ‘through clients’ eyes’ strategy remains the driver of our growth. Effective execution of this strategy helped us succeed with clients throughout 2015 as they faced a generally difficult investing environment. A fundatmental measure of our success is the willingness of new and existing clients to bring their hard-earned assets to us. This year, we attracted $134.7 billion in core net new assets, up 8% from 2014 and in excess of $100 billion for the fourth consecutive year. Total client assets at year-end were $2.51 trillion, up   

 - 1 -  

$50.2 billion or 2%, solidifying our leadership among publicly-traded US investment services firms. Clients opened 1.1 million new brokerage accounts, up 10% from the previous year. We ended 2015 with 9.8 million active brokerage accounts, 1.0 million banking accounts, and 1.5 million retirement plan participants, up 4%, 5% and 6%, respectively. Over the past 12 months, Schwab’s expanded wealth management capabilities continued to fill an important need with our growing client base; over 155,000 accounts enrolled in one of our retail advisory solutions, up 60% from 2014. At year-end 2015, approximately 560,000 client accounts were using these solutions, 14% more than a year ago.”   

 “We know that when we do right by clients they will choose to do more business with us, and if we manage that trusted relationship with care it will help produce strong business performance. This proved true again in 2015,” Mr. Bettinger continued. “We achieved record annual net revenues of $6.4 billion, up 5% from last year. Our consistent asset-gathering and strong growth in interest-bearing assets helped to offset the effects of sideways market returns, moderate trading activity, and continued low interest rates. As the year progressed, we kept to the expense goals we laid out in February and produced record annual net income of $1.4 billion, an increase of 10% from 2014.”  

 Mr. Bettinger said, “The products and services we developed this year reflect Schwab’s ongoing commitment to challenge the status quo, looking for ways to offer our clients more value and a better investing experience. As part of our dedication to offering a contemporary, full-service approach to helping clients build and manage their wealth, we launched Schwab Intelligent Portfolios™, our fully automated investment advisory service which uses sophisticated algorithms to build, monitor, and rebalance diversified portfolios. Featuring a fully online experience – supported by 24/7/365 live professional help – and zero advisory, commission, or account service fees charged, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios represents yet another option for clients who are interested in advised investing. Institutional Intelligent Portfolios™, our version for registered independent advisors, allows RIAs to customize the platform and automate portions of the investment process to complement other approaches in their businesses. Continuing our commitment to provide the greatest value for investors, we expanded Schwab ETF OneSource™ with the addition of 36 new funds over the past twelve months. As of year-end, clients could build a diversified portfolio choosing from 214 ETFs that cover 66 Morningstar Categories, all for $0 online trade commissions. Retirement savings remain the lynchpin motivation for most American investors, and this year Schwab Retirement Plan Services introduced Advisor Managed Accounts, enabling plan consultants who are RIAs to build and manage customized investment portfolios for the plans they support. These managed accounts give employers and plan consultants much more flexibility in designing advice programs to meet the specific needs of employee participants, a key criteria of retirement investing success in our view.” Mr. Bettinger concluded, “As we head into 2016, we are focused on deepening our capabilities around client relationships, financial planning, and advisory solutions.”  

 CFO Joe Martinetto commented, “We produced solid financial results in 2015, including meaningful operating leverage, despite a tougher than expected environment. We entered the year anticipating S&P 500 appreciation of 6.5%, client daily average revenue trade growth of 5%, and a Fed Funds rate of 0-0.25%. Based on that scenario we targeted mid-to-upper single digit revenue growth, a gap between revenue and expense growth of 150 basis points, and a pre-tax profit margin of around 36%. What we encountered was a 1% drop in the S&P, a 2% drop in revenue trades, and Fed Funds basically flat at 0.12% until the Federal Reserve announced its first rate increase on December 17th. Under these conditions we still delivered 5% annual revenue growth. Asset management and administration fee revenue of $2.7 billion grew 5% from a year ago, while net interest revenue of $2.5 billion grew 11%. Both represent annual records and helped offset a 5% decline in trading revenue. In light of the weaker than expected environment, we carefully limited expense growth to 4%, which enabled us to generate a 130 basis point revenue/expense growth gap and deliver a 36% pre-tax profit margin.”  

 Mr. Martinetto concluded, “We continue to manage the company’s balance sheet to support growth initiatives and to execute on our strategy of optimizing the spread earned on client sweep cash. This past year, we completed approximately $6.5 billion in bulk transfers from money market funds to Schwab Bank, including $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter. These bulk transfers were supported by a combination of organic capital growth and our issuance of $600 million of preferred stock in the third quarter. In addition, we maintained and enhanced our balance sheet liquidity in 2015. We replaced $350 million of maturing debt with cost effective ten-year notes and also issued $1 billion of new long-term debt during the year, investing the majority in term Treasury Notes. We ended 2015 with a preliminary Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 7.1%. Overall, our 2015 results highlight the efficacy of Schwab’s financial model across a range of conditions.”
