“ONEOK ended 2015 in a strong financial position, benefiting from increased distributions related to our limited and general partner interests in ONEOK Partners,” said Terry K. Spencer, president and chief executive officer of ONEOK. “Distributions declared from the partnership increased more than 16 percent in 2015 compared with 2014, driven by ONEOK’s purchase of an additional 21.5 million ONEOK Partners units in August 2015.

“Despite a continued challenging environment, we remain confident in the partnership’s uniquely positioned assets, its ability to grow natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes and its expectation to continue increasing fee-based earnings,” said Spencer. “In 2015, ONEOK Partners took important steps to reduce commodity risk through initiatives such as contract restructuring in the Williston Basin and the completion of strategic capital-growth projects that will provide primarily fee-based earnings. 

“We expect to achieve our 2016 financial guidance, including our expectation to maintain dividend coverage of approximately 1.3 times and to have approximately $250 million of free cash flow after dividends and cash on hand available to support ONEOK Partners if needed,” added Spencer. 

FOURTH-QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2015 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 results were impacted positively by higher volumes and increased fee-based earnings at ONEOK Partners (NYSE: OKS). NGL volumes gathered and fractionated and natural gas volumes gathered and processed increased, compared with 2014 results, and fee-based earnings increased in the natural gas gathering and processing segment as a result of successful contract restructuring efforts. 

Unplanned outages related to ice storms in the Mid-Continent resulted in an approximately $4 million negative impact in the fourth quarter 2015 and sustained low commodity prices continued to impact the partnership throughout the year.

Fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 operating income reflect: 

•Higher NGL fee-based exchange-services volumes primarily from eight new natural gas processing plants connected in 2015; 

•Increases in the partnership’s NGL transportation business, primarily from the West Texas LPG pipeline system in the Permian Basin; 

•Higher natural gas volumes gathered and processed; and 

•Higher average fee rates from contract restructuring in the natural gas gathering and processing segment; partially offset by

•Lower net realized NGL, natural gas and condensate prices; and

•Noncash impairment charges primarily related to investments in the coal-bed methane area of the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. 

Operating costs increased for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 periods compared with the same periods in 2014 due primarily to completed capital-growth projects and acquisitions in the partnership’s natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments. 

Depreciation and amortization increased in the fourth-quarter and full-year 2015, compared with 2014, due to the growth of operations related to completed capital-growth projects and acquisitions. 

Equity in net earnings from investments increased for the full-year 2015, compared with 2014, due primarily to higher NGL volumes delivered to the Overland Pass Pipeline from the Bakken NGL Pipeline in 2015. 

ONEOK’s future cash payments associated with the released natural gas transportation and storage capacity from the former energy services segment are expected to total approximately $37 million, which consists of approximately $19 million in 2016; $10 million in 2017; $4 million in 2018; and $4 million over the period 2019 through 2023.

Natural Gas Liquids Segment

The natural gas liquids segment benefited from volume growth of NGLs gathered and fractionated during the fourth quarter and full-year 2015. NGLs transported on gathering lines increased more than 30 percent in the fourth quarter 2015 and nearly 44 percent for the full-year 2015, compared with the same periods in 2014, primarily due to increased Permian Basin volumes transported on the West Texas LPG pipeline system and increased volumes from eight new natural gas processing plants connected to ONEOK Partners’ system in 2015, including the fourth-quarter completion of Lonesome Creek. NGLs fractionated increased approximately 8 and 6 percent in the fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 periods, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2014.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The increase in fourth-quarter 2015 operating income, compared with the fourth quarter 2014, primarily reflects:

•A $63.1 million increase in fee-based exchange-services, resulting primarily from increased volumes from recently connected natural gas processing plants in the Williston Basin, Powder River Basin and Mid-Continent region, decreased ethane rejection in the Rocky Mountain region and the impact of minimum volume obligations; 

•A $14.7 million increase in the partnership’s transportation business, primarily from the West Texas LPG pipeline system in the Permian Basin; offset partially by 

•A $21.5 million decrease primarily from narrower NGL location and product price differentials and decreased marketing activities.

The increase in operating income for the full-year 2015, compared with 2014, primarily reflects: 

• A $191.0 million increase in fee-based exchange-services, resulting primarily from increased volumes from recently connected natural gas processing plants and higher revenues from customers with minimum volume obligations;

-more-

Page 6

•An $81.8 million increase in the segment’s transportation business, primarily from higher volumes on the West Texas LPG pipeline system; and 

•A $23.8 million increase resulting from decreased ethane rejection in the Williston Basin, offset partially by higher ethane rejection in the Mid-Continent region; offset partially by 

•A $118.4 million decrease in optimization, marketing and differentials-based activities due primarily to narrower NGL location and product price differentials. A portion of the decrease relates to the increased demand for propane in the first quarter 2014; and

•A $29.9 million decrease from lower isomerization volumes. 

Operating costs increased in the fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 periods, compared with 2014, due primarily to a $29.2 million increase from the West Texas LPG pipeline system acquisition.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 periods, compared with the same periods in 2014, due to completed capital-growth projects and acquisitions.

Equity in net earnings from investments decreased slightly in the fourth-quarter 2015 compared with the fourth quarter 2014 due to the timing of minimum volume commitment payments on the Overland Pass Pipeline in 2014. Full-year 2015 equity in net earnings from investments increased, compared with 2014, due primarily to higher volumes delivered to the Overland Pass Pipeline from the Bakken NGL Pipeline. 

Natural Gas Pipelines Segment 

The natural gas pipelines segment maintains primarily fee-based operations, with continued growth in the Permian Basin as the partnership continues construction of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission Pipeline joint venture and the WesTex Transmission Pipeline expansion. The first phase of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission Pipeline is expected to be complete in the first quarter 2016 and is fully subscribed under 25-year firm fee-based (take-or-pay) commitments. 

The segment expects its earnings to remain more than 95 percent fee-based in 2016, with approximately 92 percent of its transportation capacity and 76 percent of its natural gas storage capacity expected to be contracted for the year.

Variances in financial performance between 2015 results and 2014 results were primarily a reflection of significantly higher weather-related seasonal demand resulting in higher natural gas prices during the first quarter 2014. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth-quarter 2015 operating income decreased, compared with the fourth quarter 2014, which primarily reflects:

•A $10.4 million decrease due primarily to lower short-term natural gas storage services; offset partially by 

•A $2.7 million increase from higher transportation revenues primarily due to increased firm transportation. 

The decrease in operating income for the full-year 2015, compared with 2014, primarily reflects: 

•A $24.3 million decrease from lower short-term natural gas storage services, due primarily to increased weather-related seasonal demand associated with severely cold weather in the first quarter 2014; 

•A $10.0 million decrease from lower net retained fuel due to lower natural gas prices and lower natural gas volumes retained; and 

•A $5.0 million decrease from lower park-and-loan services on the segment’s interstate pipelines as a result of weather-related seasonal demand due to severely cold weather in the first quarter 2014; offset partially by

•An $8.6 million increase due to higher transportation revenues, primarily from increased rates on intrastate pipelines and higher rates on Viking Gas Transmission, offset partially by decreased interruptible transportation revenues from lower natural gas volumes transported.

Operating costs decreased for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 periods, compared with 2014, primarily as a result of lower costs for materials, supplies and outside services.

Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Segment

Completed capital-growth projects in the Williston Basin continue to drive volume growth in the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Full-year 2015 natural gas volumes gathered increased nearly 12 percent, and natural gas volumes processed increased approximately 10 percent, compared with 2014. Fourth-quarter natural gas volumes gathered and processed increased approximately 8 and 4 percent, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter 2014. 

Due to successful contract restructuring efforts, the segment’s fourth-quarter 2015 average fee rate increased to 55 cents, a more than 50 percent increase compared with the same period in 2014. Additionally, nearly 80 percent of the operating income impact realized in the fourth quarter from lower commodity prices was offset by higher average fee rates. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth-quarter 2015 operating income decreased, compared with the fourth quarter 2014, which primarily reflects: 

•A $73.7 million decrease due to noncash impairment charges primarily related to assets in the dry natural gas area of the Powder River Basin; 

•A $56.4 million decrease due primarily to lower net realized NGL, natural gas and condensate prices; and 

•A $5.8 million decrease due primarily to decreased ethane rejection in the Williston Basin to maintain downstream NGL product specifications; offset partially by 

•A $43.7 million increase due primarily to contract restructuring resulting in higher average fee rates and a lower percentage of proceeds retained from the sale of commodities under percent of proceeds (POP) with fee contracts; and 

•A $12.3 million increase due primarily to natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin, offset partially by decreased natural gas volumes in the Cana-Woodford Shale.

Operating income for the full-year 2015 decreased, compared with 2014, which primarily reflects:

•A $209.7 million decrease due primarily to lower net realized NGL, natural gas and condensate prices; 

•A $73.7 million decrease due to a noncash impairment charges related primarily to assets in the dry natural gas area of the Powder River Basin; and

•A $10.4 million decrease due primarily to decreased ethane rejection to maintain downstream NGL product specifications; offset partially by

•A $91.6 million increase due primarily to contract restructuring resulting in higher average fee rates and a lower percentage of proceeds retained from the sale of commodities under POP with fee contracts; and

•A $38.1 million increase due primarily to natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin, offset partially by unplanned operational outages in the Williston Basin and decreased natural gas volumes in the Cana-Woodford Shale. 

Operating costs and depreciation and amortization expense increased in the fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 periods, compared with the same periods in 2014, due primarily to completed capital-growth projects.

Equity in net earnings from investments decreased in 2015, compared with 2014, due to a $180.6 million noncash impairment charge in the fourth quarter 2015 related to ONEOK Partners’ equity investments primarily in the dry natural gas area of the Powder River Basin. In 2014, the segment recorded a $76.4 million noncash impairment charge related to an investment in the same area. 

The following table contains equity-volume information for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Although the partnership’s business is predominately fee based, the natural gas gathering and processing segment is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of percent-of-proceeds (POP) with fee contracts, where the segment receives commodities, or equity volumes, as a portion of its compensation for services. In 2015, the partnership restructured a portion of its POP with fee contracts to include significantly higher fees, which it expects will reduce equity volumes and the related commodity price exposure.

The partnership executes hedges to reduce its commodity price risk. NGLs hedged reflect propane, normal butane, iso-butane and natural gasoline only. The ethane component of the natural gas gathering and processing segment’s equity NGL volume is not expected to significantly impact the results of operations.

The following tables set forth hedging information for the natural gas gathering and processing segment’s forecasted equity volumes for the periods indicated: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

All of the natural gas gathering and processing segment’s commodity price sensitivities are estimated as a hypothetical change in the price of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil as of Dec. 31, 2015, excluding the effects of hedging and assuming normal operating conditions. Condensate sales are based on the price of crude oil. 

The natural gas gathering and processing segment estimates the following sensitivities, including the effects of hedging and assuming normal operating conditions, for the year ending Dec. 31, 2016:

•a $1.00-per-barrel change in the price of crude oil would change 12-month operating income by approximately $0.7 million; 

•a 1-cent-per-gallon change in the composite price of NGLs would change 12-month operating income by approximately $0.6 million; and

•a 10-cent-per-MMBtu change in the price of residue natural gas would change 12-month operating income by approximately $0.5 million.

These estimates do not include any effects on demand for ONEOK Partners’ services or natural gas processing plant operations that might be caused by, or arise in conjunction with, price changes. For example, a change in the gross processing spread may cause a change in the

NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURE:

ONEOK has disclosed in this news release cash flow available for dividends, free cash flow and dividend coverage ratio, which are non-GAAP financial metrics, used to measure the company’s financial performance and are defined as follows:

•Cash flow available for dividends is defined as net income less the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, adjusted for equity in earnings and distributions declared from ONEOK Partners, and ONEOK’s stand-alone depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, stand-alone capital expenditures and certain other items; 

•Free cash flow is defined as cash flow available for dividends, computed as described above, less ONEOK’s dividends declared; and

•Dividend coverage ratio is defined as cash flow available for dividends divided by the dividends declared for the period.

These non-GAAP financial measures described above are useful to investors because they are used by many companies in the industry as a measurement of financial performance and
