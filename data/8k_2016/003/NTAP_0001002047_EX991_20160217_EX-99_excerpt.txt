NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials 

The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes, when applicable, the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. The non-GAAP tax provision also excludes, when applicable, (a) tax charges or benefits in the current period that relate to one or more prior fiscal periods that are a result of events such as changes in tax legislation, authoritative guidance, income tax audit settlements, and/or court decisions, (b) tax charges or benefits that are attributable to unusual or non-reoccurring book and/or tax accounting method changes, (c) tax charges that are a result of a non-routine foreign cash repatriation, (d) tax charges or benefits that are a result of infrequent restructuring of the Company's tax structure, (e) tax charges or benefits that are a result of a change in valuation allowance, and (f) the impact of a temporary lapse of tax law, such as the federal research credit, if such extensions have routinely been granted based on past legislative history and are expected to be reinstated in the near future. Non-GAAP earnings per share is calculated using the diluted number of shares for all periods. 

We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has limitations and they should not solely be used to evaluate our Company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we provide non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. 

These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure Company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors' operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure Company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.
