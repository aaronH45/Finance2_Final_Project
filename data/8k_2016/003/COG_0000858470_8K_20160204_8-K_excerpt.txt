· reduce the minimum ratio of the present value of proved reserves to debt (the “Asset Coverage Ratio”) for two years; 

· increase the interest rate and commitment fees under the Credit Agreement under certain circumstances during such period; and 

· impose a maximum ratio of debt and other obligations to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, exploration and certain other expenses (the “Leverage Ratio”).

Also on February 4, 2016, the Company entered into amendments to each of the Note Purchase Agreements (collectively and as each may have been previously amended, the “Senior Note Agreement”) for each series of its issued and outstanding senior notes (the “Senior Notes”), effective December 31, 2015 (collectively, the “Senior Note Amendments”), amending the respective Agreements to, among other things: 

· calculate the present value of proved reserves, as used to determine the Asset Coverage Ratio, on a “before tax” basis; 

· reduce the minimum Asset Coverage Ratio for two years; 

· impose a maximum Leverage Ratio; and 

· provide for potential increases from time to time in the interest rate applicable to the Senior Notes ranging from 0 to 125 basis points, based upon the Asset Coverage Ratio and the Leverage Ratio in effect from time to time. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement and the Senior Note Agreements.
