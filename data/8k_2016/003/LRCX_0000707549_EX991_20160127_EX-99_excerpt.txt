Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Results

Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances increased to $4.7 billion at the end of the December 2015 quarter compared to $4.5 billion at the end of the September 2015 quarter. This increase was primarily the result of approximately $295 million in cash flows from operating activities which was partially offset by approximately $13 million of treasury stock repurchases related to net share settlement on employee stock-based compensation; approximately $28 million of capital expenditures; and approximately $48 million of dividends paid to stockholders during the December 2015 quarter.

Deferred revenue at the end of the December 2015 quarter decreased to $395 million as compared to $517 million at the end of the September 2015 quarter. Deferred profit at the end of the December 2015 quarter decreased to $261 million as compared to $325 million at the end of the September 2015 quarter. Lam’s deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The estimated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $109 million as of December 27, 2015.

The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the December 2015 quarter is shown in the following table:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The information provided above is only an estimate of what the Company believes is realizable as of the date of this release, and does not incorporate the potential impact of any KLA-Tencor related acquisition or integration expenses, business combinations, asset acquisitions, divestitures, financing arrangements, other investments, or other significant transactions that may be completed after the date of this release. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items provided include only those items that are known and can be estimated as of the date of this release. Actual results will vary from this model and the variations may be material. Reconciling items included above are as follows:

•Gross Margin - amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, $21 million.

•Operating margin - amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, $37 million.

•Earnings per share - amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, $37 million; amortization of note discounts, $9 million; amortization of bridge loan issuance costs associated with the KLA-Tencor acquisition, $18 million and associated tax benefit for non-GAAP items ($14) million; totaling $50 million.

•Diluted share count - impact of a note hedge issued contemporaneously with the convertible notes due 2016 and 2018, 2 million shares.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Results

In addition to U.S. GAAP results, this press release also contains non-GAAP financial results. The Company’s non-GAAP results for both the December 2015 and September 2015 quarters exclude amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, restructuring impacts, the amortization of notes discounts, and tax expense (benefit) of non-GAAP items. Additionally, the December 2015 quarter non-GAAP results exclude costs associated with the KLA-Tencor acquisition, amortization of bridge loan issuance costs associated with the KLA-Tencor acquisition, and income tax benefit from tax extenders primarily the research and development credit; and the September 2015 quarter non-GAAP results exclude cumulative income tax benefits due to a court ruling.

Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, operating income, operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company’s operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors’ ability to view the Company’s results from management’s perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company’s website at http://investor.lamresearch.com .
