Drilling Activity in the U.S. 

H&P’s U.S. Land Activity and Pricing Comments H&P’s U.S. Land segment has approximately 127 contracted rigs generating revenue as of January 6, 2016, down from 132 on December 9, 2015. Average FlexRig spot pricing is down by more than 30%, as compared to spot pricing at the peak in November 2014. Since the start of the downturn in late-2014, H&P’s U.S. Land segment has received early termination notices for 73 rigs working under long-term contracts, up 12 from 61 at December 9, 2015. The 12 most recent early terminations are expected to generate total compensation fee revenues of approximately $144 million (see footnotes on Term Contract slides for details). Four of the 12 rigs are already idle.

H&P Global Fleet Under Term Contract Strong Backlog The above term contract coverage excludes long-term contracts for which the Company received early contract termination notifications as of 1/6/16. Given notifications as of 1/6/16, the Company expects to generate approximately $29 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2016, approximately $147 million during the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2016, and over $39 million thereafter from early terminations corresponding to long-term contracts. All of the above rig contracts include provisions for early termination fees. Some of the new build deliveries may be delayed in exchange for compensation from customers, but the corresponding total backlog would remain the same or potentially increase. Mutually beneficial renegotiations of some long-term contracts for active rigs are expected to extend the timing of those contracts beyond what is reflected above. *

H&P Customer Credit Ratings * As of September 30, 2015. Consists of 145 contracted U.S. Land rigs, 8 contracted Offshore rigs, and 15 contracted International Land rigs. Includes approximately 48 customers with active/contracted H&P rigs. ** The figures above represent H&P’s customer commitments for term contract work at the beginning of the first fiscal quarter (October 1, 2015). The value of the H&P backlog was expected to continue to decline during the first fiscal quarter as the Company earned the corresponding income during the quarter through operations or through early contract termination fees.

Ongoing U.S. Land Market Trends Unconventional plays continue to shape the landscape. AC drive rigs are best suited for more complex horizontal drilling. Customers continue to focus on drilling efficiency, technology and safety. Multiple wells being drilled from a single pad. The replacement cycle is expected to continue.
