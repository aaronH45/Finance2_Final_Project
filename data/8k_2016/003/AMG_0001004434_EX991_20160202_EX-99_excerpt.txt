“Notwithstanding declines in global equity markets in 2015, AMG generated strong Economic earnings per share, including $3.61 for the fourth quarter and $12.55 for the full year, representing year-over-year earnings growth of 10%,” stated Sean M. Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AMG. “AMG’s record earnings in 2015 included $691 million in Economic net income and nearly $1 billion in EBITDA. Against a challenging market backdrop in the second half of the year, our results reflect the diversity of our business and the successful execution of our growth strategy, including the long-term investment outperformance of our Affiliates and significant deployment of capital through our new investments strategy. Through the addition of six outstanding new Affiliates, we have meaningfully increased the earnings power of our business, further enhanced the breadth of our return-oriented products and the global footprint of our Affiliates, and deepened our exposure to some of the most attractive areas of the asset management industry.” 

“Our fourth quarter net client cash flows were impacted by elevated retail outflows, which were due to a combination of broader industry trends and one-off events, including a fund closure at an Affiliate. Net flows were positive for the institutional and high net worth channels, despite large idiosyncratic redemptions from a small number of institutional clients,” Mr. Healey continued. “Looking ahead, however, in spite of ongoing market volatility we continue to see substantial client interest in our Affiliates’ strategies, particularly across AMG’s areas of strategic focus, global equities and alternatives, where we have a strong book of prospective new business and excellent investment performance across our Affiliates.” 

“We were very pleased with the successful execution of our new investments strategy during the year, with the addition of an exceptional group of traditional, alternative, and wealth management Affiliates — including Systematica, Ivory, Abax, myCIO, and Baker Street in 2015, as well as the recent announcement of our partnership with Baring Asia, the largest dedicated Asian private equity firm,” Mr. Healey remarked. “These transactions generated meaningful earnings accretion while further diversifying our return-oriented product set. Going forward, we continue to have an excellent pipeline of new investments, including both traditional and alternative firms globally.” 

“Looking ahead, even in the midst of a volatile market environment, we are well-positioned to continue to generate strong long-term earnings growth and meaningful additional shareholder value through the execution of our business strategy,” Mr. Healey concluded. “We have outstanding scale and diversity across attractive product areas, high-quality Affiliates with excellent long-term performance track records, a global distribution strategy which gives our boutique partners a competitive advantage in gathering assets around the world, and a unique opportunity to make accretive investments in new Affiliates.”

Notes 

(in millions) 

(A) Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of intangible amortization (including equity method intangible amortization) and impairments, deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items which include non-cash imputed interest (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expenses. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) an important measure of our financial performance, as we believe it best represents operating performance before our share of non-cash expenses relating to the acquisition of interests in our affiliated investment management firms, and it is therefore employed as our principal performance benchmark. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or any other GAAP measure of financial performance or liquidity. 

We add back intangible amortization and impairments attributable to acquired client relationships because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in the value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. We add back non-cash imputed interest and reductions or increases in contingent payment arrangements because it better reflects our contractual interest obligations. We add back non-cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between Affiliate partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders. 

(B) EBITDA (controlling interest) represents our performance before our share of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that many investors use this information when comparing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. EBITDA (controlling interest), as calculated by us, may not be consistent with computations of EBITDA by other companies. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or any other GAAP measure of financial performance or liquidity. 

(C) Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of the convertible securities in excess of par, if any, are deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion. Economic earnings per share is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Earnings per share (diluted) or any other GAAP measure of financial performance. 

(D) We completed our investments in myCIO Wealth Partners, LLC, Ivory Investment Management, L.P. and Abax Investments (Pty) Ltd in the fourth quarter of 2015; and we completed our investment in Baker Street Advisors, LLC in the second quarter of 2015. 

(E) Includes ($2.2) billion in net client cash outflows associated with Third Avenue Management including all of the remaining assets under management in the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund.

(F) In the first and second quarters of 2015, we adjusted our estimate of our contingent payment obligations and, accordingly, reported gains attributable to the controlling interest of $29.8 ($18.5 net of tax) and $15.0 ($9.3 net of tax), respectively. 

(G) Our consolidated income tax provision includes taxes attributable to the controlling interest, and to a lesser extent, taxes attributable to non-controlling interests, as follows:
