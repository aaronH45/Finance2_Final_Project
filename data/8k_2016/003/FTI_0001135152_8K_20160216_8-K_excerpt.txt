99.1News Release issued by FMC Technologies, Inc. dated February 16, 2016

Exhibit 99.1 to this report contains three "non-GAAP financial measures", as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Numerical reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") are included in Exhibit 99.1. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures included in Exhibit 99.1 are:

(1) Net income attributable to FMC Technologies, Inc., excluding charges and credits

Net income attributable to FMC Technologies, Inc., excluding charges and credits is a non-GAAP financial measure reflecting net income attributable to FMC Technologies excluding certain charges and credits incurred during the reporting period. We believe net income attributable to FMC Technologies, Inc., excluding charges and credits, is a meaningful financial measure useful to investors to assess our consolidated results of operations by understanding certain significant items impacting the comparability of our results. Management analyzes the consolidated results of operations by excluding these items to identify underlying trends and as an indicator of overall performance.

(2) Net debt

Net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure reflecting debt, net of cash and cash equivalents. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate our capital structure and financial leverage. We believe net debt is a meaningful financial measure that may assist investors in understanding our financial condition and recognizing underlying trends in our capital structure.

(3) Segment operating profit, excluding charges

Segment operating profit, excluding charges is a non-GAAP financial measure reflecting segment operating profit excluding certain charges incurred during the reporting period. We believe segment operating profit, excluding charges is a meaningful financial measure useful to investors to assess our segment results of operations by understanding certain significant items impacting the comparability of our segment results. Management analyzes the segment results of operations by excluding these items to identify underlying trends and as an indicator of segment performance.
