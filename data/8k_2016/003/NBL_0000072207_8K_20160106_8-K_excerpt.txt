Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  

On January 6, 2016, Noble Energy, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a term loan agreement with Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”), as administrative agent, Mizuho Bank, Ltd. (“Mizuho”), as syndication agent, and certain other financial institutions party thereto (the “Term Loan Agreement”), which provides for a new three-year term loan facility in a principal amount of up to $1.4 billion. The loans drawn under the Term Loan Agreement (collectively, the “Term Loans”) will be used by the Company to fund the purchase of certain outstanding senior notes pursuant to the cash tender offers described below and the payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the tender offers and the Term Loan Agreement. If the aggregate amount of the Term Loans drawn by the Company for such purposes is less than $1.4 billion, then the remaining commitments under the Term Loan Agreement will be terminated.  

The Term Loans will accrue interest, at the Company’s option, at either (a) a base rate equal to the highest of (i) the rate announced by Citibank, N.A., as its prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) a London interbank offered rate plus 1.0%, plus a margin that ranges from 10 basis points to 75 basis points depending upon the Company’s credit rating, or (b) a London interbank offered rate, plus a margin that ranges from 100 basis points to 175 basis points depending upon the Company’s credit rating.  

The Term Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are consistent with those contained in the Company’s existing $4.0 billion revolving credit facility. The Term Loan Agreement requires that the Company’s total debt to capitalization ratio, expressed as a percentage, not exceed 65 percent at any time. A violation of this covenant would result in a default under the Term Loan Agreement, which could require the immediate repayment of the Term Loans. The Term Loans may be pre-paid in full or in part at any time prior to its maturity without premium.  

Certain lenders that are a party to the Term Loan Agreement have in the past performed, and may in the future from time to time perform, investment banking, financial advisory, lending or commercial banking services for the Company and its subsidiaries, for which they have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation and reimbursement of expenses. Affiliates of Citibank and Mizuho are acting as dealer managers in connection with the tender offers described below.  

The foregoing description of the material terms and conditions of the Term Loan Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Term Loan Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
