Cimarex Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2015 Results 

- 2015 Capex down 53% from 2014 levels 

- Full-year Production up 13% to 985 MMcfe per day

DENVER, Feb. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Cimarex Energy Co. (NYSE: XEC) today reported a fourth quarter 2015 net loss of $630.5 million, or $6.78 per share. The adjusted fourth quarter net loss was $23.0 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to fourth-quarter 2014 adjusted net income of $76.4 million, or $0.87 per diluted share(1). For the year, Cimarex recorded a net loss of $2.4 billion, or $25.92 per share. The adjusted net loss for the full year was $0.60 per share(1). Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $744 million in 2015, a 54 percent drop from 2014 levels(1). Revenues in 2015 totaled $1.5 billion, a 40 percent decrease from 2014. The decrease in revenues, earnings and cash flow was the result of substantially lower product prices received. (See table of Average Realized Price by Region below.)

Total company production volumes averaged 986 million cubic feet equivalent (MMcfe) per day in the fourth quarter, up four percent from a year ago. Weather and facilities disruptions negatively impacted fourth quarter production by approximately 30 MMcfe per day. For the full year, Cimarex reported daily production volumes of 985 MMcfe per day, up 13 percent from our 2014 average daily output of 869 MMcfe per day. 

Cimarex invested $877 million in exploration and development in 2015. This was down significantly from the amount Cimarex invested in 2014 when E&D capital investment totaled $1.9 billion. Investments made in 2015 were funded with cash flow and cash on hand.

Proved reserves at December 31, 2015 were 2.9 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), down seven percent year over year. Cimarex added 429 Bcfe through extensions and discoveries and had 142 Bcfe in net performance revisions. As a result, the company replaced 159 percent of 2015 production (excludes negative price and operating cost revisions of 399 Bcfe and 19 Bcfe, respectively). Proved reserves are 75 percent proved developed. Prices used for 2015 proved reserve reporting for oil, gas and NGLs were down 47 percent, 40 percent and 53 percent, respectively, from 2014. (See table of Proved Reserves below.)

Continued declines in oil and natural gas prices impacted the company's financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year. Realized oil prices averaged $37.32 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $43.38 per barrel for the full year, down 43 percent and 48 percent, versus the respective periods a year ago. In the fourth quarter, natural gas prices averaged $2.20 per Mcf and NGL prices averaged $12.72 per barrel compared to $3.95 and $25.32, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, natural gas prices averaged $2.53 per Mcf and NGL prices averaged $13.75 per barrel compared to $4.43 and $33.14, respectively, in 2014. Total debt at December 31, 2015 consisted of $1.5 billion of long-term notes, with $750 million maturing in 2022 and $750 million maturing in 2024. Cimarex had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility and had a cash balance of $779 million. Debt was 35 percent of total capitalization(2).

Permian Basin

Production from the Permian Basin averaged 520 MMcfe per day in the fourth quarter, a 16 percent increase over fourth-quarter 2014 and a decrease of eight percent sequentially. Quarterly oil volumes averaged 38,423 barrels per day, flat year-over-year, and accounted for 44 percent of the region's total production for the quarter. 

Cimarex completed and brought on production 13 gross (eight net) Permian Basin wells during the fourth quarter, bringing the total for 2015 to 85 gross (60 net) wells. 

One highlight of the 2015 Permian program was the drilling and completion of 19 gross (13 net) New Mexico Bone Spring wells. Average 30-day gross peak production from these wells was 1,404 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day (63 percent oil). 

In Culberson County, Texas, Cimarex has completed 27 long lateral Wolfcamp wells to date including 18 in the Wolfcamp D (Lower Wolfcamp) and nine in the Wolfcamp A (Upper Wolfcamp). Of note were two 7,500-foot Upper Wolfcamp laterals completed during the fourth quarter using a larger stimulation. Average 30-day gross peak production from these two wells was 1,879 BOE per day (51 percent oil, 30 percent gas, 19 percent NGL).

Mid-Continent

Cimarex drilled and completed 134 gross (39 net) wells in the Mid-Continent area in 2015. The majority of the activity was in the Cana-Woodford and Meramec shale plays in western Oklahoma. At the end of the fourth quarter, 37 gross (13 net) wells were awaiting completion; 30 gross (10 net) Cana-Woodford wells and seven gross (three net) Meramec wells. Mid-Continent production averaged 461.1 MMcfe per day for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 432.4 MMcfe per day for the full year.

Cimarex completed its second 10,000-foot lateral well in the Meramec formation in the fourth quarter. Initial gross 30-day peak production from the first two long lateral Meramec wells averaged 15.0 MMcfe per day (53 percent gas, 24 percent oil, 23 percent NGL). A third Meramec long lateral is flowing back. In addition, Cimarex now has 17 5,000-foot Meramec wells on production that have an average 30-day initial peak production rate of 8.4 MMcfe per day (33 percent oil, 44 percent gas, 23 percent NGL) with oil yields ranging from 11 bbl/MMcf to 486 bbl/MMcf.

Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share excludes the noted item because management believes this item affects the comparability of operating results. The company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures as a useful adjunct to GAAP earnings because:

 a) Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the company's operational trends and performance relative to other oil and gas exploration and production companies.

 b) Adjusted net income (loss) is more comparable to earnings estimates provided by research analysts.

*Earnings (loss) per share are based on actual figures rather than the rounded figures presented

**Participating securities and other dilutive shares are not included in the diluted share computation when a loss exists.

Management believes that the non-GAAP measure of adjusted cash flow from operations is useful information for investors because it is used internally and is accepted by the investment community as a means of measuring the company's ability to fund its capital program and dividends, without fluctuations caused by changes in current assets and liabilities, which are included in the GAAP measure of cash flow from operating activities. It is also used by professional research analysts in providing investment recommendations pertaining to companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.

*Pre-tax PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV-10 is comparable to the standardized measure, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV-10 is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure but without deducting future income taxes. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, Cimarex's discounted future income taxes were $344.9 million and $2,036.6 million, respectively. Cimarex's standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was $1,934.1 million at year-end 2015 and $4,352.8 million at year-end 2014. Cimarex believes pre-tax PV-10 is a useful measure for investors for evaluating the relative monetary significance of its oil and natural gas properties. Cimarex further believes investors may utilize its pre-tax PV-10 as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of its reserves to other companies because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid. However, pre-tax PV-10 is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. Cimarex's pre-tax PV-10 and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of its oil and natural gas reserves.

*At December 31, 2015, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The requirements are to be applied retrospectively to prior periods presented. These changes resulted in classifying debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability (except for those related to revolving credit facilities), rather than as an asset. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, other assets, net and long-term debt are reduced by $14,380 and $16,824, respectively. The adoption of this ASU did not impact the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) or the Cash Flow Statements.
