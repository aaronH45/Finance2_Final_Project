AES Reports 2015 Proportional Free Cash Flow of $1,241 Million and Adjusted EPS of $1.22

2015 Achievements

•Increased quarterly dividend by 10%, to $0.11 per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2016

•Returned $757 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments

•Used $345 million to prepay or refinance Parent debt

•Brought on-line 1,484 MW of new projects, with an additional 5,620 MW currently under construction, the majority of which is expected to come on-line through 2018

•Advanced select platform expansion projects in the Philippines, Panama and California

2016 Guidance and 2017-2018 Expectations

•Revised 2016 Proportional Free Cash Flow guidance to $1,000-$1,350 million, $125 million below prior guidance; continues to expect at least 10% average annual growth in 2017 and 2018

•Revised 2016 Adjusted EPS guidance to $0.95-$1.05, $0.10 below prior guidance; now expects average annual growth in 2017 and 2018 in the higher end of the prior 12%-16% range

•Revised 2016 guidance primarily reflects the impact from continued devaluation in foreign currencies and commodities, as well as slower economic growth in Brazil

ARLINGTON, Va., February 24, 2016 – The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today reported Proportional Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) for full year 2015 of $1,241 million, an increase of $350 million from full year 2014. Although operating results were down year-over-year, Proportional Free Cash Flow improved primarily as a result of improved collections, particularly in the Dominican Republic and in Chile. Full year 2015 Consolidated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities increased $343 million to $2,134 million, primarily driven by the same factors as Proportional Free Cash Flow.

Full year 2015 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure) decreased $0.08 to $1.22, primarily due to the $0.11 impact from the devaluation in foreign currencies in Latin America and Europe, the impact of lower commodity prices, as well as lower demand in Brazil. These negative impacts were partially offset by a 6% reduction in share count, lower Parent interest expense, improved hydrological conditions in Panama and the contributions from new plants coming on-line, including Mong Duong in Vietnam. 

Full year 2015 Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations was $0.44, a decrease of $0.65 from full year 2014. In addition to the factors impacting Adjusted EPS described above, Diluted EPS also reflects lower gains from sales of businesses and higher impairment expense, partially offset by lower debt extinguishment expense. 

"Despite facing significant macroeconomic headwinds in 2015, we delivered strong free cash flow growth, continued to de-lever the company, repurchased $500 million of our shares and advanced our platform expansion projects," said Andrés Gluski, AES President and Chief Executive Officer. "Based on our strong

Proportional Free Cash Flow growth of almost 40%, for the third consecutive year we raised our dividend by at least 10%. We also brought on-line 1,500 MW of new capacity and our additional 6 GW of largely funded, on-going construction projects will drive our expected 10% growth in free cash flow through 2018."

"We are obviously disappointed that the adverse macroeconomic conditions, specifically declines in foreign currencies and commodities and the recession in Brazil, continue to have an impact on our financial outlook," said Tom O'Flynn, AES Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "That said, we continue to partially offset these headwinds through our hedging activities and other steps, including a three-year cost reduction and revenue enhancement program from which we expect to realize an annual run rate benefit of $150 million. We will continue to prudently allocate our capital to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders."

Fourth quarter 2015 Proportional Free Cash Flow increased $6 million to $293 million and Fourth quarter 2015 Adjusted PTC decreased $59 million to $325 million. Key drivers of this improvement included:

•US

◦Proportional Free Cash Flow decreased $30 million, primarily driven by: 

▪Lower margins: lower availability and a greater proportion of energy sold into the wholesale versus retail market at DPL and lower wholesale margins and the impact of the partial sell-down at IPL; and

▪DPL: higher capital expenditures and lower collections, partially offset by a one-time contract termination payment in 2014;

▪Partially offset by lower capital expenditures and higher collections at IPL.

◦Adjusted PTC decreased $37 million, primarily due to lower margins. 

•Andes

◦Proportional Free Cash Flow increased $43 million, primarily driven by:

▪Higher margins: higher energy prices at Chivor in Colombia and lower depreciation and lower fixed costs at Gener in Chile, offset by an approximate 29% devaluation of the Colombian Peso; and

▪Lower margins: lower demand and increased storm costs at Sul, higher fixed costs and lower demand at Eletropaulo and the 34% devaluation of the Brazilian Real, partially offset by lower spot energy purchases at lower prices at Tiete.

◦Adjusted PTC decreased $52 million, primarily due to lower margins and higher provisions for bad debt at Sul.

•Mexico, Central America & the Caribbean (MCAC)

◦Proportional Free Cash Flow decreased of $44 million, primarily driven by: 

▪Lower margins: timing of spot gas cargoes in 2015 in the Dominican Republic; and

◦Adjusted PTC increased $11 million, primarily due to compensation related to the early termination of a PPA in Panama, where a new PPA is now in place, offset by lower margins.

•Europe

◦Proportional Free Cash Flow increased $1 million, primarily driven by: 

▪Lower margins: the 40% devaluation of the Kazakhstan Tenge, the 12% devaluation of the Euro, the timing of outages at Ballylumford in the United Kingdom in 2014, the sale of Ebute in Nigeria in 2014, partially offset by the timing of outages at Kilroot in the United Kingdom; 

▪Offset by higher collections at Maritza in Bulgaria.

◦Adjusted PTC decreased $17 million, due to lower margins, partially offset by lower depreciation at Kilroot in the United Kingdom.

•Asia

◦Proportional Free Cash Flow increased $12 million, primarily driven by:

▪Higher margins: the commencement of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam.

◦Adjusted PTC increased $17 million, primarily due to higher margins.

•Corp/Other

◦Proportional Free Cash Flow increased $42 million, primarily driven by lower Parent interest expense in 2015 and swap termination payments in 2014.

◦Adjusted PTC decreased $85 million, primarily driven by lower margins.

•Andes

◦Proportional Free Cash Flow increased $48 million, primarily driven by: 

▪Higher margins: improved availability in Chile and higher energy prices at Chivor in Colombia, offset by the 27% devaluation of the Colombian Peso; and

(1) Free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as net cash from operating activities excluding capital expenditures related to service concession assets, less maintenance capital expenditures (including non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures), net of reinsurance proceeds from third parties. AES believes that free cash flow is a useful measure for evaluating our financial condition because it represents the amount of cash provided by operations less maintenance capital expenditures as defined by our businesses, that may be available for investing or for repaying debt.

(2) AES is a holding company that derives its income and cash flows from the activities of its subsidiaries, some of which may not be wholly-owned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company has presented certain financial metrics which are defined as Proportional (a non-GAAP financial measure). Proportional metrics present the Company's estimate of its share in the economics of the underlying metric. The Company believes that the Proportional metrics are useful to investors because they exclude the economic share in the metric presented that is held by non-AES shareholders. For example, Net Cash from Operating Activities (Operating Cash Flow) is a GAAP metric which presents the Company's cash flow from operations on a consolidated basis, including operating cash flow allocable to noncontrolling interests. Proportional Operating Cash Flow removes the share of operating cash flow allocable to noncontrolling interests and

therefore may act as an aid in the valuation of the Company. Proportional metrics are reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure. Certain assumptions have been made to estimate our proportional financial measures. These assumptions include: (i) the Company's economic interest has been calculated based on a blended rate for each consolidated business when such business represents multiple legal entities; (ii) the Company's economic interest may differ from the percentage implied by the recorded net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests or dividends paid during a given period; (iii) the Company's economic interest for entities accounted for using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method is 100%; (iv) individual operating performance of the Company's equity method investments is not reflected and (v) inter-segment transactions are included as applicable for the metric presented.

(3) The proportional adjustment factor, proportional maintenance capital expenditures (net of reinsurance proceeds) and proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures are calculated by multiplying the percentage owned by noncontrolling interests for each entity by its corresponding consolidated cash flow metric and are totaled to the resulting figures. For example, Parent Company A owns 20% of Subsidiary Company B, a consolidated subsidiary. Thus, Subsidiary Company B has an 80% noncontrolling interest. Assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $100 from Subsidiary B, the proportional adjustment factor for Subsidiary B would equal $80 (or $100 x 80%). The Company calculates the proportional adjustment factor for each consolidated business in this manner and then sums these amounts to determine the total proportional adjustment factor used in the reconciliation. The proportional adjustment factor may differ from the proportion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of (a) non-cash items which impact income but not cash and (b) AES' ownership interest in the subsidiary where such items occur. 

(4) Service concession asset expenditures excluded from free cash flow and proportional free cash flow non-GAAP metrics.

(5) Excludes IPALCO’s proportional recoverable environmental capital expenditures of $84 million and $42 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, as well as, $205 million and $163 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.

(6) Includes proportional adjustment amount for service concession asset expenditures of $8 million and $84 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The Company adopted service concession accounting effective January 1, 2015.

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTION (PTC) AND ADJUSTED EPS

Adjusted Pre-Tax Contribution (“Adjusted PTC”) and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (“Adjusted EPS”) are non-GAAP supplemental measures that are used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as investors, industry analysts and lenders.

We define Adjusted PTC as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to AES excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis.

We define Adjusted EPS as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt.

The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to AES. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company and are considered in the Company’s internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, for Adjusted PTC, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS should not be construed as alternatives to income from continuing operations attributable to AES and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which are determined in accordance with GAAP.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Subsidiary distributions should not be construed as an alternative to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities which are determined in accordance with GAAP. Subsidiary distributions are important to the Parent Company because the Parent Company is a holding company that does not derive any significant direct revenues from its own activities but instead relies on its subsidiaries’ business activities and the resultant distributions to fund the debt service, investment and other cash needs of the holding company. The reconciliation of the difference between the subsidiary distributions and the Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities consists of cash generated from operating activities that is retained at the subsidiaries for a variety of reasons which are both discretionary and non-discretionary in nature. These factors include, but are not limited to, retention of cash to fund capital expenditures at the subsidiary, cash retention associated with non-recourse debt covenant restrictions and related debt service requirements at the subsidiaries, retention of cash related to sufficiency of local GAAP statutory retained earnings at the subsidiaries, retention of cash for working capital needs at the subsidiaries, and other similar timing differences between when the cash is generated at the subsidiaries and when it reaches the Parent Company and related holding companies.

(2) Parent Company Liquidity is defined as cash at the Parent Company plus availability under corporate credit facilities plus cash at qualified holding companies (QHCs). AES believes that unconsolidated Parent Company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent Company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES’s indebtedness.

(3) The cash held at QHCs represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US. Such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the Parent Company. Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US. These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the US. Since the cash held by these QHCs is available to the Parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to Parent and QHCs as a useful measure of cash available to the Parent to meet its international liquidity needs.

2015 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE ELEMENTS(1), (2) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) 2015 Guidance is based on expectations for future foreign exchange rates and commodity prices as of September 30, 2015. 

(2) AES is a holding company that derives its income and cash flows from the activities of its subsidiaries, some of which may not be wholly-owned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company has presented certain financial metrics which are defined as Proportional (a non-GAAP financial measure). Proportional metrics present the Company's estimate of its share in the economics of the underlying metric. The Company believes that the Proportional metrics are useful to investors because they exclude the economic share in the metric presented that is held by non-AES shareholders. For example, Net Cash from Operating Activities (Operating Cash Flow) is a GAAP metric which presents the Company's cash flow from operations on a consolidated basis, including operating cash flow allocable to noncontrolling interests. Proportional Operating Cash Flow removes the share of operating cash flow allocable to noncontrolling interests and therefore may act as an aid in the valuation of the Company. Beginning in Q1 2015, the definition was revised to also exclude cash flows related to service concession assets. Proportional metrics are reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure. Certain assumptions have been made to estimate our proportional financial measures. These assumptions include: (i) the Company's economic interest has been calculated based on a blended rate for each consolidated business when such business represents multiple legal entities; (ii) the Company's economic interest may differ from the percentage implied by the recorded net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests or dividends paid during a given period; (iii) the Company's economic interest for entities accounted for using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method is 100%; (iv) individual operating performance of the Company's equity method investments is not reflected and (v) inter-segment transactions are included as applicable for the metric presented.

(3) Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. AES believes that adjusted earnings per share better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company, and is considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. Adjusted earnings per share should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.

(4) Free Cash Flow is reconciled above. Free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as net cash from operating activities excluding capital expenditures related to service concession assets, less maintenance capital expenditures (including non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures), net of reinsurance proceeds from third parties. AES believes that free cash flow is a useful measure for evaluating our financial condition because it represents the amount of cash provided by operations less maintenance capital expenditures as defined by our businesses, that may be available for investing or for repaying debt.

These assumptions include: (i) the Company's economic interest has been calculated based on a blended rate for each consolidated business when such business represents multiple legal entities; (ii) the Company's economic interest may differ from the percentage implied by the recorded net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests or dividends paid during a given period; (iii) the Company's economic interest for entities accounted for using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method is 100%; (iv) individual operating performance of the Company's equity method investments is not reflected and (v) inter-segment transactions are included as applicable for the metric presented.

(2) 2016 Guidance as of November 5, 2015 is based on expectations for future foreign exchange rates and commodity prices as of October 15, 2015. 2016 Guidance as of February 24, 2016 is based on expectations for future foreign exchange rates and commodity prices as of January 31, 2015.

(3) Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. AES believes that adjusted earnings per share better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company, and is considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. Adjusted earnings per share should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.

(4) Free Cash Flow is reconciled above. Free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as net cash from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures (including non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures), net of reinsurance proceeds from third parties. AES believes that free cash flow is a useful measure for evaluating our financial condition because it represents the amount of cash provided by operations less maintenance capital expenditures as defined by our businesses, that may be available for investing or for repaying debt.
