SECTION 5. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT.  

 Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

On February 8, 2016, the Management Development and Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of International Paper Company (the “Company”) adopted the Company’s 2016 Management Incentive Plan (the “2016 MIP”), the Company’s annual, cash-based incentive compensation plan. The 2016 MIP reflects a change to the Company performance metrics and their relative weighting from the prior-year plan: 70% Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) (from 50% Cash Flow from Operations); and 30% Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”) (from 50% ROIC). All other aspects of the 2016 MIP remain materially consistent with the prior-year plan. The 2016 MIP is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.  

 Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.  

On February 9, 2016, the Board of the Company adopted an amendment to the Company’s By-Laws, effective immediately, to implement proxy access for eligible stockholders.  

Article II, Section 10 was added to the By-Laws to permit a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, that has owned at least 3% of the Company’s outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials up to the greater of two directors and 20% of the number of the Company’s directors then in office, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the By-Laws. The By-Laws were also amended to make certain other technical and conforming revisions.  

The foregoing description of the amendment to the Company’s By-Laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Company’s By-Laws, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and are incorporated herein by reference.
