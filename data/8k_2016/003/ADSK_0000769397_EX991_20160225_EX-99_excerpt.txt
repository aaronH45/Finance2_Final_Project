"We had a terrific fourth quarter and our results demonstrate that our business model transition is working. Broad-based demand also led to better than expected subscription additions in the fourth quarter with new model offerings representing well over half of the subscriptions," said Carl Bass, Autodesk president and CEO. "Strong demand also fueled double-digit growth in ARR, deferred revenue, and billings, and we booked a record number of large transactions. As planned, we ended sales of perpetual licenses of individual products at the end of the quarter. We were particularly encouraged that only a small portion of total unit volume was related to this final opportunity to purchase these perpetual licenses.” 

Bass continued, “We’re starting fiscal 2017 from a position of strength. An increasing number of designers and engineers are subscribing to Autodesk’s portfolio and our recent restructuring allows us to accelerate investments in the transition while simultaneously reducing our spend growth. Looking forward, fiscal 2017 will be the most unique in the company’s history as we transition from selling perpetual licenses to subscriptions. The business model transition is broadening our addressable market and advancing our market leadership position. As such, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term targets and ultimately drive long-term value creation for our shareholders with a much more predictable and profitable business.” 

Fourth Quarter Operational Overview

Autodesk is undergoing a business model transition in which the company will discontinue selling new perpetual licenses in favor of subscriptions and flexible license arrangements. During the transition, billings, revenue, gross margin, operating margin, EPS, deferred revenue, and cash flow from operations will be impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than up front and as new offerings bring a wider variety of price points. 

Total subscriptions were 2.58 million, an increase of approximately 109,000 from the third quarter of fiscal 2016. New model subscriptions (Desktop, enterprise flexible license, and cloud subscription) were 427,000, an increase of 62,000 from the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase in new model subscriptions was led by Desktop subscriptions. Maintenance subscriptions were 2.15 million, an increase of 47,000 from the third quarter of fiscal 2016. 

Total ARR for the fourth quarter increased 10 percent to $1.38 billion compared to the fourth quarter last year as reported, and 12 percent on a constant currency basis. New model ARR was $255 million and increased 68 percent compared to the fourth quarter last year as reported, and 74 percent on a constant currency basis. Maintenance ARR was $1.12 billion and increased 2 percent compared to the fourth quarter last year as reported, and 4 percent on a constant currency basis.
