N O T E S Notes on non-GAAP financial measures 1. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm’s results and the results of the lines of business on a “managed” basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business 2. Adjusted expense and adjusted overhead ratio are each non-GAAP financial measures, and exclude firmwide legal expense. Management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provides an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance 3. Common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital, Total capital, risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) and the CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios and the supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) under the Basel III Fully Phased-In capital rules to which the Firm will be subject as of January 1, 2019, are each non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are used by management, bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Firm’s capital position. For additional information on these measures, see Regulatory capital in the Capital Management section of Management’s discussion and analysis within JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 4. Tangible common equity (“TCE”), return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s earnings as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period- end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity 40

Includes acquisition of commercial term lending portfolio through WaMu acquisition 8. The “mutual funds with a 4/5 star rating” analysis is sourced from Morningstar for all funds with the exception of Japan-domiciled funds; Nomura was used for Japan-domiciled funds. The analysis includes both Global Investment Management and Global Wealth Management open-ended funds that are rated by the aforementioned sources. The share class with the highest Morningstar star rating represents its respective fund. The Nomura star rating represents the aggregate fund. Other share classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings; the highest rated share class may not be available to all investors. All star ratings sourced from Morningstar reflect the Morningstar Overall RatingTM. For Japan-domiciled funds, the star rating is based on the Nomura 3-year star rating. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated by Morningstar nor Nomura and hence excluded from this analysis. Other funds which do not have a rating are also excluded from this analysis. Ratings are based on past performance and are not indicative of future results 9. Strategic Insight 10.

The sources of these percentile rankings, peer category definitions for each fund and the asset values used in the calculations are: Lipper (U.S. and Taiwan-domiciled funds), Morningstar (UK, Luxembourg and Hong Kong-domiciled funds), Nomura (Japan-domiciled funds), and FundDoctor (South Korea-domiciled funds). The analysis includes only Global Investment Management retail open-ended mutual funds that are ranked by the aforementioned sources. The analysis is based on percentile rankings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, at the ‘primary share class’ level for Luxembourg, UK, and Hong Kong-domiciled funds and at the aggregate fund level for all other funds. The ‘primary share class’ is defined by Morningstar and denotes the share class considered the best proxy for the fund. Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one 'primary share class' territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to ‘Offshore Territories’ and ‘HK SFC Authorized’ funds only). The analysis excludes money market funds, Undiscovered Managers Fund, and Brazil and India-domiciled funds. The asset values were redenominated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates from the aforementioned sources. The analysis pertains to percentage of assets under management, not percentage of funds. The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future performance, which may vary 23. Euromoney 42

N O T E S Notes on slide 22: Composition and calibration of TLAC Note: The Firm’s estimate of minimum total loss absorbing capacity (“TLAC”) is based on the Federal Reserve’s (“Fed”) October 30, 2015 proposed rule establishing total loss-absorbing capacity, long-term debt, and clean holding company requirements for U.S. global systemically important bank holding companies. The estimate reflects certain assumptions regarding the inclusion or exclusion of certain liabilities, including but not limited to: notes governed by law that is different from the local law of the relevant resolution entity, notes with acceleration clauses for reasons other than insolvency or payment default, holdings of other global systemically important banks’ TLAC, and structured notes as defined by the Firm. These assumptions may change as future regulatory guidance is received. In addition, while the Firm’s current estimate assumes a 2.0% Method 1 GSIB surcharge (based on 2014 market for denominators) and 3.5% Method 2 GSIB surcharge, these surcharges may change in the future, which may impact the Firm’s TLAC and eligible debt requirements under the proposed TLAC rules 1.

A S S E T M A N A G E M E N T Notes appendix Page 1 1. The “% of 10-year LT mutual fund AUM in top 2 quartiles” analysis represents the proportion of assets in mutual funds that are ranked in the top 2 quartiles of their respective peer category on a 10-year basis as of December 31, 2015. The sources of these percentile rankings, peer category definitions for each fund and the asset values used in the calculations are: Lipper (U.S. and Taiwan-domiciled funds), Morningstar (UK, Luxembourg and Hong Kong-domiciled funds), Nomura (Japan-domiciled funds), and FundDoctor (South Korea-domiciled funds). The analysis includes only Global Investment Management retail open-ended mutual funds that are ranked by the aforementioned sources. The analysis is based on percentile rankings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, at the ‘primary share class’ level for Luxembourg, UK, and Hong Kong-domiciled funds and at the aggregate fund level for all other funds. The ‘primary share class’ is defined by Morningstar and denotes the share class considered the best proxy for the fund. Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one 'primary share class' territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to ‘Offshore Territories’ and ‘HK SFC Authorized’ funds only). The analysis excludes money market funds, Undiscovered Managers Fund, and Brazil and India-domiciled funds. The asset values were redenominated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates from the aforementioned sources. The analysis pertains to percentage of assets under management, not percentage of funds. The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future performance, which may vary Page 2 1. The “mutual funds with a 4/5 star rating” analysis is sourced from Morningstar for all funds with the exception of Japan-domiciled funds; Nomura was used for Japan-domiciled funds. The analysis includes both Global Investment Management and Global Wealth Management open-ended funds that are rated by the aforementioned sources. The share class with the highest Morningstar star rating represents its respective fund. The Nomura star rating represents the aggregate fund. Other share classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings; the highest rated share class may not be available to all investors. All star ratings sourced from Morningstar reflect the Morningstar Overall RatingTM. For Japan-domiciled funds, the star rating is based on the Nomura 3-year star rating. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated by Morningstar nor Nomura and hence excluded from this analysis. Other funds which do not have a rating are also excluded from this analysis. Ratings are based on past performance and are not indicative of future results 23
