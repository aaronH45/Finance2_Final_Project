Product & Services Detail (excluding eLong) – Fourth Quarter 2015

Hotel revenue increased 24% in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a 39% increase in room nights stayed driven by the inorganic impact of acquisitions as well as the healthy growth in Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, partially offset by an 11% decrease in revenue per room night. Revenue per room night decreased primarily due to deliberate margin reductions aimed at expanding the size and availability of the global hotel supply portfolio, an unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact, as well as increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs, partially offset by a favorable book-to-stay impact. Revenue per room night is expected to continue to decrease year-over-year in 2016. Average daily room rates (“ADRs”) decreased 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to an unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 * Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. See pages 14-18 below for a description and reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure.  

Note: Some numbers may not add due to rounding.  

Adjusted Cost of Revenue  

   •   For the fourth quarter of 2015, total adjusted cost of revenue increased 27%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, due to $35 million more in customer operations expenses, $18 million more in data center and other costs, as well as $16 million more in credit card processing costs, primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes.  

   •   For the full year 2015, total adjusted cost of revenue increased 13%, compared to the prior year, due to $54 million more in customer operations expenses, $46 million more in data center and other costs, as well as $36 million more in credit card processing costs, primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes (offset by a decrease in fraud and chargeback expenses).  

   •   Acquisitions contributed approximately 19 and 9 percentage points of inorganic growth to adjusted cost of revenue growth during the fourth quarter and full year 2015, respectively.  

Adjusted Selling and Marketing  

   •   For the fourth quarter of 2015, total adjusted selling and marketing expense increased 33%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, due to a $152 million or 34% increase in direct costs, including online and offline marketing expenses.

   •   For the full year 2015, total adjusted selling and marketing expense increased 23%, compared to prior year, due to $518 million or 24% increase in direct costs, including online and offline marketing expenses.

   •   Acquisitions contributed approximately 21 and 8 percentage points of inorganic growth to adjusted selling and marketing growth during the fourth quarter and full year 2015, respectively.  

Adjusted Technology and Content  

   •   For the fourth quarter of 2015, total adjusted technology and content expense increased 48%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to $45 million more in personnel and overhead costs, net of capitalized salary costs, to support key technology projects primarily for the corporate technology function and Brand Expedia, as well as a $10 million increase in direct costs to support the growth of the technology platforms.  

   •   For the full year 2015, total adjusted technology and content expense increased 22%, compared to prior year, primarily due to $72 million more in personnel and overhead costs, net of capitalized salary costs, to support key technology projects primarily for the corporate technology function and Brand Expedia, as well as a $25 million increase in direct costs to support the growth of the technology platforms.  

   •   Acquisitions contributed approximately 27 and 10 percentage points of inorganic growth to adjusted technology and content growth during the fourth quarter and full year 2015, respectively.  

Adjusted General and Administrative  

   •   For the fourth quarter of 2015, total adjusted general and administrative expense increased 55%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a $28 million increase in consulting and legal fees related to the heightened M&A activity for the quarter, as well as a $28 million increase in personnel costs.

Depreciation Expense  

Depreciation expense increased $27 million or 39% to $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $74 million or 29% to $333 million in 2015, primarily due to increased expenses related to previously capitalized software development costs for completed technology projects which have been placed into service as well as investments in the corporate technology infrastructure. Depreciation expense is expected to continue to increase as additional projects are completed.  

Stock-Based Compensation Expense  

Stock-based compensation expense increased $28 million or 176% to $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $90 million or 131% to $159 million in 2015, primarily due to the acceleration of stock-based awards related to the acquisitions of Orbitz Worldwide and HomeAway, as well as increases in the overall and executive stock-based compensation.

Note: Some numbers may not add due to rounding.  

Page 6 of 20  

For the fourth quarter of 2015, Adjusted EBITDA (excluding eLong) increased 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Core OTA Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% in the fourth quarter of 2015, driven primarily by Hotels.com, Travelocity, EAN, Wotif Group and Brand Expedia, partially offset by Hotwire. Consolidation of the HomeAway and Orbitz Worldwide financial statements (including related deal and integration costs) reduced fourth quarter 2015 Expedia (excluding eLong) Adjusted EBITDA growth by 4 percentage points.  

For the full year 2015, Adjusted EBITDA (excluding eLong) increased 11% compared to 2014. Core OTA Adjusted EBITDA increased 15% in 2015, driven primarily by Hotels.com, Brand Expedia, EAN, Travelocity and Wotif Group, partially offset by Hotwire. Consolidation of the HomeAway and Orbitz Worldwide financial statements (including related deal and integration costs) reduced 2015 Expedia (excluding eLong) Adjusted EBITDA growth by 4 percentage points.  

In addition, the Paris terrorist attacks in November 2015 negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA by an estimated $10 million to $15 million and Adjusted EBITDA growth by approximately 4 to 5 percentage points for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 1 percentage point for the full year 2015.  

Legal reserves, occupancy tax and other  

During 2015, we received a refund of prepaid pay-to-play payments of $132 million from the State of Hawaii in connection with the general excise tax litigation. In addition, during 2015, we recorded a $24 million benefit in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other for the recovery of costs related to occupancy tax litigation matters. These gains were partially offset by charges for changes in our reserve related to hotel occupancy and other taxes. During 2014, we recognized approximately $25.5 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in the San Francisco occupancy tax proceedings.  

Restructuring and Related Reorganization Charges  

In connection with the migration of technology platforms and centralization of technology, supply and other operations, primarily related to acquisition integrations including Orbitz Worldwide and the Wotif Group, we recognized $23 million in restructuring and related reorganization charges during the three months ended December 31, 2015 and $105 million during 2015. The charges were primarily related to employee severance and benefits related to the Orbitz integration and represent estimated severance amounts under pre-existing written plans and contracts Orbitz had with its employees, as well as stock-compensation charges of $33 million for acceleration of replacement awards pursuant to certain of these agreements. We expect to incur approximately $30 million to $40 million of additional restructuring costs in 2016 related to these integrations.  

In conjunction with the migration of technology platforms and centralization of technology, supply and other operations primarily related to acquisition integration including Wotif Group, we recognized $26 million in restructuring charges during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014. These charges were primarily related to severance and related benefits as well as an Australian stamp duty tax that is payable to certain Australian jurisdictions related to business restructuring events.  

Interest and Other  

Consolidated interest income decreased $4 million or 65% in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $11 million or 39% in 2015, compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to lower invested balances and lower rates of return for the fourth quarter and lower rates of return for full year 2015. Lower investment balances in the fourth quarter of 2015 were the result of acquisition activity including Orbitz Worldwide and HomeAway. Lower rates of return were due to a shift out of higher-yielding currencies due to the sale of eLong and funding U.S. dollar denominated acquisitions, as well as lower market rates in certain currencies. Consolidated interest expense increased $8 million or 28% in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $28 million or 29% in 2015, primarily due to higher long-term debt balances.  

Consolidated other, net was a loss of $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to a gain of $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The gain in the fourth quarter of 2014 was primarily related to foreign exchange hedging. Consolidated other, net was a gain of $113 million in 2015, compared to a gain of $18 million in 2014. The gain in 2015 was primarily related to a noncontrolling interest basis adjustment related to the acquisition of a majority stake in the AirAsia joint venture, as well as impacts from foreign exchange. The gain in 2014 was primarily related to income from  

Page 7 of 20  

 joint ventures as well as foreign exchange. Foreign currency rate fluctuations negatively impacted fourth quarter and full year 2015 revenue growth rates reflecting depreciation in certain foreign currencies compared to the prior year periods. Expedia’s revenue hedging program is designed to offset the book-to-stay impact on merchant hotel revenue. Expedia includes any realized gains or losses from the revenue hedging program in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.  

Income Taxes  

The consolidated effective tax rate on GAAP pre-tax income was (117%) and 22% for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, respectively, compared with 36% and 20% in the prior year periods. The change in the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 was primarily due to certain non-deductible items in both periods, as well as reserves for uncertain tax positions recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2015, taxes are measured against a pretax loss resulting in a negative tax rate. The change in the effective tax rate for 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the effective tax rate on the gain on the sale of eLong during 2015, and the release of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in 2014. In addition to these factors, our effective tax rate for 2015 was lower than the 35% federal statutory rate due to earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside of the United States, predominately Switzerland, where our statutory income tax rate is lower, as well as the effective tax rate on the gain on the sale of eLong. The effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted net income (“ANI”) was 24% and 25% for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, respectively, compared with 33% and 25% in the prior year period. The change in the ANI rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the tax treatment of certain losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we did not record a tax benefit in 2014. The ANI effective tax rate for 2015 was essentially consistent with the prior year period.  

Balance Sheet, Cash Flows and Capitalization  

Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2015, consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion and consolidated free cash flow totaled $581 million. Both measures include $525 million from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily driven by an increase in deferred merchant bookings. For the three months ended December 31, 2015, consolidated free cash flow decreased $47 million, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased capital expenditures driven by investments in the corporate technology infrastructure, real estate projects and capitalized labor increases. For the year ended December 31, 2015, consolidated free cash flow decreased $458 million, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased capital expenditures driven by the acquisition of Expedia’s future corporate headquarters for $229 million, investments in the corporate technology infrastructure, capitalized labor increases and other real estate projects.  

Long-term debt totaled $3.2 billion at December 31, 2015 consisting of $746 million, net of discount, in 5.0% senior notes due 2026; $497 million, net of discount, in 4.5% senior notes due 2024; $707 million, net of discount, in 2.5% (€650 million) senior notes due 2022; $750 million, net of discount, in 5.95% senior notes due 2020 and $500 million in 7.456% senior notes due 2018. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, Expedia had a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which was essentially untapped. Subsequent to year-end, Expedia increased the facility to $1.5 billion and extended the term through January 2021.  

At December 31, 2015, Expedia, Inc. had stock-based awards outstanding representing approximately 18.5 million shares of Expedia common stock, consisting of options to purchase approximately 17.1 million common shares with a $71.77 weighted average exercise price and weighted average remaining life of 4.9 years, and approximately 1.4 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”).  

During 2015, Expedia, Inc. repurchased 0.5 million shares of Expedia, Inc. common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $45 million excluding transaction costs (an average of $85.27 per share). As of December 31, 2015, there were approximately 11.2 million shares remaining under the April 2012 and the February 2015 repurchase authorizations.  

On December 10, 2015, Expedia, Inc. paid a quarterly dividend of $31 million ($0.24 per common share). In addition, on February 8, 2016, the Executive Committee of Expedia’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of outstanding common stock to be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 10, 2016, with a payment date of March 30, 2016. Based on current shares outstanding, the total payment for this quarterly dividend is estimated to be approximately $36 million. Future declaration of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of Expedia’s Board of Directors.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures  

Expedia, Inc. reports Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Expenses (non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP selling and marketing, non-GAAP technology and content and non-GAAP general and administrative) and certain measures excluding eLong, Inc., all of which are supplemental measures to GAAP and are defined by the SEC as non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. Management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS have certain limitations in that they do not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS also exclude certain items related to transactional tax matters, which may ultimately be settled in cash, and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Legal Proceedings sections, as well as the notes to the financial statements, included in the Company’s annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The definition of Adjusted Net Income was revised in the fourth quarters of 2010, 2011 and 2012 and the definition for Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization was revised in the fourth quarter of 2012. The definition of Adjusted Expenses was revised in the first quarter of 2014 and in the second quarter 2015.  

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income / (loss) plus: (1) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans; (2) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements; and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree; (3) certain infrequently occurring items, including restructuring; (4) items included in Legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, which includes reserves for potential settlement of issues related to transactional taxes (e.g. hotel and excise taxes), related to court decisions and final settlements, and charges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain transactional tax proceedings; (5) gains (losses) realized on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net; and (6) depreciation.  

The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure for analysts and  

Page 14 of 20  

 investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. In addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related impacts, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. The definition for Adjusted EBITDA was revised in the fourth quarter of 2012.  

Adjusted Net Income generally captures all items on the statements of operations that occur in normal course operations and have been, or ultimately will be, settled in cash and is defined as net income/(loss) attributable to Expedia, Inc. plus net of tax: (1) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to equity plans of certain subsidiaries and equity-method investments; (2) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets, including as part of equity-method investments, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree and (iv) gains (losses) recognized on noncontrolling investment basis adjustments when we acquire controlling interests; (3) currency gains or losses on U.S. dollar denominated cash or investments held by eLong; (4) certain other infrequently occurring items, including restructuring charges; (5) items included in Legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, which includes reserves for potential settlement of issues related to transactional taxes (e.g., hotel occupancy and excise taxes), related court decisions and final settlements, and charges incurred, if any, for monies that may be required to be paid in advance of litigation in certain transactional tax proceedings, including as part of equity method investments; (6) discontinued operations; (7) the noncontrolling interest impact of the aforementioned adjustment items and (8) unrealized gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net. We believe Adjusted Net Income is useful to investors because it represents Expedia, Inc.’s combined results, taking into account depreciation, which management believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the impact of certain expenses, infrequently occurring items and items not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. The definition for adjusted net income was revised in the fourth quarters of 2010, 2011 and 2012.  

Adjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by adjusted weighted average shares outstanding, which include dilution from options per the treasury stock method and include all shares relating to RSUs in shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS. This differs from the GAAP method for including RSUs, which treats them on a treasury method basis. Shares outstanding for Adjusted EPS purposes are therefore higher than shares outstanding for GAAP EPS purposes. We believe Adjusted EPS is useful to investors because it represents, on a per share basis, Expedia’s consolidated results, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense, taxes, foreign exchange gains or losses, and minority interest, but excluding the effects of certain expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS have similar limitations as Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, Adjusted Net Income does not include all items that affect our net income / (loss) and net income / (loss) per share for the period. Therefore, we think it is important to evaluate these measures along with our consolidated statements of operations.  

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it represents the operating cash flow that our operating businesses generate, less capital expenditures but before taking into account other cash movements that are not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses, such as financing activities, foreign exchange or certain investing activities. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, it is important to evaluate Free Cash Flow along with the consolidated statements of cash flows.  

Adjusted Expenses (cost of revenue, selling and marketing, technology and content and general and administrative expenses) exclude stock-based compensation related to expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and other equity compensation under applicable stock-based compensation accounting standards as well as depreciation expense. Expedia, Inc. excludes stock-based compensation and depreciation expenses from these measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that we do not believe are necessarily reflective of our ongoing cash operating expenses and cash operating income. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting applicable stock-based compensation accounting standards,  

Page 15 of 20  

 management believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing management with an important tool for financial operational decision making and for evaluating our own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. Exclusion of depreciation expense also allows the year-over-year comparison of expenses on a basis that is consistent with the year-over-year comparison of Adjusted EBITDA. There are certain limitations in using financial measures that do not take into account stock-based compensation and depreciation expense, including the fact that stock-based compensation is a recurring expense and a valued part of employees’ compensation and depreciation expense is also a recurring expense and is a direct result of previous capital investment decisions made by management. Therefore it is important to evaluate both our GAAP and non-GAAP measures. See the Notes to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for stock-based compensation and depreciation expense by line item. In addition, in the second quarter of 2015, we included an adjustment to remove operating expenses related to eLong due to our sale on May 22, 2015.  

Expedia, Inc. (excluding eLong). Expedia sold its ownership interest in eLong, Inc. on May 22, 2015. In order to allow comparison with prior periods for the ongoing Expedia businesses, Expedia, Inc. (excluding eLong) gross bookings, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted EPS, Net income (loss) attributable to the Company, Diluted EPS and free cash flow each exclude the impact of eLong.
