Non-GAAP Financial Measures: This press release includes information about non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP tax rates, and non-GAAP free cash flow (collectively the “non-GAAP financial measures”). These non-GAAP financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating the company’s performance.

The primary purpose of using non-GAAP measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors who wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash or non-recurring items, such as certain one-time charges, on the company’s operating performance. While strategic decisions, such as those related to the issuance of equity awards (resulting in stock-based compensation), mergers and acquisitions, real estate activity or the issuance of debt securities, are made to further the company’s long-term strategic objectives and impact the company’s statement of operations under GAAP measures, these items affect multiple periods and management is not able to change or affect these items in any particular period. As such, management believes that supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure that excludes items that are not directly related to performance in any particular period provides management and investors with a more complete view of the company’s operational performance. Further, to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP measures, the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the company’s relative performance against other companies that also report non-GAAP operating results.

Non-GAAP earnings per share excludes the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, amortization of acquired leases, the net amortization of debt discount on the company’s convertible senior notes, and gains/losses on conversions of the company’s convertible senior notes, gains/losses on sales of land and building improvements, and termination of office leases, as well as income tax adjustments. These items are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these items were not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but were made for the company’s long-term benefit over multiple periods. 

The purpose of the non-GAAP tax rate is to quantify the excluded tax adjustments and the tax consequences associated with the above excluded items. The company reports a projected long-term tax rate to eliminate the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items, which can vary in size and frequency. This projected long-term non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change in the future for a variety of reasons, such as, for example, significant changes in the company’s geographic earnings mix including acquisition activity or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where the company operates. 

Specifically, management is excluding the following items from its non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4 and FY16 and its non-GAAP estimates for Q1 and FY17:

•Stock-Based Expenses: The company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. 

•Amortization of Purchased Intangibles and Acquired Leases: The company views amortization of acquisition- and building-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, and acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. 

•Amortization of Debt Discount: Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed 

interest expense on the company’s $1.15 billion of convertible senior notes due 2018 that were issued in a private placement in March 2013. The imputed interest rate was approximately 2.5% for the convertible notes due 2018, while the actual coupon interest rate of the notes is 0.25%. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. 

•Non-Cash Gains/Losses on Conversion of Debt: Upon settlement of the company’s convertible senior notes, we attribute the fair value of the consideration transferred to the liability and equity components of the convertible senior notes. The difference between the fair value of consideration attributed to the liability component and the carrying value of the liability as of settlement date is recorded as a non-cash gain or loss on the statement of operations. 

•Gain on Sales of Land and Building Improvements: The company views the non-operating gains associated with the sales of the land and building improvements at Mission Bay to be a discrete item. 

•Lease Termination Resulting From Purchase of Office Building: The company views the non-cash, one-time gain associated with the termination of its lease at 50 Fremont to be a discrete item. 

•Income Tax Effects and Adjustments: Since fiscal 2015, the company has utilized a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisitions-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, amortization of acquired leases, amortization of debt discount, gains/losses on the sales of land and building improvements, gains/losses on conversions of debt, and termination of office leases. The projected rate also assumes no new acquisitions in the three-year period, and considers other factors including the company’s tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the company operates. This long-term rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, such as significant changes in the geographic earnings mix, including acquisition activity, or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where the company operates. The company re-evaluates this long-term rate on an annual basis, and, as appropriate, if a significant event materially affects it. Its fiscal 2016 non-GAAP tax provision used a rate of 35.5 percent, which reflected the related tax impact from the recent U.S. Tax Court decision in Altera Corporation’s litigation with the Internal Revenue Service. The company’s fiscal 2017 fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate is 35.0 percent.

The company defines the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. For this purpose, capital expenditures does not include our strategic investments, nor does it include any costs or activities related to our purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, and building in progress - leased facilities.
