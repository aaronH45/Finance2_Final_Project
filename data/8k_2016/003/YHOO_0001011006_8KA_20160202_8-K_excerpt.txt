Preliminary Note:  

This Form 8-K/A amends and updates the disclosures made in the Form 8-K filed by Yahoo! Inc. (the “Company”) on February 2, 2016 (the “Original 8-K”).  

 Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities  

On February 2, 2016, the Company filed the Original 8-K disclosing that it had begun notifying employees impacted by its plans to reduce the Company’s workforce by 15 percent by the end of 2016 and to exit five offices in Dubai, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid and Milan, subject to applicable laws and consultation processes. At the time of the filing of the Original 8-K, the Company reported that it was unable to estimate the pre-tax cash and non-cash charges and total charges it expected to incur in connection with this action. The Company further subsequently announced that it will also be closing its office in Burbank, California.  

The Company now estimates that it will incur pre-tax cash charges of $40 million to $48 million for severance pay expenses and related cash expenditures. The Company estimates that it will incur pre-tax cash charges of $17 million to $21 million related to the consolidation and exit of facilities related to non-cancelable lease costs and other related costs. Non-cancelable lease costs were determined based on the present value of remaining lease payments reduced by estimated sublease income. In addition, the Company estimates that it will incur pre-tax non-cash charges of $6 million to $8 million related to stock-based compensation expense and $1 million related to impairment costs. The Company estimates that it will incur a total of $64 million to $78 million in pre-tax charges, as discussed above, in connection with the planned action.  

The Company expects to recognize most of the pre-tax charges in the first quarter of 2016. Approximately $57 million to $69 million of the total charges are expected to result in future cash expenditures.
