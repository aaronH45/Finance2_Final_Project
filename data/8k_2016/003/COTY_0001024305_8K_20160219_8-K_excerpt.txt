Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On February 19, 2016, Coty Inc. (the “Company”), The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”), Galleria Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of P&G (“SplitCo”), and Green Acquisition Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), entered into a Letter Agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) to amend certain terms of the Transaction Agreement, dated July 8, 2015 (the “Transaction Agreement”), by and among the Company, P&G, SplitCo and Merger Sub, including the exhibits thereto and the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to P&G pursuant thereto. The Company, P&G, SplitCo and Merger Sub entered into the Transaction Agreement to merge P&G’s fine fragrance, color cosmetics, and hair color businesses into Merger Sub through a tax-free Reverse Morris Trust transaction.
