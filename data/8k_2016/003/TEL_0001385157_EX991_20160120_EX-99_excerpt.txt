SCHAFFHAUSEN, Switzerland — January 20, 2016 — TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE: TEL) today reported results for the fiscal first quarter ended December 25, 2015. 

First Quarter Highlights 

· Net sales of $2.83 billion, above the midpoint of guidance; down 7 percent versus the prior year and down 2 percent organically 

· Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) were $0.84, above the high end of guidance; down 6 percent versus the prior year and flat in constant currency 

· Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations (GAAP EPS) were $0.83 

· Excluding SubCom, orders were up 3 percent sequentially and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.04 

· Free cash flow was $237 million 

· Returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends 

· Announced the sale of the Circuit Protection Devices (CPD) business for $350 million 

· Recognized as a Thomson Reuters 2015 Top 100 Global Innovator for fifth consecutive year 

“I am pleased with our first quarter performance with sales in line with guidance and EPS exceeding the high end of guidance,” said TE Connectivity Chairman and CEO Tom Lynch. “Our businesses executed very well despite the uncertain macro-economic environment and continued softness in China and industrial markets. Last year’s acquisitions in Sensors and Medical continued to gain momentum, and we advanced our strategy to focus on harsh environment applications with the announced sale of our Circuit Protection Devices business. 

“For the year, we expect continued strength in our Transportation segment to offset weakness in industrial markets and softness in China,” said Lynch. “We anticipate industrial markets to pick up in the second half of fiscal year 2016 as inventory levels stabilize and orders continue to improve. We are reiterating our guidance and expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $4.00 at the midpoint, an increase of 11 percent year over year and 15 percent on a constant currency basis.”

NON-GAAP MEASURES 

“Organic Sales Growth,” “Adjusted Operating Income,” “Adjusted Operating Margin,” “Adjusted Other Income, Net,” “Adjusted Income Tax Expense,” “Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations,” “Adjusted Earnings Per Share,” “Adjusted Earnings Per Share in Constant Currency,” and “Free Cash Flow” are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered replacements for results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of these measures is that they exclude the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using these non-GAAP measures in combination with the most directly comparable GAAP measures in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts. The following provides additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures: 

· Organic Sales Growth — is a useful measure of our underlying results and trends in the business. It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and Organic Sales Growth consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and divestitures, if any. Organic Sales Growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that: i) are not completely under management’s control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; or ii) do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. 

· Adjusted Operating Income — represents operating income (the most comparable GAAP measure) before special items including charges or income related to restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, and other income or charges, if any. We utilize Adjusted Operating Income to assess segment level core operating performance and to provide insight to management in evaluating segment operating plan execution and underlying market conditions. It also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. Adjusted Operating Income is a useful measure for investors because it provides insight into our underlying operating results, trends, and the comparability of these results between periods. 

· Adjusted Operating Margin — represents operating margin (the most comparable GAAP measure) before special items including charges or income related to restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, and other income or charges, if any. We present Adjusted Operating Margin before special items to give investors a perspective on the underlying business results. This measure should be considered in conjunction with operating margin calculated using our GAAP results in order to understand the amounts, character and impact of adjustments to operating margin. 

· Adjusted Other Income, Net — represents other income, net (the most comparable GAAP measure) before special items including tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, if any. We present Adjusted Other Income, Net as we believe that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. 

3 

· Adjusted Income Tax Expense — represents income tax expense (the most comparable GAAP measure) after adjusting for the tax effect of special items including charges related to restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, other income or charges, and certain significant special tax items, if any. We present Adjusted Income Tax Expense to provide investors further information regarding the tax effects of adjustments used in determining the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations (as defined below). 

· Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations — represents income from continuing operations attributable to TE Connectivity Ltd. (the most comparable GAAP measure) before special items including charges or income related to restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior pe riod tax returns and other tax items, certain significant special tax items, other income or charges, if any, and, if applicable, the related tax effects. We present Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations as we believe that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations provides additional information regarding our underlying operating results, trends and the comparability of these results between periods. 

· Adjusted Earnings Per Share — represents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to TE Connectivity Ltd. (the most comparable GAAP measure) before special items, including charges or income related to restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, certain significant special tax items, other income or charges, if any, and, if applicable, the related tax effects. We present Adjusted Earnings Per Share because we believe that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. We believe such a measure provides a picture of our results that is more comparable among periods since it excludes the impact of special items, which may recur, but tend to be irregular as to timing, thereby making comparisons between periods more difficult. It also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. 

· Adjusted Earnings Per Share in Constant Currency — represents Adjusted Earnings Per Share excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We believe constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our earnings per share. 

· Free Cash Flow (FCF) — is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. The difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and Free Cash Flow consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify. We believe Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations. 

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items, if any, minus net capital expenditures. Net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. These items are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. Voluntary pension contributions are excluded from the GAAP measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. Certain special items, including net payments related to pre-separation tax matters, also are considered by management in evaluating Free Cash Flow. 

Free Cash Flow subtracts certain cash items that are ultimately within management’s and the Board of Directors’ discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs  

4 

than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. It should not be inferred that the entire Free Cash Flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures, as our definition of Free Cash Flow does not consider certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt payments. In addition, we may have other discretionary expenditures, such as discretionary dividends, share repurchases, and business acquisitions, that are not considered in the calculation of Free Cash Flow.
