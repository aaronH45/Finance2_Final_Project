For Immediate Release: February 4, 2016 

Occidental Petroleum Announces 4th Quarter 2015 Results 

· 2015 year-end cash balance of $4.4 billion 

· 2016 capital program not to exceed $3.0 billion with production growth of 2 to 4 percent from ongoing operations 

HOUSTON – February 4, 2016 – Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) announced operating cash flow before working capital for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $944 million, with total cash on the balance sheet at December 31, 2015 of $4.4 billion. Core results for the fourth quarter of 2015 were a loss of $129 million or $0.17 per diluted share. Reported results were a loss of $6.78 per diluted share for the quarter, including $5.4 billion of after-tax charges, mostly due to impairments. 

In announcing the results, Chief Executive Officer Stephen I. Chazen said, “In 2015, we continued exiting our non-core assets in order to streamline the business. Our 2015 capital spending was down by 36 percent compared to a year ago, and total company production still grew by 14 percent with Permian Resources growing 47 percent. 

“We continue to focus on capital and operating efficiencies. Our Permian drilling and completion costs declined by 33 percent. Total company operating costs declined by nearly $2.00 per barrel to $11.57 and fell further in the fourth quarter. We reduced SG&A by over $225 million or 16 percent during 2015. 

“We ended the year with $4.4 billion in cash and expect to receive about $900 million more from the Ecuador settlement and $300 million in proceeds from asset sales in the coming months. While the 2016 price environment remains challenging, we will commit capital to only our highest return projects. The company’s cash flow priorities remain the same, with the most important being the safety and maintenance of our operations and funding dividends. Our 2016 capital program is expected to be no more than $3.0 billion with production growth of 2 to 4 percent from ongoing operations.”

QUARTERLY RESULTS 

Oil and Gas 

Total oil and gas after-tax results reflected a loss of $189 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to income of $17 million for the third quarter of 2015 and $317 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease in oil and gas results on a sequential and year-over-year basis was due to the continued decline in commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by higher volumes and lower operating expenses. 

The average WTI and Brent marker prices were $42.18 per barrel and $44.71 per barrel, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of about 10 percent on a sequential quarterly basis and over 40 percent on a year-over-year basis. Our average worldwide realized crude oil prices were $38.68 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 19 percent compared with the third quarter of 2015 and 46 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. Our average worldwide NGL prices were $14.02 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decline of 4 percent from the preceding quarter and 49 percent from the fourth quarter of last year. Our average domestic natural gas price was $1.75 per MCF, a decline of 22 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with the third quarter of 2015 and a decrease of 51 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. 

For the fourth quarter of 2015, total company average daily oil and gas production volumes, excluding Williston, increased by 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) to 671,000 BOE from 596,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of 2014. The sale of our Williston Basin assets closed on November 20, 2015. Williston daily production averaged 9,000 BOE and 20,000 BOE for the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, domestic average daily production increased by 11,000 BOE to 312,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of 2015 with the majority of the increase coming from oil production, which grew by 19,000 barrels to 190,000 barrels per day, with all of the increase attributable to Permian Resources. The increase in Permian Resources oil production was partially offset by lower natural gas and oil production in Piceance and South Texas. International average daily production increased to 359,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of 2015 from 295,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in international production is mainly due to the ramp up in production at Al Hosn, which produced 60,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Total company average daily oil and gas production for the fourth quarter was about flat compared to the third quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter domestic average daily production declined by 3,000 BOE compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to lower natural gas production from Piceance and South Texas, where we have curtailed all development activities due to the gas price environment. The increase in international average daily production of 2,000 BOE compared to the third quarter of 2015 reflected improved production rates at Al Hosn and in Colombia, which increased by 10,000 BOE and 13,000 BOE, respectively, partially offset by lower production in Iraq.

Total company average daily sales volumes were 721,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 653,000 BOE for the third quarter of 2015 and 615,000 BOE in the fourth quarter of 2014. The improvement was largely due to higher volumes in Iraq resulting from liftings that slipped from prior periods and higher production at Al Hosn. 

Chemical 

Chemical pre-tax core earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $116 million, compared to $174 million in the third quarter of 2015 and $160 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, the lower results reflected weaker demand across most product lines and lower polyvinyl chloride (PVC) prices unfavorably impacting margins, partially offset by higher caustic soda prices and lower energy costs. On a year-over-year basis, the lower earnings reflected lower caustic soda pricing and lower sales volume across most product lines, partially offset by lower energy costs and improved margins in PVC resulting primarily from lower ethylene costs. 

Midstream and Marketing 

Midstream pre-tax core results for the fourth quarter of 2015 were a loss $45 million, compared to income of $31 million for the third quarter of 2015 and $168 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease in earnings compared to the third quarter of 2015 and fourth quarter of 2014 reflected lower marketing margins due to narrowing WTI and LLS differentials. Current quarter loss comparisons to both periods also included lower pipeline revenues and on a sequential quarterly basis, lower seasonal margins from our power generation operations.

Summary Highlights 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS AFFECTING EARNINGS 

Occidental’s results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. These events may recur, even across successive reporting periods. Therefore, management uses a measure called “core results,” which excludes those items. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management’s performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental’s earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings are considered representative of management’s performance over the long term. Core results are not considered to be an alternative to operating income reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
