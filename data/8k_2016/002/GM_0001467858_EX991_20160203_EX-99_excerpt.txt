Record EBIT-Adjusted of $10.8 Billion for 2015

•Full-year 2015 EPS of $5.91; EPS-adjusted of $5.02, up 65 percent from 2014 

•Fourth quarter EPS of $3.92; EPS-adjusted of $1.39, up 17 percent from 2014

•Fourth quarter net income of $6.3 billion; record EBIT-adjusted of $2.8 billion 

•Returned $5.7 billion to shareholders in 2015

DETROIT - General Motors Co. (NYSE: GM) today announced record 2015 calendar-year net income attributable to common stockholders of $9.7 billion, or $5.91 per diluted share, up from $2.8 billion, or $1.65 per diluted share in 2014. Earnings per share (EPS) adjusted for special items was $5.02, up 65 percent compared to $3.05 in 2014. 

Full-year earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) adjusted rose to a record $10.8 billion, up from $6.5 billion in 2014. EBIT adjusted margin for the year also increased, to a record 7.1 percent, compared to 4.2 percent in 2014.

“It was a strong year on many fronts, capped with record sales and earnings, and a substantial return of capital to our shareholders,” said Chairman and CEO Mary Barra. “We continue to strengthen our core business, which is laying the foundation for the company to lead in the transformation of personal mobility. We believe the opportunities this will create in connectivity, autonomous, car-sharing and electrification will set the stage for driving value for our owners for years to come.”

Special items during the calendar year impacted full-year net income to common stockholders favorably, $1.5 billion, or $0.89 per share, compared to an unfavorable $(2.4) billion impact in 2014, or $(1.40) per share. Among these special items were a net gain from the reversal of certain valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and charges for litigation matters related to the ignition switch recall and a Venezuelan bolivar currency devaluation.

Total net revenue for the year was $152.4 billion, compared to $155.9 billion in 2014. The change in net revenue is due primarily to a negative net foreign currency exchange impact of $9.3 billion. Holding exchange rates constant, net revenue in 2015 was $5.8 billion higher than 2014.

Based on its strong operating performance in 2015 and consistent with the outlook provided in January, the company reaffirms its expectation that its EPS-adjusted will be between $5.25 and $5.75 in 2016.

Fourth Quarter Results

GM’s fourth quarter 2015 net income attributable to common stockholders was $6.3 billion, or $3.92 per diluted share, up from $1.1 billion, or $0.66 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2014. Earnings per share adjusted for special items during the fourth quarter was $1.39, up 17 percent compared to $1.19 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014.

EBIT-adjusted was a record $2.8 billion and EBIT-adjusted margin was 7.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to EBIT-adjusted of $2.4 billion and EBIT-adjusted margin of 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014.

“The fourth quarter closed another very strong year of operating performance,” said Chuck Stevens, executive vice president and CFO. “We plan to improve our results in 2016, driven by a significant vehicle launch cadence, 

continued emphasis on growing our adjacent businesses and an unrelenting focus on driving efficiencies into our core operations.”

Special items during the fourth quarter of 2015 impacted net income to common stockholders favorably, $4.0 billion, or $2.53 per share, compared to an unfavorable $(0.9) billion impact in 2014, or $(0.53) per share. These special items included a $3.9 billion net non-cash benefit related to the release of the company’s valuation allowances on certain GM Europe deferred tax assets.

Total net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $39.6 billion, approximately equal to the fourth quarter of 2014. Holding exchange rates constant, net revenue during the fourth quarter was $2.4 billion higher than the fourth quarter of 2014.

We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any events or financial results, and our actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors. Among other items, such factors may include: our ability to realize production efficiencies and to achieve reductions in costs; our ability to restructure our operations in various countries; our ability to maintain quality control over our vehicles and avoid material vehicle recalls and the cost and effect on our reputation of product recalls; our ability to maintain adequate financing sources, including as required to fund new and improved products and services and investments in new technology; our ability to realize successful vehicle applications of new technology; our ability to deliver new products, services and customer experiences; volatility in the price of oil; the ability of our suppliers to timely deliver parts, components and systems; the availability of wholesale and retail financing in markets in which we operate to support the sale of our vehicles; the success of our full-size pick-up trucks and SUVs; the results of our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may limited control; changes in economic conditions, commodity prices, housing prices, foreign currency exchange rates or political stability in the markets in which we operate; changes in laws, regulations and policies or other activities of governmental authorities or stricter or novel interpretations and consequent enforcement of existing requirements; significant changes in the economic, political and regulatory environment and market conditions in China; costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations including those related to our various recalls and risks, consequences and costs associated with failure to comply with the deferred prosecution agreement; increases in our pension expense or projected pension contributions; and our ability to manage risks related to security breaches and other disruptions to our vehicles, information technology networks and systems.

Supplemental Material

(Unaudited)

The accompanying tables and charts include earnings before interest and taxes adjusted for special items, presented net of noncontrolling interests (EBIT-adjusted), earnings per share (EPS)-diluted-adjusted, return on invested capital (ROIC) and Automotive adjusted free cash flow. These metrics are not prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and have not been audited or reviewed by GM's independent auditors. EBIT-adjusted, EPS-diluted-adjusted, ROIC and Automotive adjusted free cash flow are considered non-GAAP financial measures.

Management uses EBIT-adjusted to review the operating results of its automotive segments because it excludes interest income, interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments. GM Financial uses income before income taxes-adjusted because management believes interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.

Management uses EPS-diluted-adjusted to review our consolidated diluted earnings per share results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders less certain adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted on an after-tax basis as well as certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding – diluted.

Management uses ROIC to review investment and capital allocation decisions. GM defines ROIC as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for certain assets and liabilities during the same period.

Management uses Automotive adjusted free cash flow to review the liquidity of its automotive operations. GM measures Automotive adjusted free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions, primarily related to strengthening its balance sheet, such as accrued interest on prepayments of debt and voluntary contributions to employee benefit plans.

Management uses these non-GAAP measures in its financial and operational decision making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes as they provide additional transparency of GM's core operations. These measures allow management to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions.

GM's calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures.

Vehicle Sales

GM presents both wholesale and retail vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of its revenue and market share. GM does not currently export vehicles to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria. Accordingly, these countries are excluded from industry sales data in the tables below and corresponding calculations of its market share.

Wholesale Vehicle Sales

Wholesale vehicle sales data, which represents sales directly to dealers and others, is the measure that correlates GM's revenue from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. Wholesale vehicle sales exclude vehicles produced by joint ventures. In the year ended December 31, 2015, 48.3% of GM's wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes total wholesale vehicle sales of new vehicles by automotive segment (vehicles in thousands):

Retail Vehicle Sales and Market Share

Retail vehicle sales data, which represents sales to the end customers based upon the good faith estimates of management, including fleets, does not correlate directly to the revenue GM recognizes during the period. However, retail vehicle sales data is indicative of the underlying demand for GM vehicles. Market share information is based primarily on retail vehicle sales volume. In countries where end customer data is not readily available other data sources, such as wholesale or forecast volumes, are used to estimate retail vehicle sales.

Retail vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture. Certain joint venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales on non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures. Retail vehicle sales data includes vehicles sold through the dealer registration channel. This sales channel consists primarily of dealer demonstrator, loaner and self-registered vehicles (primarily in Europe). These vehicles are not eligible to be sold as new vehicles after being registered by dealers. Certain fleet sales that are accounted for as operating leases are included in retail vehicle sales at the time of delivery to the daily rental car companies. The following table summarizes total retail sales volume, or estimated sales volume where retail sales volume is not available, of new vehicles by geographic region (vehicles in thousands):
