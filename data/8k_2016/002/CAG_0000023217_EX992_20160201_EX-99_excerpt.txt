The Company’s previously filed unaudited interim financial statements for the twenty-six weeks ended November 29, 2015 reflect the Business as discontinued operations, and, accordingly, additional pro forma information relating to this period is not required to be included herein.

   •   Notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information  

1. Basis of Presentation  

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented here is based on the historical consolidated financial information of the Company, as previously provided in or derived from filings with the SEC. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2015, May 25, 2014, and May 26, 2013 assume the Transaction was consummated as of the beginning of the earliest fiscal year presented.  

2. Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet Information  

The Business has been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s previously filed unaudited interim financial statements as of for the twenty-six weeks ended November 29, 2015. The related assets and liabilities of the Business are reflected in the November 29, 2015 unaudited condensed balance sheet as assets/liabilities held for sale. In connection with the completion of the Transaction, the related amounts will be eliminated from, and the net proceeds received ($2.7 billion) will be reflected in, the Company’s balance sheet. The net proceeds are subject to working capital and other adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Transaction.  

The Company has separately announced plans to use a significant portion of the net proceeds to effect the retirement or repurchase of certain existing debt. The outcome of these actions is uncertain at this time.  

3. Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations  

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations include adjustments made to historical financial information that were determined assuming the Transaction had been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented. These adjustments reflect the elimination of the results of operations of the Business as a result of the Transaction, as well as the results of operations of certain minor private label operations that were not included in the Transaction, but which the Company expects to dispose of within the next several months. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information does not include the impact of potential cost savings, other operating efficiencies or other operating dis-synergies that could result from the Transaction. Furthermore, no allocation of the Company’s corporate interest costs have been made to the divested Business and no assumed application of the net proceeds from the Transaction have been assumed for purposes of the presentation of unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations included herein.
