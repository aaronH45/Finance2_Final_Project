In connection with Mr. Page’s and Ms. Woertz’s elections, the Board of Directors increased its size from 11 to 13 directors, and Mr. Page and Ms. Woertz joined the Board of Directors to fill the resulting vacancies. 

The Board of Directors has determined that each of Mr. Page and Ms. Woertz is an independent director under the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, including the listing standards applicable to audit and compensation committee members, and the Company’s independence guidelines, as set forth in its Corporate Governance Guidelines (available on 3M’s Web site at www.3M.com, under Investor Relations — Corporate Governance). 

Mr. Page and Ms. Woertz will participate in the compensation program for non-employee directors as described on pages 26-27 of the Company’s Proxy Statement for its Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 12, 2015 (filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 25, 2015).

The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Page is “financially literate,” and has “accounting or related financial management expertise” under the New York Stock Exchange listing standards. The Board has also determined that Mr. Page is an “audit committee financial expert” as that term is defined by applicable SEC regulations. 

The Board has appointed Ms. Woertz to the Compensation and the Finance committees of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has determined that Ms. Woertz qualifies as a “non-employee director” under SEC rules and as an “outside director” under IRS rules.
