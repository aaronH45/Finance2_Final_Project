Item 8.01. Other Events.

The attached press release discusses store and club closures by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Walmart” or the “Company”). A total of 269 stores and clubs, representing less than 1% of both global square footage and revenue, will be closed.

The financial impact of these closures is estimated to be approximately $0.20 to $0.22 of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, with approximately $0.19 to $0.20 expected to impact the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The remainder of the impact will fall into the first half of fiscal 2017. Approximately 75 percent of the impact relates to U.S. closings and the remaining portion involves Walmart International, with a large majority of the international impact relating to the closures in Brazil. Walmart will report its fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full year results on February 18, 2016. The estimated financial impact is not included in the Company’s fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full year earnings guidance. Further details regarding the store and club closures are included in the attached press release.

Walmart considers the statements above as to the estimated financial impact from the store and club closures on fourth quarter earnings for fiscal year 2016 and for the first half of fiscal 2017 to be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”), that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the Act. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors.
