Supplemental Disclosures  

The additional disclosures contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K are being filed in response to certain developments in that litigation. These additional disclosures supplement the disclosures contained in the Amended Proxy and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures contained in the Amended Proxy, which in turn should be read in its entirety. To the extent that information in this Current Report on Form 8-K differs from or updates information contained in the Amended Proxy, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall supersede or supplement the information in the Amended Proxy. Nothing in this Current Report on Form 8-K shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality of any of the disclosures set forth herein. Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Amended Proxy.  

The disclosure under the heading “Background of the Merger” is hereby supplemented by replacing the paragraph beginning at the end of page 84 (beginning “On May 12, 2015...”) and continuing on to page 85 of the Amended Proxy with the following:  

On May 12, 2015, a special meeting of the WMB Board was telephonically convened. Members of WMB management and representatives of Barclays, Gibson Dunn and Potter Anderson were also in attendance. During this meeting, the WMB Board discussed the proposed WPZ merger in which WMB would acquire all of the public outstanding common units of WPZ in an all stock-for-unit transaction at a ratio of 1.115 shares of WMB common stock per common unit of WPZ. Representatives of Gibson Dunn reviewed with the WMB Board its fiduciary duties in considering the WPZ merger and reviewed the principal legal terms of the WPZ merger agreement. In particular, the WMB Board discussed its right to change its recommendation under the WPZ merger agreement three days after providing notice of its intent to do so to the WPZ conflicts committee. Notwithstanding a change of recommendation, WMB would nevertheless remain obligated under the terms of the WPZ merger agreement to submit the WPZ merger to a vote of the WMB stockholders. The WMB Board also discussed the termination fee of $410 million payable by WMB to WPZ in certain circumstances, including any termination of the WPZ merger agreement following a failure to obtain the requisite approval of the WMB stockholders, through a waiver of a portion of WPZ GP LLC’s incentive distributions. Representatives of Barclays then presented its financial analyses regarding the consideration payable in the WPZ merger and delivered its oral opinion to the WMB Board, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated May 12, 2015, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the limitations and assumptions set forth therein, the merger consideration to be paid by WMB pursuant to the WPZ merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to WMB. Following discussion, the WMB Board unanimously determined that the transactions contemplated by the WPZ merger agreement were advisable, fair to and in the best interests of WMB and its stockholders, unanimously approved the WPZ merger agreement and unanimously recommended that WMB stockholders vote in favor of approving the WMB common stock issuance contemplated by the WPZ merger agreement and adopting a related amendment to WMB’s certificate of incorporation.  

The disclosure under the heading “Background of the Merger” is hereby supplemented by replacing the fifth full paragraph on page 95 of the Amended Proxy (beginning “On August 8, 2015...”) with the following:  

On August 8, 2015, representatives of Cravath sent a draft merger agreement to representatives of Wachtell and a draft merger agreement to representatives of Party A’s outside legal counsel. The draft merger agreement sent to representatives of Wachtell indicated that the transaction structure would need to be discussed and set forth proposals for addressing the concerns previously raised regarding the economic equivalence of ETC common shares and ETE common units. The draft merger agreement sent to representatives of Wachtell also proposed, in light of the requirement that the WPZ merger be submitted to a vote of the WMB stockholders even if the WMB Board changed its recommendation of the WPZ merger, that: (i) ETE execute the merger agreement together with a side letter agreeing not to withdraw, revoke or rescind their execution of the merger agreement at any time before the WPZ merger had been submitted to a vote of the WMB stockholders; and (ii) WMB countersign the merger agreement after termination of the WPZ merger agreement.  

The disclosure under the heading “Background of the Merger” is hereby supplemented by replacing the second full paragraph on page 96 of the Amended Proxy (beginning “Also on August 12, 2015...”) with the following:  

Also on August 12, 2015, representatives of Wachtell sent a revised draft merger agreement to representatives of Cravath. Among other things, the revised draft merger agreement identified WMB’s proposal that ETE execute the merger agreement first and that WMB countersign the merger agreement only after termination of the WPZ merger agreement as an open matter needing further discussion. In subsequent discussions between legal advisors for WMB and ETE, legal advisors for ETE advised legal advisors for WMB that ETE would execute the merger agreement only after the WPZ merger agreement had been terminated.  

The disclosure under the heading “Background of the Merger” is hereby supplemented by replacing the third full paragraph on page 107 of the Amended Proxy (beginning “Later in the day on September 25, 2015, a representative of Gibson Dunn...”) with the following:  

Later in the day on September 25, 2015, a representative of Gibson Dunn called a representative of Baker Botts to provide notification that the WMB Board was likely to change its recommendation from in favor to against the WPZ merger agreement because of its determination that the potential ETE transaction was likely more favorable to WMB’s shareholders than the WPZ merger agreement. The Gibson Dunn representative communicated that representatives of WMB and its outside advisors were available to negotiate in good faith with the WPZ conflicts committee and its advisors to the extent the WPZ conflicts committee desired to propose adjustments in the terms and conditions of the WPZ merger agreement such  

2  

 that the WMB Board could continue to recommend the WPZ merger instead of the potential ETE transaction. As required by the WPZ merger agreement, WMB then provided written notice to the WPZ conflicts committee that the WMB Board intended to change its recommendation of the WPZ merger agreement, described the key terms of the potential ETE transaction, and confirmed that representatives of WMB and its outside advisors would be available during the three-day notice period to negotiate with the WPZ conflicts committee and its advisors to the extent the WPZ conflicts committee desired to propose adjustments in the terms and conditions of the WPZ merger agreement such that the WMB Board could continue to recommend the WPZ merger instead of the potential ETE transaction.  

The disclosure under the heading “Background of the Merger” is hereby supplemented by replacing the fifth full paragraph on page 107 of the Amended Proxy (beginning “On September 26, 2015...”) with the following:  

On September 26, 2015, a meeting of the strategic review committee was telephonically convened. Members of WMB management and representatives of Barclays, Lazard, Cravath and Gibson Dunn were also in attendance. During this meeting, representatives of Cravath and Gibson Dunn discussed with the directors key open terms on the draft documentation with respect to a potential ETE transaction, including open terms concerning the governance of ETC. Representatives of Cravath and Gibson Dunn also discussed alternatives with respect to the WPZ merger agreement, including attempting to terminate the WPZ merger agreement by the mutual agreement of the parties thereto, rather than submitting the WPZ merger to a vote of the WMB stockholders after a change in the WMB Board recommendation. The strategic review committee authorized a representative of Gibson Dunn to further discuss these alternatives with representatives of Baker Botts.  

The disclosure under the heading “Background of the Merger” is hereby supplemented by adding the following disclosure after the sixth full paragraph on page 107 of the Amended Proxy (which paragraph begins “Also on September 26, 2015...”):  

Also on September 26, 2015, representatives of Barclays and representatives of Evercore held a phone call to explain the terms of the ETE transaction.  

The disclosure under the heading “Background of the Merger” is hereby supplemented by replacing the first full paragraph on page 108 of the Amended Proxy (beginning “During September 25, 26 and 27, 2015...”) with the following:  

During September 25, 26 and 27, 2015, representatives of WMB, ETE, Cravath, Gibson Dunn, Wachtell and Latham participated in various conference calls regarding the draft merger agreement and other draft transaction documents, and the parties exchanged multiple drafts of such documents. Representatives of WMB, Barclays and Gibson Dunn also participated in various conference calls with members of the WPZ conflicts committee and representatives of Evercore and Baker Botts, which resulted in the WPZ conflicts committee agreeing to terminate the WPZ merger agreement, as a result of which ETE and WMB would be in a position to execute the ETE merger agreement immediately, in exchange for an increase in the termination fee payable thereunder from $410 million to $428 million through a waiver of WPZ GP LLC’s incentive distributions in an amount not to exceed $209 million in any one fiscal quarter. As a result of WMB’s ownership of units in WPZ, the $18 million increase in the termination fee effectively had a net cost to WMB of approximately $7 million.  

The disclosure under the heading “Background of the Merger” is hereby supplemented by replacing the second full paragraph on page 108 of the Amended Proxy (beginning “Later in the day on September 27, 2015...”) with the following:  

Later in the day on September 27, 2015, a special meeting of the WPZ Board was telephonically convened. Members of WMB management and representatives of Barclays, Lazard, Cravath and Gibson Dunn were also in attendance. Representatives of Gibson Dunn provided an overview of the final terms of the termination agreement and release and the proposed increase in the termination fee payable through a waiver of incentive distributions. The chair of the WPZ conflicts committee then reported the WPZ conflicts committee’s determination after consultation with its legal and financial advisors that the  

3  

 termination of the WPZ merger agreement, the termination and release agreement and the waiver of incentive distributions were in the best interest of WPZ, its approval of the same, and its recommendation that the WPZ Board approve the termination of the WPZ merger agreement, the termination agreement and release and the waiver of incentive distribution rights. The WPZ Board was advised that Barclays and Evercore had independently analyzed potential adjustments to the financial terms of the WPZ merger and that each firm, in their independent assessments, was unable to identify adjustments to the WPZ merger that were likely to provide more value to the WMB shareholders than ETE’s offer. After discussion, upon the recommendation of the WPZ conflicts committee, the WPZ Board unanimously approved the termination of the WPZ merger agreement, the termination agreement and release and the waiver of incentive distributions.  

The disclosure under the heading “Background of the Merger” is hereby supplemented by replacing the final full paragraph on page 108 of the Amended Proxy (beginning “On September 28, 2015...”) with the following:  

On September 28, 2015, a special meeting of the WMB Board was telephonically convened. Representatives of Barclays, Lazard, Cravath and Gibson Dunn were also in attendance. Representatives of Cravath provided an overview of the final terms of the merger agreement with respect to a potential ETE transaction. Representatives of Gibson Dunn and Cravath provided an overview of the final terms of certain of the other transaction documents, including the terms of documents that would govern ETC following the closing of the transaction and documentation relating to the termination of the WPZ merger agreement. Representatives of Barclays reviewed with the WMB Board Barclays’ financial analysis of the merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement and rendered to the WMB Board an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated September 28, 2015, to the effect that, based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its written opinion, Barclays was of the opinion as of that date that, from a financial point of view, the merger consideration to be offered to WMB stockholders in the ETE transaction was fair to such WMB stockholders. In addition, representatives of Lazard reviewed with the WMB Board Lazard’s financial analysis of the merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement and rendered to the WMB Board an oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated September 28, 2015, to the effect that, based upon and subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications and limitations described to the WMB Board and set forth in its written opinion, Lazard was of the opinion that, as of that date, the merger consideration to be paid to WMB stockholders (other than certain WMB stockholders excluded from the scope of Lazard’s opinion, as described to the WMB Board and set forth in Lazard’s written opinion) in the ETE transaction was fair, from a financial point of view, to such WMB stockholders. In addition, the WMB Board was informed of the negotiations with the WPZ conflicts committee, which had led WPZ to agree to terminate the WPZ merger agreement in exchange for an increase in the termination fee.
