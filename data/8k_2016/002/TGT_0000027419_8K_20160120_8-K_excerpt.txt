As previously reported, Tina M. Tyler, former Executive Vice President and Chief Stores Officer, left Target Corporation effective January 9, 2016. In light of Ms. Tyler’s service to Target for over 11 months of fiscal year 2015, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee also determined that Ms. Tyler would remain eligible for a full fiscal 2015 short-term incentive plan payout opportunity based on Target’s actual financial performance. Eligibility for payment of the short-term incentive plan amount was conditioned upon Ms. Tyler signing the non-competition and non-solicitation agreement, and the release of claims, described previously, which Ms. Tyler signed on January 20, 2016.
