Item 8.01. Other Events.

On January 7, 2016, Ford Motor Company announced a change to our method for reporting certain components of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement employee benefit (“OPEB”) plans. Our press release dated January 7, 2016 is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein. 

Under the new method, which we adopted on December 31, 2015, we will immediately recognize pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses in income in the year incurred (generally in the fourth quarter) rather than amortizing them over many years. Historically, we recognized remeasurement gains and losses as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) and amortized them as a component of net periodic benefit cost, subject to a corridor, over the remaining service period of our active employees. The remeasurement will be recognized centrally each year instead of in Ford’s Automotive business units and will be reported as a special item since it is not reflective of the underlying operating results of Ford’s automotive business. The change to immediate recognition will have no effect on cash, pension funding requirements, or employees’ pension or OPEB benefits. 

In addition, we will now use fair value to calculate the expected return on plan assets. We previously used a market-related value of plan assets that recognized changes in fair value over time to calculate the expected return on plan assets. 

With this change, Ford’s 2015 pre-tax profit, excluding special items, is expected to increase by about $1.5 billion and is now expected to be $10 billion to $11 billion. 

We have applied this change retrospectively and have revised prior period results; Exhibit 99.2 hereto, which is incorporated by reference herein, contains revised financial information for 2013, 2014, and the first nine months of 2015.
