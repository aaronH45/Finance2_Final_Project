BROOMFIELD, Colo., Jan. 28, 2016 â€“ Ball Corporation (NYSE: BLL) today reported full-year 2015 net earnings attributable to the corporation of $280.9 million (including net after-tax expense of $209.2 million, or $1.49 per diluted share for business consolidation costs, including economic hedging losses, in addition to debt refinancing and other costs), or $1.99 per diluted share, on sales of $8.0 billion, compared to $470.0 million, or $3.30 per diluted share, on sales of $8.6 billion in 2014. Ball's full-year 2015 results were comparable net earnings of $490.1 million, or $3.48 per diluted share, compared to $552.8 million, or $3.88 per diluted share, in 2014. 

"2015 was an incredibly busy year for Ball and our people due to the proposed offer for Rexam and bringing multiple growth capital projects on line. Our global beverage can business performed very well and our aerospace business also continued its solid program execution," said John A. Hayes, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We continue to generate significant free cash flow while navigating the numerous parallel work streams to complete our proposed offer for Rexam, which we expect to close in the first half of 2016." 

Fourth quarter 2015 net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation were $55.3 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.8 billion, compared to $76.0 million, or 54 cents per diluted share, on sales of $2.0 billion, in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Details of comparable segment earnings, business consolidation activities, historical segment reporting, and Rexam transaction-related hedging and other costs for the full year and the fourth quarter can be found in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that accompany this news release. 

Metal Beverage Packaging, Americas & Asia 

Metal beverage packaging, Americas and Asia, comparable segment operating earnings for 2015 were $510.9 million on sales of $4.2 billion, compared to $534.8 million on sales of $4.2 billion in 2014. For the fourth quarter 2015, comparable segment operating earnings were $127.5 million on sales of $1.0 billion, compared to $134.0 million on sales of $1.0 billion during the same period in 2014. 

Comparable segment results for the full year were down versus 2014 largely due to continued price erosion in China. In North America and Brazil, fourth quarter volumes improved due to continued growth in specialty containers. During the fourth quarter, project start-up costs and the impact of excess industry capacity in China led to weaker year-over-year results. Early in the first quarter of 2016, the company began production on its new beverage can and end lines in Monterrey, Mexico, with a second beverage can line scheduled to start up in mid-2016. 

Metal Beverage Packaging, Europe 

Metal beverage packaging, Europe, comparable segment operating earnings in 2015 were $192.3 million on sales of $1.7 billion, compared to $222.9 million on sales of $1.9 billion in 2014. For the fourth quarter 2015, comparable segment operating earnings were $42.7 million on sales of $342.4 million, compared to $29.9 million on sales of $398.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. 

On a constant currency basis, full-year operating earnings were up despite being unfavorably affected by project start-up costs and higher year-over-year aluminum premiums. Comparable segment earnings were higher in the fourth quarter due to lower year-over-year aluminum premiums and improved plant utilization. 

Metal Food & Household Products Packaging  

Metal food and household products packaging comparable segment operating earnings for 2015 were $107.7 million on sales of $1.3 billion, compared to $154.2 million on sales of $1.5 billion in 2014. For the fourth quarter of 2015, comparable segment operating earnings were $18.2 million on sales of $284.3 million, compared to $35.1 million on sales of $345.0 million in the same period of 2014. 

Full-year 2015 results were lower due to the previously announced customer shift in North American steel food cans and manufacturing inefficiencies in the U.S., partially offset by continued strong performance in global aerosol packaging. Excluding the customer shift, volumes were relatively flat year-over-year. During the fourth quarter, the company completed investments in Europe and India to meet the continued strong global demand for metal aerosol containers. 

Aerospace and Technologies 

Aerospace and technologies comparable segment operating earnings were $81.8 million on sales of $810.1 million in 2015, compared to $93.6 million on sales of $934.8 million in 2014. For the fourth quarter 2015, comparable segment operating earnings were $20.9 million on sales of $161.7 million, compared to $23.5 

2 

million on sales of $251.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Contracted backlog at the close of the year was $617 million. 

2015 segment earnings reflected the greater number of program completions that occurred in 2014. Effective cost management continues across the segment and we were awarded multiple programs in late 2015, which will be included in future contracted backlog and further positions the company for stronger performance in the future. The company continues to pursue opportunities to further leverage its aerospace technical expertise across a broader customer portfolio. 

Outlook 

"Even after spending $528 million of capital, we achieved free cash flow of $558 million in 2015, excluding cash costs for the Rexam transaction," said Scott C. Morrison, senior vice president and chief financial officer. 

"Our 2015 and fourth quarter results were largely consistent with our expectations given anticipated currency translation and start-up cost headwinds. We continue to make progress on our proposed offer for Rexam and look forward to reaping the benefits of growth capital deployed in 2015 through improved performance, as well as the higher EVA dollar generation that these important investments will provide," Hayes said.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) During the third quarter of 2015, the company announced the closure of the Bristol, Virginia plant, a metal beverage packaging end-making facility, which will cease production in the second quarter of 2016. The closure will realign end-making capacities in North America to position the company to meet customer demand. Initial charges in the third quarter were comprised primarily of severance, pension and other employee benefits, as well as other individually insignificant items.    

 (2) During 2015, the company recorded charges related to business reorganization activities in the company's metal beverage packaging, Asia, operations.    

 (3) During 2015, the company recorded charges for the write down of property held for sale to the property's fair value less costs to sell.    

 (4) The company recorded net foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the revaluation of foreign currency denominated restricted cash held to pay a portion of the cash component of the proposed Rexam acquisition purchase price and the revaluation of the euro-denominated debt issuance in December 2015 (see note 11).

  2. Business Consolidation Activities and Other Noncomparable Items (continued)    

 (5) During 2015, the company recorded charges for professional services and other costs associated with the proposed acquisition of Rexam announced in February 2015.    

Also during 2015, the company entered into derivative financial instruments to reduce its currency exchange rate exposure associated with the British pound denominated cash portion of the announced, proposed acquisition price of Rexam and entered into derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest rate changes associated with anticipated debt issuances to fund the cash portion of the announced, proposed acquisition of Rexam. 

 (6) In connection with the December 2015 issuance of $1 billion of U.S. dollar senior notes due 2020, the company executed cross-currency swaps to convert this fixed rate U.S. dollar debt issuance to fixed rate euro debt for the life of the notes to more effectively match the future cash flows of our business. These contracts are not accounted for as hedges, and therefore, changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized in earnings.    

 (7) In February 2015, the company entered into a new $3 billion revolving credit facility to: 1) replace its existing revolving credit facility, 2) repay its Term C loan, 3) repay the outstanding balance on the existing revolving credit facility, 4) redeem the 2020 and 2021 senior notes and 5) repay the existing private placement debt of Rexam upon closing of the announced, proposed acquisition of Rexam.    

In March 2015, the company completed the redemption of both its outstanding 2020 and 2021 senior notes and recorded charges for the associated call premiums and the write-offs of unamortized financing costs and premiums. 

During the first quarter of 2015, the company recorded charges for the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the refinancing of the existing senior credit facility. 

 (8) In June 2015, Ball issued $1 billion of 5.25 percent senior notes due in June 2025. The company used the net proceeds of the offering and other available cash to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility and reduce the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility from $3 billion to $2.25 billion. As a result, the company recorded charges for the partial extinguishment related to the revolving credit facility during the second quarter of 2015.    

 (9) During 2015, the company recorded charges for the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the unsecured, committed bridge loan agreement, entered into in February 2015, in connection with the announced, proposed acquisition of Rexam.    

 (10) In December 2015, the company reduced the bridge loan agreement capacity from Â£3.3 billion to Â£1.9 billion, which resulted in the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs for the partial extinguishment of the bridge loan agreement.    

 (11) In December 2015, the company recorded interest expense for the issuance of $1 billion of 4.375 percent senior notes, â‚¬400 million of 3.5 percent senior notes, all due in December 2020, and â‚¬700 million of 4.375 percent senior notes, due in December 2023. Ball intends to use the net proceeds to fund a portion of the cash component of the purchase price in connection with the announced, proposed acquisition of Rexam.
