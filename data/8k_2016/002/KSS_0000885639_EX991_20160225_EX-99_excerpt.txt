“We believe that the strategic framework of the Greatness Agenda is working as evidenced by our achievement of five consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales increases. I am particularly encouraged by the 4% increase we saw between Thanksgiving and Christmas. At the most competitive time in retail, customers were choosing Kohl’s,” said Kevin Mansell, Kohl’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “This strength, however, was substantially offset by softness in early November and in January when demand for cold-weather goods was especially low, resulting in a quarterly comparable sales increase of 0.4%, which was below our expectations.”

Dividend

On February 24, 2016 Kohl's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.50 per share, an 11% increase over its prior dividend. The dividend is payable March 23, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 09, 2016.

Store Update

As part of the Company’s ongoing efforts to find new and innovative ways to drive sales, in 2016, Kohl’s plans to:

•Pilot a new smaller format Kohl’s store, opening 7 of these stores in various regions around the country 

•Add 2 additional Off-Aisle pilot stores in Wisconsin

•Open 12 Fila outlet stores, which will mark Kohl’s first entry into the outlet space 

Kohl’s continues to explore ways to enhance shareholder value through the optimization of its existing store portfolio. In 2016, Kohl’s will close 18 underperforming stores, representing less than one percent of total sales. The specific locations will be announced by the end of March. The closures are expected to generate annual SG&A savings of approximately $45 million and annual depreciation savings of approximately $10 million. The Company currently expects to incur approximately $150 - $170 million in charges as a result of these planned closures and the organizational realignment at the Company’s corporate offices which occurred earlier this month. The Company estimates that approximately $55 - $65 million of the charge will be recorded in the first quarter of 2016, with the remainder recorded in the second quarter. 

“We see exciting growth potential in the new stores and new formats that we are opening this year and are heavily investing in the health of our overall stores portfolio to continue to serve our current and future customers,” Mansell said. “A vital component of our omnichannel approach is to clearly understand the evolving retail environment and ensure that we are well-positioned to leverage our resources on productive projects.” 

“While the decision to close stores is a difficult one, we evaluated all of the elements that contribute to making a store successful, and we were thoughtful and strategic in our approach. We are committed to leveraging our resources on our more productive assets,” Mansell said. 

“Importantly, we also wanted to provide the best options for our associates and are proud that every affected store associate will be offered a position at a nearby Kohl’s location, or if they prefer, a competitive severance package.”
