Forward‐Looking Statements This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws regarding Marathon Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”), MPLX LP (“MPLX”), and MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P. ("MarkWest").These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, expectations, estimates and projections concerning the business and operations of MPC, MPLX, and MarkWest. You can identify forward- looking statements by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “design,” “estimate,” "objective," “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” "guidance," “imply,” “intend,” “objective,” “opportunity,” “outlook,” "plan,“ “position,” “pursue,” “prospective,” “predict,” “project,” "potential," “seek,” “target,” “could,” “may,” “should,” “would,” “will” or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the companies’ control and are difficult to predict. Factors that could cause MPC’s actual results to differ materially from those implied in the forward-looking statements include: risks described below relating to MPLX, MarkWest and the MPLX/MarkWest merger transaction; changes to the expected construction costs and timing of pipeline projects; continued/further volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry conditions; the availability and pricing of crude oil and other feedstocks; slower growth in domestic and Canadian crude supply; the effects of the lifting of the U.S. crude oil export ban; completion of pipeline capacity to areas outside the U.S. Midwest; consumer demand for refined products; transportation logistics; the reliability of processing units and other equipment; MPC’s ability to successfully implement growth opportunities; modifications to MPLX earnings and distribution growth objectives; federal and state environmental, economic, health and safety, energy and other policies and regulations, including the cost of compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard; MPC’s ability to successfully integrate the acquired Hess retail operations and achieve the strategic and other expected objectives relating to the acquisition; changes to MPC’s capital budget; other risk factors inherent to MPC’s industry; and the factors set forth under the heading "Risk Factors" in MPC's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2014, filed with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Factors that could cause MPLX's actual results to differ materially from those implied in the forward-looking statements include: negative capital market conditions, including a persistence or increase of the current yield on common units, which is higher than historical yields, adversely affecting MPLX’s ability to meet its distribution growth guidance; risk that the synergies from the MPLX/MarkWest merger transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; disruption from the MPLX/MarkWest merger transaction making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers; risks relating to any unforeseen liabilities of MarkWest; the adequacy of MPLX's respective capital resources and liquidity, including, but not limited to, availability of sufficient cash flow to pay MPLX’s distributions, and the ability to successfully execute their business plans and growth strategies; the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices and demand for crude oil, refined products, feedstocks or other hydrocarbon-based products; volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry conditions; completion of midstream infrastructure by competitors; disruptions due to equipment interruption or failure, including electrical shortages and power grid failures; the suspension, reduction or termination of MPC's obligations under MPLX's commercial agreements; modifications to earnings and distribution growth objectives; the level of support from MPC, including dropdowns, alternative financing arrangements, taking equity units, and other methods of sponsor support, as a result of the capital allocation needs of the enterprise as a whole and its ability to provide support on commercially reasonable terms; federal and state environmental, economic, health and safety, energy and other policies and regulations; changes to MPLX's capital budget; other risk factors inherent to MPLX or MarkWest's industry; and the factors set forth under the heading "Risk Factors" in MPLX's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2014, filed with the SEC; and the factors set forth under the heading "Risk Factors" in MarkWest's Annual Report on Form 10- K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2014, and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2015, filed with the SEC (former ticker symbol: MWE). These risks, as well as other risks associated with MPLX, MarkWest and the merger transaction, are also more fully discussed in the joint proxy statement and prospectus included in the registration statement on Form S-4 filed by MPLX and declared effective by the SEC on Oct. 29, 2015, as supplemented. In addition, the forward-looking statements included herein could be affected by general domestic and international economic and political conditions. Unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed here, in MPC's Form 10-K, in MPLX's Form 10-K, or in MarkWest's Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements. Copies of MPC's Form 10-K are available on the SEC website, MPC's website at http://ir.marathonpetroleum.com or by contacting MPC's Investor Relations office. Copies of MPLX's Form 10-K are available on the SEC website, MPLX's website at http://ir.mplx.com or by contacting MPLX's Investor Relations office. Copies of MarkWest's Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs are available on the SEC website (former ticker symbol: MWE), MarkWest's website at http://investor.markwest.com or by contacting MPLX’s Investor Relations office. Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure provided in this presentation. EBITDA reconciliations to the nearest GAAP financial measures are included in the Appendix to this presentation. EBITDA is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income attributable to MPC, net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The EBITDA forecast related to MPC’s marine assets was determined on an EBITDA-only basis. Accordingly, information related to the elements of net income, including tax, and interest, are not available and, therefore, a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest GAAP financial measure has not been provided. 2

Supporting MPLX’s Distribution Growth  Targeting a 12-15% growth rate in 2016, double digit distribution growth for 2017  Sale of marine business to MPLX in 2Q 2016 (~$120 MM of annual EBITDA) – Supportive valuation of not greater than 6x EBITDA and will be accretive to MPLX – Securities issued to MPC in exchange for assets – Fee-for-capacity contracts with MPC  Potential for private placement of up to $1 B of securities from MPC – Direct funding or a combination of sponsor support tools eliminates need to access public markets in 2016 15  

MPLX Enhances MPC’s Value  MarkWest Energy merger – Adds scale and diversity to MPC – Adds high quality natural gas and NGL assets in prolific shale regions – Significant commercial synergies and opportunities across value chain  Near term support provides long term value uplift – Cash distributions to MPC via LP units, IDR’s and drop-down proceeds – Substantial inherent value 16  

Driving Top Tier Financial Performance Through Sustainable Competitive Advantages 17  Fully integrated system provides optionality and flexibility  Strategically located assets  Value of MPLX  Consistent and reliable operator  Sustained performance through all cycles  Disciplined, balanced approach to capital allocation and capital return  Top tier retail system As of Dec. 31, 2015 See appendix for legend

It is basically the ratio of the process investment downstream of the crude unit to the investment of the crude unit itself. This index has many limitations as an indicator of value and is not necessarily a useful tool in predicting profitability. There is no consideration for operating, maintenance or energy efficiencies and no consideration of non-process assets such as tanks, docks, etc. Likewise it does not consider the ability to take advantage of market related feedstock opportunities.
