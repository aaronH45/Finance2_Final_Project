© PPL Corporation 2015 Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures "Earnings from ongoing operations," should not be considered as an alternative to reported earnings, or net income, which is an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). PPL believes that "earnings from ongoing operations," although a non-GAAP financial measure, is also useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's earnings excluding the Supply segment, as the spinoff was completed June 1, 2015. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance. "Earnings from ongoing operations" is adjusted for the impact of special items as described below, which includes the Supply segment's earnings now reflected in discontinued operations. Also included in special items is the loss on spinoff resulting from the fair value of the Supply segment being less than PPL's recorded value as of June 1, 2015, the date of the spinoff. "Earnings from ongoing operations (adjusted)" for 2014 also reflects, within the Corporate and Other category, the impact of spinoff dissynergies that would remain with PPL after the completion of the transaction, if left unmitigated. "Earnings from ongoing operations" is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items include: • Unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency-related economic hedges. • Supply segment discontinued operations. • Loss on the spinoff of the Supply segment. • Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business. • Impairment charges. • Workforce reduction and other restructuring effects. • Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments. • Other charges or credits that are, in management's view, not reflective of the company's ongoing operations. 39
