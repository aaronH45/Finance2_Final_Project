AIG COMMENCES CASH TENDER OFFER FOR DEBT SECURITIES  

NEW YORK, February 23, 2016 – American International Group, Inc. (NYSE: AIG) today commenced a cash tender offer for 11 series of debt securities of AIG and its subsidiaries. The complete terms of the tender offer are set forth in the offer to purchase and the related letter of transmittal, each dated today. Securities that are accepted in the tender offer will be purchased by AIG and retired and cancelled by the relevant issuer. Consummation of the tender offer is subject to a number of conditions, including the absence of any adverse legal and market developments and a financing condition (as described in the offer to purchase). Subject to applicable law, AIG may waive certain of these conditions or extend, terminate or otherwise amend the tender offer.  

AIG is offering to purchase the notes and debentures listed in Table I below in an aggregate principal amount (U.S. Dollar equivalent) of up to $1.0 billion. The early participation date for the tender offer is 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 7, 2016 (the “Early Participation Date”), and the expiration date for the tender offer is 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 21, 2016 (in each case, subject to extension). As indicated in Table I, the price to be paid for each series of notes and debentures will be based on fixed spreads to certain reference benchmarks, as further described below. The prices to be paid for the notes and debentures denominated in U.S. Dollars and Sterling will be calculated on the basis of the yield to the applicable call or maturity date of the applicable reference security listed in Table I, at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, for the notes and debentures denominated in U.S. Dollars, or 3:00 p.m., London time, for the debentures denominated in Sterling, each on the business day following the Early Participation Date, plus the fixed spread applicable to such notes or debentures as set forth in Table I. The price to be paid for the debentures denominated in Euros will be calculated on the basis of the rates payable on a reference swap, at 3:00 p.m., London time, on the business day following the Early Participation Date, plus the fixed spread applicable to such debentures, as described more fully in the offer to purchase. Holders whose notes and debentures are accepted in the tender offer will also receive a cash payment representing accrued interest from the most recent interest payment date to, but excluding, the date AIG purchases the notes and debentures. The payment date for the offer will be promptly following its expiration and is expected to be on or about March 23, 2016.  

The following is a brief summary of certain key elements of the tender offer:  

 •   Holders who validly tender and who do not validly withdraw their notes or debentures at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time on March 7, 2016 (subject to extension), the Early Participation Date, and whose securities are accepted for purchase, will receive the Total Consideration, together with accrued interest.  

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  

 •   Holders who validly tender their notes or debentures after 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the Early Participation Date but at or prior to the expiration date, and whose securities are accepted for purchase, will only be eligible to receive the Tender Offer Consideration, which is equal to the Total Consideration less the Early Participation Amount (as defined in the offer to purchase), together with accrued interest.  

 •   Tenders of notes or debentures may be validly withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 7, 2016 (subject to extension), but not thereafter.  

 •   AIG reserves the right, but is under no obligation, to increase the maximum principal amount of notes and debentures sought in the tender offer. In the event of any such increase, AIG will not be obligated (except as required by applicable law) to extend the Early Participation Date, the withdrawal date or the expiration date.  

 •   If the tender offer is oversubscribed, AIG will accept for payment all securities validly tendered in accordance with the acceptance priority levels set forth in Table I. If there are sufficient remaining funds to purchase some, but not all, of the remaining tendered notes or debentures at any acceptance priority level, AIG will accept for payment such tendered notes or debentures on a prorated basis.  

 •   The tender offer is subject to conditions, including a financing condition that provides that the tender offer is conditioned on AIG having issued and sold, in one or more capital markets financing transactions, on terms satisfactory in AIG’s reasonable judgment, debt securities providing net proceeds at least equal to a material portion, in AIG’s reasonable judgment, of the aggregate principal amount of the notes and debentures accepted in this tender offer.
