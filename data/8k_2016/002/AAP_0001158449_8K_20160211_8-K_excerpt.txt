INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT 

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition. 

On February 11, 2016, Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release setting forth its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 year ended January 2, 2016. This release includes forward looking statements including, but are not limited to, statements related to the Company's 2016 fiscal year. 

The Company's financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015 include General Parts International, Inc. ("GPI") integration costs, store closure and consolidation costs, support center restructuring expenses and amortization of GPI acquired intangible assets. In addition, the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 3, 2015 included an additional week of operations (53rd week). As a result of these expenses and the additional week, the Company’s financial results for these periods are not comparable with prior periods. Thus, the Company’s financial results have been presented in this press release on both a generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") basis and on a comparable basis to exclude the impact of the 53rd week and the integration costs, store closure and consolidation costs, restructuring expenses and amortization recognized in the respective periods. The Company has provided the required reconciliation of the financial results reported on a comparable basis to the most directly comparable GAAP basis and has provided an explanation as to why the financial results presented on a non-GAAP basis are useful to investors.

The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
