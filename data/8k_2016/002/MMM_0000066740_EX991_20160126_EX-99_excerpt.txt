“The fourth quarter capped off a year of disciplined execution from our global team with solid margin and cash flow performance,” said Inge G. Thulin, 3M’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “Throughout 2015 we controlled the controllable, while investing in the business and also returning significant cash to shareholders. 

“2015 was an important year as we prepared and positioned our company for long-term success,” Thulin continued. “We strengthened and focused our portfolio, made significant investments in the business to support growth, and made good progress in moving toward a more efficient business model through business transformation and our corporate restructuring. We are building an even stronger and more competitive company for 2016 and beyond.”

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a) In 2015, 3M updated its methodology related to how it classifies marketable securities between current and non-current. 3M also adopted two new accounting pronouncements that impacted the classification of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities between current and non-current, along with how 3M accounts for issuance costs related to long-term debt. All periods presented have been updated to reflect these changes. 

(b) In August 2015, 3M completed the acquisitions of Capital Safety and Polypore’s Separations Media business. In March 2015, 3M completed the acquisition of Ivera Medical Corp. The combination of these acquisitions increased goodwill and intangible assets — net by approximately $4.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2015. 

(c) In December 2014, 3M’s board of directors declared a first-quarter 2015 dividend of $1.025 per share (paid in March 2015). This reduced 3M’s stockholders equity and increased other current liabilities as of Dec. 31, 2014, by approximately $0.6 billion.

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

NON-GAAP MEASURES 

(Dollars in millions) 

(Unaudited) 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(e) Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are useful measures of performance and uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(f) The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M considers net debt and its components to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy. Net debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(g) The Company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. 3M’s net working capital index is defined as quarterly net sales multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable. This measure is not recognized under U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(h) The Company uses non-GAAP measures to focus on shareholder value creation. 3M uses Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), defined as annualized after-tax operating income (including interest income) divided by average operating capital. Operating capital is defined as net assets (total assets less total liabilities) excluding debt. This measure is not recognized under U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
