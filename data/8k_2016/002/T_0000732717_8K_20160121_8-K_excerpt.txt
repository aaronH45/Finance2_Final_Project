Item 8.01 Other Events. 

On January 22, 2016, AT&T Inc. ("AT&T", "we" or "the Company") provided updated information regarding certain fourth-quarter items. 

For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we expect to record a noncash, pre-tax gain of approximately $2.2 billion related to the annual remeasurement of pension and postemployment benefit plans. The gain was generated from an increase in our assumed discount rates used to measure our pension obligation to 4.6% and to 4.5% for our postretirement obligation; updates to other assumptions, including mortality; and demographic changes. The gain was partially offset by adjustments related to asset returns that were less than our assumed rate of return. Actuarial gains and losses are managed on a total company basis and are, accordingly, reflected only in consolidated results. Therefore, this gain will not affect segment operating results or margins. 

CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Information set forth in this filing contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update or revise statements contained in this filing based on new information or otherwise. 

Signature
