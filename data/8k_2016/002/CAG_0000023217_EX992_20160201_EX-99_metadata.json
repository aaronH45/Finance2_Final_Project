        "The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations include adjustments made to historical financial information that were determined assuming the Transaction had been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented. These adjustments reflect the elimination of the results of operations of the Business as a result of the Transaction, as well as the results of operations of certain minor private label operations that were not included in the Transaction, but which the Company expects to dispose of within the next several months. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information does not include the impact of potential cost savings, other operating efficiencies or other operating dis-synergies that could result from the Transaction. Furthermore, no allocation of the Companyâ€™s corporate interest costs have been made to the divested Business and no assumed application of the net proceeds from the Transaction have been assumed for purposes of the presentation of unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations included herein."
