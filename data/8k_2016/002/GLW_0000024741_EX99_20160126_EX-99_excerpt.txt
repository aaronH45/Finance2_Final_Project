FOR RELEASE –– JANUARY 26, 2016 

Corning Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2015 Financial Results and Progress on New Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework 

CORNING, N.Y. — Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW) today announced its results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2015. Highlights of the report include: 

  ·    Business segment performance consistent with the company’s expectations;    

  ·    Moderate LCD glass price declines;    

  ·    Significant progress on the company’s new strategy and capital allocation framework; and    

  ·    Substantial progress on extending Japanese yen hedges.    

Fourth-Quarter 2015 Results 

For the fourth quarter of 2015, Corning reported core sales* of $2.4 billion and core earnings per share of $0.34, compared with $2.5 billion and $0.42, respectively, in 2014. Net sales (GAAP) for the fourth quarter were $2.2 billion and GAAP earnings per share were $0.17, compared with $2.4 billion and $0.70, respectively, in 2014. 

Full-Year 2015 Results 

For the full-year 2015, core sales were $9.8 billion and core earnings per share were $1.40, compared with $10 billion and $1.42, respectively, in 2014. Net sales (GAAP) for 2015 were $9.1 billion and GAAP earnings per share were $1.00, compared with $9.7 billion and $1.73, respectively, in 2014. Adjusted operating cash flow for the full year remained strong at $3.2 billion. 

“Our fourth-quarter performance was in line with our expectations,” Wendell P. Weeks, chairman, chief executive officer and president, said. “Our long-term supply contracts and effective pricing strategies in our Corning Glass Technologies businesses continue to be particularly beneficial, and technology trends in optical communications continue to drive growth.” 

“We were especially pleased to mark several major successes right out of the gate on our new strategy and capital allocation framework which outlines our priorities for the next four years: to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength,” Weeks noted. 

Significant Progress on the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework 

In October 2015, Corning announced a new strategy and capital allocation framework that targets generating and deploying more than $20 billion through 2019, with the majority of these funds expected to come from operating cash flow. The company plans to invest approximately $10 billion in opportunities to grow and sustain its leadership positions, and return more than $10 billion to shareholders. 

*Core performance measures are non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided in the tables following this news release, as well as on the company’s website. Core performance metrics (non-GAAP) are adjusted to exclude the impact of changes in Japanese yen and Korean won foreign exchange rates, as well as other items that do not reflect ongoing operations of the company. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of attached Form 8-K for details on core performance measures.

Corning Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2015 Financial Results and Progress on New Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework 

Page Two 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, Corning marked early progress against the new strategy and capital allocation framework. The company: 

  ·    Generated significant cash flow in the quarter, resulting in $3.2 billion in adjusted operating cash flow for the year, despite continuing global economic weakness.    

  ·    Attained a moderate LCD glass price decline in the quarter, achieving the lowest sequential decline of the year. For 2015, the aggregate LCD glass price decline was the lowest in five years.    

  ·    Initiated a $1.25 billion accelerated share repurchase program (completed in January 2016), supporting the company’s commitment to return more than $10 billion to shareholders.    

  ·    Announced a realignment of the company’s interest in Dow Corning, a transaction that is expected to be accretive to the company’s earnings per share and essentially tax-free. As a result of the realignment, a newly formed entity, which will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, will hold approximately 40% ownership in Hemlock Semiconductor Group and $4.8 billion in cash. The transaction unlocks the value of Corning’s interest in Dow Corning’s silicones business, which today falls outside Corning’s three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms.    

  ·    Established a long-term supply agreement with a low-cash investment in a Gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facility adjacent to BOE Technology Group, Ltd., the largest panel manufacturer in China. The existing long-term supply agreement for Gen 8.5 and smaller panels was extended through 2025.    

  ·    Announced that Ford’s GT supercar is using Corning® Gorilla® Glass for Automotive in its windshield and in two other windows – an example of Corning leveraging its market access with leading automakers to pursue disruptive opportunities while utilizing existing assets.    

Fourth-Quarter Segment Results 

  ·    Display Technologies: Core sales in the fourth quarter were $903 million, compared with $1,055 million in the same period a year ago. Sequential LCD glass volume declined slightly, as expected. LCD glass prices continued to moderate as expected and declined less than in the third quarter. Core earnings in the fourth quarter were $234 million, compared with $356 million in the same period last year.    

  ·    Optical Communications: Sales in the fourth quarter were $736 million, compared with $676 million in a year ago. Core earnings were $47 million, compared with $48 million in the fourth quarter 2014.    

  ·    Environmental Technologies: Sales in the fourth quarter were $254 million compared with $250 million last year. Core earnings were $29 million, compared with $36 million in the comparable period a year ago.    

  ·    Specialty Materials: Sales in the fourth quarter were $275 million, compared with $319 million a year ago. Core earnings for the quarter were $44 million, compared with $30 million in the fourth quarter 2014.

  ·    Life Sciences: Sales in the fourth quarter were $202 million, compared with $215 million in the previous year’s quarter. Core earnings were $12 million, compared with $18 million in the comparable 2014 period.    

  ·    Core equity earnings from Dow Corning Corporation were $78 million, compared with $111 million in the fourth quarter 2014.    

Looking Forward 

“We expect the first quarter to be the weakest of 2016, and we anticipate growth will recover in subsequent quarters,” R. Tony Tripeny, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said. “We are encouraged with the moderation of LCD glass price declines, and we expect this trend will continue into 2016. We are sustaining market leadership in all of our businesses.” 

Corning provided the following expectations for its business segments in the first quarter of 2016: 

  ·    Display Technologies: In the first quarter, Corning anticipates that panel maker utilization will continue to decline, which will reduce inventory levels in the supply chain. As a result, the overall glass market and Corning’s LCD glass volume are expected to decline by a mid-to-high single-digit percentage sequentially. Corning’s LCD glass price decline is expected to be moderate, achieving what will be one of the lowest first-quarter declines in five years.    

For the full year, Corning expects moderate sequential price declines to continue, and its glass volume to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage year over year, in line with total glass demand growth. Corning expects global television unit sales will grow by a low single-digit percentage, and the average screen size will increase by at least 1.5 inches. The company expects panel maker utilization to increase as the year progresses, and retail LCD glass area demand to be up by a high single-digit percentage in 2016. 

During January, Corning took advantage of the stronger yen to extend its hedges. Corning is now hedged for approximately 70 percent of its projected yen exposure for the period 2016 through 2022 at a blended rate significantly below the recent spot prices. Corning will provide more details during today’s conference call. 

  ·    Optical Communications: Corning expects first-quarter sales to increase in the low-to-mid-single digit percentage range over its sales in the comparable period a year ago. For the full year, the company expects sales to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage and exceed the goal of two times the growth rate of industry capital expenditures.    

  ·    Specialty Materials: First-quarter sales are expected to decline year over year by a mid-teen percentage. For 2016, the company estimates annual sales will grow by a low-teen percentage. The variable timing of mobile device product launches drives Corning® Gorilla® Glass demand and is expected to cause significant swings in quarterly results.    

  ·    Environmental Technologies: The North American heavy-duty truck market is down after several years of robust growth. As a result, first-quarter sales are expected to decline by approximately 10%, compared with the same period last year. The full-year outlook is for sales to be down by a low single-digit percentage.

  ·    Life Sciences: First-quarter sales are expected to increase by a low single-digit percentage, compared with last year. For the full year, sales are anticipated to grow faster than the market, which is expected to be up by a low single-digit percentage.    

  ·    Core equity earnings from Dow Corning are expected to be approximately $45 million.    

“Our very strong balance sheet and competitive positions serve as the basis for executing on our new strategy and capital allocation framework. We are off to a strong start in delivering on this framework and are confident in our ability to deliver significant returns for shareholders,” Tripeny concluded.

Presentation of Information in this News Release 

Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. Corning’s non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the company’s operations. The company believes presenting non-GAAP financial measures assists in analyzing financial performance without the impact of items that may obscure trends in the company’s underlying performance. Detailed reconciliations outlining the differences between these non-GAAP measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found on the company’s website by going to www.corning.com/investor_relations and clicking “Financial Reports” on the left.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES 

In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we supplement certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements with measures adjusted to exclude certain items, to arrive at core performance measures. We believe reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions. Corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for the Japanese yen and Korean won, and uses an internally derived management rate which is closely aligned to our foreign currency hedges. In the first quarter of 2015, we changed the yen-to-dollar management rate from ¥93 to ¥99 to closely align with the yen-denominated hedges entered into for the years 2015 through 2017. Prior periods presented have been recast based on the new rate. 

Net sales, equity in earnings of affiliated companies, and net income are adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in the Japanese yen and the Korean won, gains and losses on our foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings, acquisition-related costs, discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates. Management’s discussion and analysis on our reportable segments has also been adjusted for these items, as appropriate. These measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures and a further discussion of the measures, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” below. 

Items which we exclude from GAAP measures to arrive at Core performance measures are as follows: 

  (1)   Constant-currency adjustments:  

    Constant-yen: Because a significant portion of Display Technologies segment revenues and manufacturing costs are denominated in Japanese yen, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings of translating yen into dollars. Presenting results on a constant-yen basis mitigates the translation impact of the Japanese yen, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts. As of January 1, 2015, we used an internally derived management rate of ¥99, which is closely aligned to our current yen portfolio of foreign currency hedges, and have recast all periods presented based on this rate in order to effectively remove the impact of changes in the Japanese yen.  

    Constant-won: Following the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials and because a significant portion of Corning Precision Materials’ costs are denominated in Korean won, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings from translating won into dollars. Presenting results on a constant-won basis mitigates the translation impact of the Korean won, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts without the variability caused by the fluctuations caused by changes in the rate of this currency. We use an internally derived management rate of 1,100, which is consistent with historical prior period averages of the won.  

  (2)   Foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings: We have excluded the impact of the gains and losses of our foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings for each period presented.  

  (3)   Acquisition-related costs: These expenses include intangible amortization, inventory valuation adjustments and external acquisition-related deal costs.  

  (4)   Discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments: This represents the removal of discrete adjustments attributable to changes in tax law and changes in judgment about the realizability of certain deferred tax assets, as well as other non-operational tax-related adjustments, including the tax effect of transfer pricing out-of-period adjustments in 2014 and 2015.  

  (5)   Litigation, regulatory and other legal matters: Includes amounts related to the Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) asbestos litigation, adjustments to our estimated liability for environmental-related items and other legal matters.  

  (6)   Restructuring, impairment and other charges: This amount includes restructuring, impairment and other charges, including goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and disposal costs not classified as restructuring expense.  

  (7)   Liquidation of subsidiary: The partial impact of non-restructuring related items due to the decision to liquidate a consolidated subsidiary that is not significant.    

© 2016 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved. 

  (8)   Equity in earnings of affiliated companies: These adjustments relate to items which do not reflect expected on-going operating results of our affiliated companies, such as restructuring, impairment and other charges and settlements under “take-or-pay” contracts.  

  (9)   Impacts from the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials: Pre-acquisition gains and losses on previously held equity investment and other gains and losses related to the acquisition, including post-combination expenses, fair value adjustments to the indemnity asset related to contingent consideration and the impact of the withholding tax on a dividend from Samsung Corning Precision Materials.  

  (10)   Post-combination expenses: Post-combination expenses incurred as a result of an acquisition in the first quarter of 2015.  

  (11)   Pension mark-to-market adjustment: Defined benefit pension mark-to-market gains and losses, which arise from changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets and discount rates.
