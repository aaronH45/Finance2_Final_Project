ATLANTA, Georgia - February 4, 2016 -- Teradata Corp. (NYSE: TDC) reported revenue of $719 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, versus $761 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Fourth quarter revenue decreased 6 percent when compared to the prior year period, a decrease of 1 percent when compared in constant currency.(1) For the full-year 2015, revenue was $2.530 billion, a 7 percent decrease from $2.732 billion in 2014. In constant currency, full-year revenue decreased 2 percent versus 2014. (1) Currency created a 5 percentage point headwind for both the fourth quarter and full-year revenue comparisons to prior year results.

Gross margin was 50.8 percent, versus 55.8 percent reported in the fourth quarter of 2014 under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and special items described in footnote #2, gross margin was 52.2 percent, versus 56.9 percent in the prior year period.(2) The decrease in non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter resulted primarily from deal mix and currency impact. Gross margin reported under GAAP for the full-year 2015 was 50.4 percent, versus 54.1 percent in 2014. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding special items described in footnote #2, 2015 full-year non-GAAP gross margin was 52.0 percent, versus 55.5 percent for the full-year 2014.(2) The decrease in non-GAAP gross margin for the full-year primarily resulted from deal mix and currency impact. 

Teradata reported fourth quarter GAAP net income of $41 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, which compared to net income of $118 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2014. Stock-based compensation expense and other special items (including a goodwill impairment charge of $34 million , or $0.25 of earnings per share) reduced Teradata’s 2015 fourth quarter net income by $53 million, or $0.39 of earnings per diluted share, as reported under GAAP.(2) Excluding stock-based compensation expense and special items (including goodwill impairment), non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $94 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, versus $140 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2014.(2)

Full-year net loss reported under GAAP was $(124) million, or $(0.89) per share, which compared to net income of $367 million, or $2.33 per diluted share in 2014. Stock-based compensation expense and other special items (including goodwill impairment of $374 million, or $2.62 of earnings per share) reduced Teradata’s 2015 GAAP net income by $416 million, or $2.95 of earnings per share.(2) Excluding stock-based compensation expense and special items (including goodwill impairment), full-year non-GAAP net income was $292 million, or $2.06 per diluted share in 2015, compared to $452 million, or $2.86 per diluted share in 2014.(2)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Income

Fourth quarter GAAP operating income of $63 million compared to $158 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $134 million versus $187 million in the fourth quarter of

2014.(2) The decrease in non-GAAP operating income was primarily due to lower revenue, lower product gross margin, and currency impact.

2

Full-year GAAP operating loss was $(92) million in 2015, versus operating income of $503 million in 2014. On a non-GAAP basis, full-year operating income was $409 million, versus $621 million in 2014.(2) The year-over-year decrease in non-GAAP operating income was due to lower revenue, lower gross margin, higher research and development expenses and currency impact. 

Income Taxes

Teradata’s GAAP tax rate was 39.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus 24.8% in 2014, and the fourth quarter 2015 non-GAAP tax rate was 28.8% as compared to 25.1% in 2014.(2) The year-over-year increase for both was driven by incremental tax expense resulting from the actual foreign pre-tax earnings being lower than previously forecasted in 2015. In addition, the GAAP effective tax rate was higher as a result of the $34 million impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was treated as a permanent non-deductible tax item.

The full-year 2015 GAAP tax rate was (202.4%) versus 25.7% for 2014. The 2015 GAAP tax rate was driven by $374 million of goodwill impairment charges in 2015, of which $351 million was treated as a permanent non-deductible tax item; this results in full-year GAAP income tax expense of $83 million, on a pre-tax GAAP loss of $(41) million, causing a negative tax rate of (202.4%). The full-year 2015 non-GAAP tax rate was 27.5% as compared to 27.2% for 2014.(2) There were no material discrete tax items impacting the non-GAAP tax rates for full-year 2015 or 2014. The increase between periods was driven by a lower proportion of foreign pre-tax earnings in 2015 versus 2014.

Cash Flow

For the full-year 2015, Teradata generated $401 million of cash from operating activities, compared to $680 million in 2014. Teradata generated $281 million of free cash flow(3) in 2015, versus $551 million in 2014. In addition to lower net income, the timing of accounts receivable collections between the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 had a meaningful impact on lower free cash flow in 2015 versus 2014.

Balance Sheet

Teradata ended the quarter with $839 million in cash, with over 95% held outside the United States.

As of December 31, 2015, Teradata had total debt of approximately $780 million, including $600 million outstanding under a term loan and $180 million drawn on its $400 million revolving credit facility.

Share Repurchases

During the fourth quarter, Teradata purchased approximately 3.5 million shares of its stock for $99 million. For the full-year 2015, Teradata acquired approximately 19 million shares for $647 million.

As of the end of 2015, Teradata had approximately $573 million of remaining authorization for share repurchases under its general share repurchase program. The stock is anticipated to be repurchased on an ongoing basis in open market transactions at management’s discretion.

2016 Guidance

Teradata expects to exit the majority of its Marketing Applications business around the end of the first quarter of 2016. As such, Teradata’s GAAP revenue guidance for 2016 includes approximately $40 million of revenue for the Marketing Applications business in the first quarter of 2016, but does not include revenue expectations for the exited business beyond the first quarter of 2016. GAAP revenue guidance for the full year 2016 is expected to be in the $2.315 billion to $2.360 billion range, or down 7 to 8 percent from 2015. On a constant currency basis, GAAP revenue is expected to be down 5 to 7 percent, as Teradata expects 2 percentage points of currency headwind for the full year.

On a non-GAAP basis excluding the Marketing Applications business Teradata expects to exit in 2016, full-year 2016 revenue is expected to be $2.275 billion - $2.320 billion, or down 8 to 10 percent (down 6 to 8 percent on a constant currency basis).(1) Teradata’s 2015 full-year revenue included approximately $152 million of revenue from the Marketing Applications business Teradata expects to exit in 2016. For comparison purposes, when the Marketing Applications business is excluded for both 2015 and 2016, revenue is expected to be down 2 to 4 percent, or flat to down 2 percent in constant currency. 

Full-year 2016 GAAP earnings per share guidance of $1.68 to $1.83 includes the Marketing Applications business for the three months ended March 31, 2016 but excludes any tax expense in connection with the sale of such business. On a non-GAAP basis, which also excludes stock-based compensation expense and other special items, as well as the expected $(7) million after-tax loss from Teradata’s Marketing Applications business in the first quarter of 2016, non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the $2.35 - $2.50 range.(2) Teradata’s Marketing Applications business experienced an approximate $45 million operating loss in 2015. The year over year increase in non-GAAP earnings per share is driven by exiting the Marketing Applications business, as well as the benefits of Teradata’s transformation and cost rationalization initiatives.

Business Transformation

Teradata is making good progress in its business transformation, including the expected exit of its Marketing Applications business, and will provide more information regarding these initiatives during its earnings conference call today as well as later this summer at an Analyst Day.

Relating to the expected exit of the Marketing Applications business, at December 31, 2015 Teradata recorded the “assets held for sale” and “liabilities held for sale” at a current estimate of fair value less expected cost to sell. Future adjustments to these estimates may be necessary as the sale of the business is completed.

Supplemental Financial Information

Additional information regarding Teradata’s operating results is provided below as well as on the Investor Relations page of Teradata’s website.

2.Teradata reports its results in accordance with GAAP. However, as described below, the company believes that certain non-GAAP measures (such as non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, or EPS, which exclude certain items as well as free cash flow) are useful for investors. Our non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as substitutes for, or superior to, results determined in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

Special items included in Teradata’s 2015 fourth quarter GAAP net income included the following items, net of tax: $10 million of stock-based compensation expense; $5 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, $9 million of acquisition transaction, integration and reorganization-related expenses, $34 million for impairment of goodwill and $5 million for a gain on an equity investment.

Special items for Teradata’s 2015 full-year GAAP net income included the following items, net of tax: $41 million of stock-based compensation expense; $25 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; $19 million of acquisition transaction, integration and reorganization-related expenses, $35 million for gains on equity investments, and $366 million for impairment of goodwill.

The following tables reconcile Teradata’s actual and projected results and EPS under GAAP to the company’s actual and projected non-GAAP results and EPS for the periods presented, which exclude certain items. Our management regularly uses supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, such as gross margin, operating income, net income and 

5

EPS, excluding certain items internally, to understand, manage and evaluate our business and support operating decisions. The company believes such non-GAAP financial measures (1) provide useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the company’s ongoing operations, (2) are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations and results, that may be more easily compared to peer companies and allow investors a view of the company’s operating results excluding special items, (3) provide useful information to management and investors regarding present and future business trends, and (4) provide consistency and comparability with past reports and projections of future results.

**Reflects the expectations of the 1Q 2016 results of operations of the portion of the Teradata’s Marketing Applications business that we expect to sell around the end of the first quarter of 2016. However, the GAAP guidance for 2016 currently excludes the incremental tax expense associated with the expected exit of the Marketing Applications business; the current estimated potential impact to GAAP EPS is in the range of $0.40 - $0.45 per share, but the actual expense is highly dependent on a number of variables, including the final terms of the planned sale of the business. Teradata will update its full-year 2016 GAAP expectations after such terms have been finalized. 

3.As described above, the company believes that free cash flow is a useful non-GAAP measure for investors. Teradata defines free cash flow as cash provided/used by operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment, and additions to capitalized software. Free cash flow does not have a uniform definition under GAAP and therefore, Teradata’s definition may differ from other companies’ definitions of this measure. Teradata’s management uses free cash flow to assess the financial performance of the company and believes it is useful for investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations. In particular, free cash flow indicates the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures for, among other things, investment in the company’s existing businesses, strategic acquisitions, strengthening the company’s balance sheet, repurchase of the company’s stock and repayment of the company’s debt obligations, if any. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since there may be other nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, results determined in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
