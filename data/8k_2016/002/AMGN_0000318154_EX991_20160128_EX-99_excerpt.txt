   •   ENBREL sales increased 8 percent year-over-year for the fourth quarter driven by net selling price, offset partially by the impact from inventory changes and competition. Sales increased 14 percent for the full year driven by net selling price, offset partially by the impact from competition.  

   •   Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim) sales decreased 2 percent year-over-year for the fourth quarter driven by lower unit demand and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, offset partially by net selling price. Sales increased 3 percent for the full year driven by net selling price, offset partially by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates.

   •   EPOGEN sales decreased 37 percent year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 9 percent for the full year driven by the impact of competition and, to a lesser extent, the shift in U.S. dialysis customer purchases to Aranesp.  

   •   NEUPOGEN® (filgrastim) sales decreased 4 percent year-over-year for the fourth quarter driven by the impact of competition in the U.S. and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, offset partially by favorable changes in accounting estimates.

   •   Cost of Sales margin improved by 1.6 percentage points year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 1.3 percentage points for the full year driven primarily by manufacturing efficiencies, higher net selling price and lower royalties.  

   •   Research & Development (R&D) expenses decreased 10 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2015 driven by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts, as well as a $60 million upfront payment in the fourth quarter of 2014 related to the Company’s cancer immunotherapy collaboration with Kite Pharma. For the full year, R&D expenses decreased 5 percent driven primarily by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts, offset partially by increased support for launch products.  

   •   Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 3 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 6 percent for the full year driven primarily by investments in new product launches, offset partially by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts.

   •   Adjusted Tax Rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 1.4 percentage points year-over-year driven primarily by a lower benefit from the federal R&D tax credit.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In this news release, management has presented its operating results for the fourth quarters and full years of 2015 and 2014 in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and on an adjusted (or non-GAAP) basis. In addition, management has presented its full year 2016 EPS and tax rate guidance in accordance with GAAP and on an adjusted (or non-GAAP) basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are computed by excluding certain items related to acquisitions, restructuring and certain other items from the related GAAP financial measures. Management has also presented Free Cash Flow (FCF), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the fourth quarters and full years of 2015 and 2014. FCF is computed by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the news release.  

The Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects for the future of the Company’s core business activities by facilitating comparisons of results of core business operations among current, past and future periods. In addition, the Company believes that excluding the non-cash amortization of intangible assets, including developed product technology rights, acquired in business combinations treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company’s acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that FCF provides a further measure of the Company’s liquidity.  

The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures set forth in the news release in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning. The non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments (domestic or foreign) involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products (domestic or foreign), and difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products. In addition, sales of our products are affected by reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payors, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment as well as U.S. legislation affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement. Government and others’ regulations and reimbursement policies may affect the development, usage and pricing of our products. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors. We depend on third parties for a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity for the supply of certain of our current and future products and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to some of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Our efforts to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. We may experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs and not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from our ongoing restructuring plan. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock.

The following table presents the computations for GAAP and Adjusted diluted EPS.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) The adjustments related primarily to non-cash amortization of intangible assets, including developed product technology rights, acquired in business combinations.  

 (b) The adjustments related primarily to non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.  

 (c) The adjustments related to the Internal Revenue Service issuing final regulations that required the recognition of an additional year of the non-tax deductible branded prescription drug fee. 

 (d) The adjustments for the three months ended December 31, 2015, related primarily to a gain recognized on the sale of assets related to our site closures. The adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2015, related primarily to gains recognized on the sale of assets related to our site closures, partially offset by severance expenses. The 2014 adjustments related primarily to severance expenses.  

 (e) The adjustments related to various acquisition-related items.  

 (f) The tax effect of the adjustments between our GAAP and Adjusted results takes into account the tax treatment and related tax rate(s) that apply to each adjustment in the applicable tax jurisdiction(s). Generally, this results in a tax impact at the U.S. marginal tax rate for certain adjustments, including the majority of amortization of intangible assets, whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including restructuring expense, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions. Due to these factors, the effective tax rates for the adjustments to our GAAP income before income taxes, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, were 27.6% and 31.4%, respectively, compared with 32.6% and 31.4% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.  

 (g) The adjustments related primarily to certain prior period items excluded from adjusted earnings.
