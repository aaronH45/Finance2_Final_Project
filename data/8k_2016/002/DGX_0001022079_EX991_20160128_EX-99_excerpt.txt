MADISON, N.J., JANUARY 28, 2016 - Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services, announced today that for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, adjusted income from continuing operations was $157 million, essentially unchanged from 2014. Adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization was $1.19 in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $1.18 in 2014. 

For the fourth quarter of 2015, reported income from continuing operations was $188 million, or $1.29 per diluted share. Reported income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2015 benefitted from the recognition of deferred tax benefits totaling $58 million, or $0.40 per diluted share. This benefit was partially offset by $27 million after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share, of charges primarily related to restructuring and integration costs and ongoing efforts to drive operational excellence. In the fourth quarter of 2014, reported income from continuing operations was $185 million, or $1.26 per diluted share. Reported income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2014 benefited from the favorable resolution of tax contingencies of $44 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. This benefit was partially offset by $17 million after tax, or $0.12 per diluted share, of charges primarily related to restructuring and integration costs and ongoing efforts to drive operational excellence.

Fourth quarter 2015 revenues were $1.85 billion. Revenues grew 0.6% versus the prior year on an equivalent basis, which excludes the fourth quarter 2014 revenues of the clinical trials testing business contributed to the Q2 Solutions joint venture in July 2015. On a reported basis, revenues were lower by 1.8% compared to a year ago. Diagnostic information services revenues grew by 0.4% versus the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, grew by 0.3% versus the prior year and revenue per requisition increased by 0.1%.

For the fourth quarter of 2015, adjusted operating income from continuing operations grew to $288 million, or 15.5% of revenues, compared to $283 million, or 15.0% of revenues, a year ago. For the fourth quarter of 2015, reported operating income from continuing operations was $239 million, or 12.9% of revenues, compared to $257 million, or 13.7% of revenues a year ago. Reported cash provided by operations was $271 million. 

“We finished 2015 with a solid quarter, delivering both revenue and earnings growth. For the year, we increased adjusted operating income by 7.5% as a result of our return to growth and our operational excellence program,” said Steve Rusckowski, President and CEO. “Looking ahead to 2016, the growth we are projecting is based on continued execution of our five point strategy, which includes two recently announced hospital opportunities and the launch of our Data Diagnostics solution with Inovalon.”

Full Year 2015 Performance

Revenues for 2015 were $7.5 billion, an increase of 2% on an equivalent basis. On a reported basis, revenues grew by 0.8% compared to a year ago.

Reported income from continuing operations for 2015 was $709 million, or $4.87 per diluted share, compared to $551 million, or $3.78 per diluted share, in 2014. Reported income from continuing operations in 2015 benefitted from the net gain on the contribution to the clinical trials joint venture and recognition of deferred tax benefits which were partially offset by restructuring and integration charges as well as debt refinancing and other charges.

Adjusted operating income from continuing operations for 2015 grew 7.5% to $1.2 billion, or 16.1% of revenues, compared to $1.1 billion, or 15.0% of revenues, for 2014.

2)Adjusted amounts for operating income, operating income as a percentage of net revenues and income from continuing operations attributable to Quest Diagnostics' stockholders represent the company's results before the impact of special items, such as the gain on contribution of business to clinical trials joint venture, charges on retirement of debt and related refinancing charges, restructuring and integration charges, charges in equity in earnings of equity method investeees, recognition of certain income tax benefits and other items. Adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense represents the company's results before the impact of special items and amortization expense. Revenue on an equivalent basis represents 2014 net revenues excluding clinical trials testing revenues in the third and fourth quarters of 2014. Adjusted cash provided by operations represents cash provided by operations before the cash impact of charges on retirement of debt. Adjusted measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States when comparing results of operations and cash flows from period to period. Adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The following tables reconciles reported results to adjusted results:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(e)For the gain on contribution of business to clinical trials joint venture, the associated deferred tax liability was calculated using a combined tax rate of 43.3% and does not result in any significant current taxes payable. For the charges on retirement of debt and related refinancing charges, income tax benefits were calculated such that the combined tax rate for the full year was 40%. For the restructuring and integration charges and other items, income tax impacts, where recorded, were calculated using combined tax rates of 38.9% and 38.2% for 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(f)Charges in equity in earnings of equity method investees of $5 million, pre-tax, primarily consist of restructuring and integration charges incurred by the clinical trials joint venture.

The income tax benefit was primarily calculated using combined tax rates of 38.9% and 38.2% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The pre-tax amortization expense that is excluded from the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense is recorded in the company's statements of operations as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(j)Represents the portion of the estimated cash tax benefit realized on the retirement of debt in connection with the recent debt refinancing during the three months ended December 31, 2015. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, represents $146 million of pre-tax cash charges on retirement of debt in connection with our recent debt refinancing, net of the estimated cash tax benefit realized.

3)For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the $334 million gain on contribution of business to joint venture represents the gain associated with the contribution of our clinical trials testing business to the clinical trials joint venture.

4)Other operating expense (income), net includes miscellaneous income and expense items related to operating activities. For the three months ended December 31, 2015, other operating expense (income), net principally includes non-cash asset impairment charges associated with winding down a subsidiary. Other operating expense (income), net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, principally includes non-cash asset impairment charges primarily associated with Celera Products and the winding down of another subsidiary, partially offset by a gain of $13 million associated with a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with our Summit Health acquisition. 

For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, other operating expense (income), net includes a gain of $9 million associated with a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with the Summit Health acquisition.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, other income (expense), net includes $144 million of pre-tax charges on the retirement of debt associated with the Tender Offer and Redemption. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

7)The outlook for adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense represents management’s estimates for the full year 2016 before the impact of special items and amortization expense. This measure is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to the corresponding amount determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States since it is meaningful to evaluate the company’s ongoing operating performance. Adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding amount determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

The following table reconciles our 2016 outlook for adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense to the corresponding amount determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Represents the estimated impact of amortization expense for 2016 on the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense. Amortization expense used in the calculation is as follows (dollars in millions):

8)The outlook for 1.5% to 2.5% revenue growth on an equivalent basis in 2016 represents management’s estimates for 2016 versus reported 2015 revenues adjusted to exclude the 2015 revenues from the clinical trials testing business. In 2015, the company contributed its clinical trials testing business to the clinical trials joint venture. Consequently, our 2016 revenues will not include revenues associated with that business. Revenues for 2015 have been adjusted to exclude clinical trials testing revenues to provide an equivalent basis for our growth outlook. 

The following table reconciles our 2015 net revenues determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States with equivalent revenue for 2015:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)The 2015 excluded revenue is comprised of clinical trials testing revenues reported in the first and second quarters of 2015.
