CEO Comments 

Michael Kneeland, chief executive officer of United Rentals, said, "While 2015 proved to be challenging in many ways, it also showcased the resilience and flexibility of our business. Our full year adjusted EBITDA dollars and margin were both records for our company, as was our strong free cash flow after capex. This was a solid performance in light of the decline in upstream oil and gas and its knock-on effects, particularly in Canada."

Kneeland continued, "Although we agree with industry forecasters that there is further growth ahead, there is still market uncertainty. For 2016, our stance is to be cautious on capex and proactive about pursuing profitable growth opportunities in areas such as our specialty rental services. In the first quarter, we plan to spend less than half of the capex we spent in the first quarter last year, and we’ll adjust our full year spend up or down based on the level of demand we experience. We expect to use our nearly billion dollars of free cash flow this year to buy back shares and pay down debt."

2016 Outlook

The company provided the following outlook for the full year 2016:

4.Used equipment sales adjusted gross margin excludes the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired RSC fleet that was sold.

5.Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure as defined in the table below. 

Free Cash Flow and Fleet Size

For the full year 2015, free cash flow was $919 million after total rental and non-rental capital expenditures of $1.636 billion.

The size of the rental fleet was $8.73 billion of original equipment cost at December 31, 2015, compared with $8.44 billion at December 31, 2014. The age of the rental fleet was 43.1 months on an OEC-weighted basis at December 31, 2015, compared with 43.0 months at December 31, 2014.

Share Repurchase Programs

In 2015, the company repurchased $648 million of common stock to complete the $750 million share repurchase program that was announced in December 2014. 

In July 2015, the company's board of directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which the company intends to complete within 18 months of its initiation in November 2015. The company repurchased $110 million of common stock by year-end 2015 under this share repurchase program.

Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) 

Return on invested capital was 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was flat year-over-year. The company’s ROIC metric uses after-tax operating income for the trailing 12 months divided by average stockholders’ equity (deficit), debt and deferred taxes, net of average cash. To mitigate the volatility related to fluctuations in the company’s tax rate from period to period, the federal statutory tax rate of 35% is used to calculate after-tax operating income. 

During the three months ended December 31, 2015, the company adopted an accounting standard that requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the associated debt liability. This change in accounting results in a reduction in debt which in turn reduces invested capital and slightly increases ROIC. For the ROIC calculation, the company adjusted its previously reported ROIC to reflect the current debt presentation. This accounting change didn't result in significant changes to either ROIC (for the year ended December 31, 2014, the ROIC calculated using the new debt definition of 8.8% didn't change from the previously reported ROIC) or the year-over-year change in ROIC (ROIC for the year ended December 31, 2015, was flat year-over-year under both the old and new debt definitions). When adjusting the denominator of the ROIC calculation to also exclude average goodwill, ROIC was 11.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of 10 basis points from the year ended December 31, 2014. ROIC excluding average goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 12.0% calculated using the new debt definition as compared to 11.9% as previously reported.

Conference Call 

United Rentals will hold a conference call tomorrow, Thursday, January 28, 2016, at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The conference call number is 866-814-8399 (international: 703-639-1366). The conference call will also be available live by audio webcast at unitedrentals.com, where it will be archived until the next earnings call. The replay number for the call is 703-925-2533, passcode is 1668111.

Non-GAAP Measures  

Free cash flow, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share (adjusted EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of rental and non-rental equipment plus proceeds from sales of rental and non-rental equipment, and excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired RSC fleet. Adjusted EPS represents EPS plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, the impact on interest expense related to the fair value adjustment of acquired RSC indebtedness, the impact on depreciation related to acquired RSC fleet and property and equipment, the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired RSC fleet, merger related intangible asset amortization and the loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities and amendment of ABL facility. The company believes that: (i) free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements; (ii) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth; and (iii) adjusted EPS provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, none of these measures should be considered as alternatives to net income, cash flows from operating activities or earnings per share under GAAP as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. Information reconciling forward-looking free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed, and actual results may differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the challenges associated with past or future acquisitions, such as undiscovered liabilities, costs, integration issues and/or the inability to achieve the cost and revenue synergies expected; (2) a slowdown in North American construction and industrial activities, which occurred during the economic downturn and significantly affected our revenues and profitability, could reduce demand for equipment and prices that we can charge; (3) our significant indebtedness, which requires us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow for debt service and can constrain our flexibility in responding to unanticipated or adverse business conditions; (4) the inability to refinance our indebtedness at terms that are favorable to us, or at all; (5) the incurrence of additional debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness; (6) noncompliance with covenants in our debt agreements, which could result in termination of our credit facilities and acceleration of outstanding borrowings; (7) restrictive covenants and amount of borrowings permitted under our debt agreements, which could limit our financial and operational flexibility; (8) an overcapacity of fleet in the equipment rental industry; (9) a decrease in levels of infrastructure spending, including lower than expected government funding for construction projects; (10) fluctuations in the price of our common stock and inability to complete stock repurchases in the time frame and/or on the terms anticipated; (11) our rates and time utilization being less than anticipated; (12) our inability to manage credit risk adequately or to collect on contracts with customers; (13) our inability to access the capital that our business or growth plans may require; (14) the incurrence of impairment charges; (15) trends in oil and natural gas could adversely affect demand for our services and products; (16) our dependence on distributions from subsidiaries as a result of our holding company structure and the fact that such distributions could be limited by contractual or legal restrictions; (17) an increase in our loss reserves to address business operations or other claims and any claims that exceed our established levels of reserves; (18) the incurrence of additional costs and expenses (including indemnification obligations) in connection with litigation, regulatory or investigatory matters; (19) the outcome or other potential consequences of litigation and other claims and regulatory matters relating to our business, including certain claims that our insurance may not cover; (20) the effect that certain provisions in our charter and certain debt agreements and our significant indebtedness may have of making more difficult or otherwise discouraging, delaying or deterring a takeover or other change of control of us; (21) management turnover and inability to attract and retain key personnel; (22) our costs being more than anticipated and/or the inability to realize expected savings in the amounts or time frames planned; (23) our dependence on key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms; (24) our inability to sell our new or used fleet in the amounts, or at the prices, we expect; (25) competition from existing and new competitors; (26) security breaches, cybersecurity attacks and other significant disruptions in our information technology systems; (27) the costs of complying with environmental, safety and foreign laws and regulations, as well as other risks associated with non-U.S. operations, including currency exchange risk; (28) labor difficulties and labor-based legislation affecting our labor relations and operations generally; and (29) increases in our maintenance and replacement costs and/or decreases in the residual value of our equipment.

ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GAAP RECONCILIATION

We define “earnings per share – adjusted” as the sum of earnings per share – GAAP, as reported plus the impact of the following special items: merger related costs, merger related intangible asset amortization, impact on rental depreciation related to acquired RSC fleet and property and equipment, impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired RSC fleet, impact on interest expense related to fair value adjustment of acquired RSC indebtedness, restructuring charge and loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities and amendment of ABL facility. Management believes that earnings per share - adjusted provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, earnings per share - adjusted is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, earnings per share - adjusted should not be considered an alternative to GAAP earnings per share. The table below provides a reconciliation between earnings per share – GAAP, as reported, and earnings per share – adjusted.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Primarily reflects transaction costs associated with the April 2014 National Pump acquisition. The income for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects a decline in the fair value of the contingent cash consideration component of the National Pump purchase price.

(2)Reflects the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the RSC and National Pump acquisitions.

(3)Reflects the impact of extending the useful lives of equipment acquired in the RSC acquisition, net of the impact of additional depreciation associated with the fair value mark-up of such equipment.

(4)Reflects additional costs recorded in cost of rental equipment sales associated with the fair value mark-up of rental equipment acquired in the RSC acquisition and subsequently sold.

(5)Reflects a reduction of interest expense associated with the fair value mark-up of debt acquired in the RSC acquisition. 

(6)Reflects severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our closed restructuring programs and our current restructuring program.

EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA GAAP RECONCILIATION

(In millions)

EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment, and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired RSC fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company’s results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliation, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. The table below provides a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(A) Our EBITDA margin was 47.1% and 47.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and 47.7% and 45.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(B) Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.9% and 49.6% for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and 48.7% and 47.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(3)Represents non-cash, share-based payments associated with the granting of equity instruments.

(4)Reflects additional costs recorded in cost of rental equipment sales associated with the fair value mark-up of rental equipment acquired in the RSC acquisition and subsequently sold.

FREE CASH FLOW GAAP RECONCILIATION 

(In millions)

We define free cash flow as (i) net cash provided by operating activities less (ii) purchases of rental and non-rental equipment plus (iii) proceeds from sales of rental and non-rental equipment, and excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements. However, free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. Accordingly, free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. The table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow.
