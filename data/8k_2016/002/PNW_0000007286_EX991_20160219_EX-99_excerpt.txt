PINNACLE WEST REPORTS 2015 FULL-YEAR AND FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS

•Full-year results benefit from superior operational performance and cost management

•Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station repeats record-breaking performance

•Fourth-quarter results positively impacted by lower O&M costs, favorable weather and higher retail energy sales

PHOENIX – Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $437.3 million, or $3.92 per diluted share, for full-year 2015. This result compares with net income of $397.6 million, or $3.58 per share, in 2014.

“Strong operational performance, improving economic conditions and an increase in retail customer sales helped us achieve solid year-end results at the top of our earnings guidance,” said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Don Brandt. “Our employees remain focused on creating value for customers and shareholders, including consistently working to minimize our costs, while maintaining reliable electric service.”

Brandt said “superb performance at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station continues to benefit customers and our bottom line.” Palo Verde achieved its 24th consecutive year as the nation’s largest power producer and, for the eleventh time, exceeded its own record for power generation – producing 32.5 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of carbon-free electricity. Palo Verde remains the only U.S. generating facility to ever produce more than 30 million megawatt-hours in a year, an operational feat accomplished 11 separate times. In addition, the plant’s three units achieved a capacity factor of 94 percent.

Brandt cited several additional examples of the Company’s 2015 achievements:

•For the fourth straight year, Pinnacle West increased its common dividend, raising it by 5.04 percent.

•The company proactively retired an additional 260 MW of coal generation in 2015, bringing its total amount retired since 2013 to 820 MW. As a result of these unit closures, the greenhouse gas emissions in the region will be reduced by almost six million metric tons per year, the equivalent of taking 1.28 million cars off the road.

•With completion of two additional 10-MW projects under the company’s solar program (AZ Sun) and the growing APS Solar Partner residential rooftop solar program, which is more than halfway toward its goal of 1,500 APS-owned installations, Arizona Public Service now has more than 900 MW of solar available to its customers.

•APS’s reliability for 2015 remained among the strongest in the industry despite one of the most challenging storm seasons in recent Arizona history. Powerful summer storms interrupted service to hundreds of thousands of customers. Nonetheless, the majority of customers were restored within 24 hours after each storm. For the year, the typical APS customer experienced less than one outage (0.82) on average (compared to a national industry median of 1.025 interruptions).

•APS ranked first in the West, and second in the nation, for most trusted brands among business customers of the 59 largest utilities in the U.S. by Cogent Reports, a division of Market Strategies International.

•All three major credit agencies rank both Pinnacle West’s and APS’s corporate credit ratings the equivalent of A- or higher, including Fitch and Moody’s, both of which upgraded the company one notch in May and June 2015, respectively. These ratings represent the company’s highest credit ratings since 1984.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, Pinnacle West reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $41.1 million, or $0.37 per diluted share. This result compares with net income of $5.4 million, or $0.05 per share, for the same period a year ago.

The 2015 fourth-quarter results comparison was positively impacted by the following major factors:

•Lower operations and maintenance expenses increased results by $0.21 per share compared with the prior-year period. The lower expenses were largely the result of a reduction in planned fossil plant maintenance in the 2015 fourth quarter compared to the 2014 fourth quarter, as well as lower employee benefit costs.

The O&M variance excludes costs associated with renewable energy, demand side management and similar regulatory programs, which are largely offset by comparable amounts of operating revenues.

•Adjustment mechanisms improved earnings by $0.12 per share compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. These adjustors included a Jan. 1, 2015, rate change reflecting acquisition of Southern California Edison’s interest in Units 4 and 5 of the Four Corners Power Plant; increased transmission revenues; revenue from the Company’s AZ Sun Program; and higher lost fixed cost recovery (LFCR) revenue.

•Higher retail electricity sales – excluding the effects of weather variations, but including the effects of customer conservation, energy efficiency programs and distributed renewable generation – improved results $0.04 per share. Weather-normalized sales increased 0.6 percent, while total customer growth improved 1.3 percent quarter-over-quarter. Underlining an improving Arizona economy, weather-adjusted sales growth has been positive three of the past four quarters and full-year sales growth increased 0.7 percent. This pattern demonstrates that customer and usage growth outpaced the impacts of energy efficiency and distributed generation initiatives. 

•The effects of weather variations improved the Company’s earnings by $0.04 per share. Highlighted by November and December weather that was colder than normal, heating degree-days (a measure of the effects of weather) were about 60 percent greater than what they were in the 2014 fourth quarter and more than 30 percent better than normal 

10-year historical averages. In addition, October residential cooling degree-days were 204 percent greater than a year ago.

•The net effect of miscellaneous items increased earnings $0.01 per share.

The above positive factors were offset in part by higher depreciation and amortization expenses, largely associated with the Four Corners transaction and additional plant in service, which reduced earnings by $0.10 per share.

Financial Outlook

For 2016, the Company continues to expect its on-going consolidated earnings will be within a range of $3.90 to $4.10 per diluted share, on a weather-normalized basis, and to achieve a consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5 percent.
