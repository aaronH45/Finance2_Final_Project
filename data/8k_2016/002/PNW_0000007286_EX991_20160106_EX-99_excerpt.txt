Powering Growth, Delivering Value2 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This presentation contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, including statements regarding our earnings guidance and financial outlook and goals. These forward-looking statements are often identified by words such as “estimate,” “predict,” “may,” “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “require,” “intend,” “assume” and similar words. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. A number of factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results, or from outcomes currently expected or sought by Pinnacle West or APS. These factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to manage capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs while maintaining high reliability and customer service levels; variations in demand for electricity, including those due to weather, the general economy, customer and sales growth (or decline), and the effects of energy conservation measures and distributed generation; power plant and transmission system performance and outages; competition in retail and wholesale power markets; regulatory and judicial decisions, developments and proceedings; new legislation or regulation, including those relating to environmental requirements, nuclear plant operations and potential deregulation of retail electric markets; fuel and water supply availability; our ability to achieve timely and adequate rate recovery of our costs, including returns on debt and equity capital; our ability to meet renewable energy and energy efficiency mandates and recover related costs; risks inherent in the operation of nuclear facilities, including spent fuel disposal uncertainty; current and future economic conditions in Arizona, particularly in real estate markets; the development of new technologies which may affect electric sales or delivery; the cost of debt and equity capital and the ability to access capital markets when required; environmental and other concerns surrounding coal-fired generation; volatile fuel and purchased power costs; the investment performance of the assets of our nuclear decommissioning trust, pension, and other postretirement benefit plans and the resulting impact on future funding requirements; the liquidity of wholesale power markets and the use of derivative contracts in our business; potential shortfalls in insurance coverage; new accounting requirements or new interpretations of existing requirements; generation, transmission and distribution facility and system conditions and operating costs; the ability to meet the anticipated future need for additional generation and associated transmission facilities in our region; the willingness or ability of our counterparties, power plant participants and power plant land owners to meet contractual or other obligations or extend the rights for continued power plant operations; and restrictions on dividends or other provisions in our credit agreements and ACC orders. These and other factors are discussed in Risk Factors described in Part I, Item 1A of the Pinnacle West/APS Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, and in Part II, Item 1A of the Pinnacle West/APS Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, which you should review carefully before placing any reliance on our financial statements, disclosures or earnings outlook. Neither Pinnacle West nor APS assumes any obligation to update these statements, even if our internal estimates change, except as required by law.

Powering Growth, Delivering Value17 Regional Haze / BART (SCR) Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants (ACI + Baghouse) Coal Combustion Residuals Cooling Water Intake Structures – CWA 316(b) EPA Ruling Announced in 1999, with site-specific requirements announced more recently MATS compliance by April 2015, with potential for one-year extension Announced on December 19, 2014 (Subtitle D) Announced in May 2014 Four Corners Units 4 & 5 Approximately $400M for SCRs in 2015-2018 (does not include CAPEX related to El Paso’s 7% interest) $0 APS estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the CCR rule for Four Corners is approximately $15 million, and its share of incremental costs for Cholla is approximately $85 million. APS expects to incur certain of these costs during 2015- 2017 timeframe. Immaterial $0Cholla Unit 3 On September 11, 2014, APS announced a proposal to close Unit 2 by April 2016 and stop burning coal at the other APS-owned units (1 and 3) by the mid-2020’s. If EPA does not approve the plan, SCR for Unit 3 would cost approximately $100 million. $11M Navajo Plant Units 1-3 Up to ~$200M for SCRs and baghouses On July 28, 2014, EPA issued the final BART rule incorporating the better-than-BART alternative proposed by SRP and others SRP, the operating agent, is evaluating compliance options Approximately $1 million To be determined ENVIRONMENTAL PLAN Regional Haze compliance is the biggest driver of environmental spend over the next few years Clean Power Plan: On August 3, 2015, the U.S. EPA issued its final rules to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants including those on Tribal lands. APS is reviewing the rules, while working closely with other utilities, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, the ACC, tribal officials and other impacted stakeholders to determine how best to proceed. Note: Dollars shown at ownership. Estimates as of September 30, 2015. • Cholla: Unit 1 is not BART-eligible; Unit 2 retired on October 1, 2015; Unit 4 is owned by PacifiCorp. • The MATS Rule has been remanded to the D.C. Circuit Court. • SO2 NAAQS and greenhouse gas-related costs will be determined based upon EPA rule makings, with no spend occurring before 2016. • ACI = Activated Carbon Injection; NAAQS = National Ambient Air Quality Standard; SCR = Selective Catalytic Reduction control technology  

Powering Growth, Delivering Value18 Emissions • 820 MW of coal has been retired including 560 MW at Four Corners Units 1-3 in 2013 and 260 MW at Cholla Unit 2 as of October 1, 2015. • Four Corners: 2013 transaction to purchase Southern California Edison’s ownership in Units 4 and 5 and closure of units 1, 2 & 3 leads to expected reductions of emissions; particulates are expected to decline by 43%, NOx by 36%, CO2 by 30%, mercury by 61% and SO2 by 24%. • Cholla Power Plant: Closure of Unit 2 as of October 1, 2015 will reduce mercury emissions by 51%, particulates by 34%, NOx by 32%, and CO2 and SO2 by 23% each. We also announced plans to work with the U.S. EPA to stop burning coal at our remaining Cholla units by the mid-2020s • Navajo Generating Station: Plan proposed by a group of stakeholders, including SRP, the operating agent, was approved by the EPA in 2014. The plan will achieve even greater NOx emission reductions than the EPA’s proposal • Participated in Carbon Disclosure Project since 2006 COAL FLEET STRATEGY APS’s proactive approach to reducing emissions leads to coal’s expected share of the energy mix being reduced to 17% 27% 18% 35% 17% 19% 35% 10% 15% 9% 15% 2015 2029 P e r c e n t o f P o r t f o l i o M W h EE/DR Renewable Energy Natural Gas Coal Nuclear Source: Data shown is based on the Integrated Resource Plan Supplement filed September 17, 2014
