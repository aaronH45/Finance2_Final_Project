Business Segments  

Electric Transmission & Distribution  

The electric transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $109 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, consisting of $84 million from the regulated electric transmission & distribution utility operations (TDU) and $25 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $113 million, consisting of $85 million from the TDU and $28 million related to securitization bonds.  

Operating income for the year ended Dec. 31, 2015, was $607 million, consisting of $502 million from the TDU and $105 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the same period of 2014 was $595 million, consisting of $477 million from the TDU and $118 million related to securitization bonds.  

Full year 2015 operating income for the TDU benefited from higher transmission and distribution related revenues, revenue increases associated with the addition of nearly 50,000 metered customers, as well as higher usage due to a return to more normal weather. These increases were partially offset by lower equity return related to true-up proceeds, lower energy efficiency bonus, including the absence of a one-time energy efficiency remand bonus received in 2014, higher depreciation and lower right of way revenues.  

Natural Gas Distribution  

The natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $97 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with $103 million for the same period of 2014.  

Operating income for the year ended Dec. 31, 2015, was $273 million compared with $287 million in 2014.  

Full year 2015 operating income for natural gas distribution decreased as a result of lower usage from a return to more normal weather and higher depreciation and amortization. This decrease was partially offset by revenue from rate increases associated with capital investment and revenue from customer growth of approximately 30,000 new customers.  

Energy Services  

The energy services segment reported operating income of $13 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, which included a mark-to-market accounting gain of $1 million, compared with $9 million for the same period of 2014, which included a mark-to-market accounting gain of $6 million. Excluding mark-to-market gains, operating income increased $9 million versus 2014.  

Operating income for the year ended Dec. 31, 2015, was $42 million, which included a mark-to-market gain of $4 million, compared with $52 million in 2014, which included a mark-to-market gain of $29 million. Excluding mark-to-market gains, the $15 million increase in 2015 was primarily due to operations and maintenance expense reductions, a lower inventory write down and improved margins.

Midstream Investments  

The midstream investments segment reported an equity loss of $934 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, which includes the impairment charges noted above. The impairments noted above were partially offset by earnings of $50 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Earnings were $67 million for the same period of 2014.  

For the year ended Dec. 31, 2015, the segment reported an equity loss of $1,633 million, which includes the impairment charges noted above. The impairments noted above were partially offset by full-year earnings of $213 million. Earnings were $308 million for the full year of 2014.  

Earnings Outlook  

On a consolidated basis, CenterPoint Energy expects earnings on a guidance basis for 2016 in the range of $1.12—$1.20 per diluted share. This guidance includes anticipated utility operations earnings of $0.88—$0.92 per diluted share and midstream investment earnings of $0.24—$0.28 per diluted share.  

CenterPoint Energy is targeting 4-6 percent earnings per share annual growth through 2018 on a guidance basis, inclusive of midstream investments.  

The utility operations guidance range considers performance to date and certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as weather, regulatory and judicial proceedings, throughput, commodity prices, effective tax rates, and financing activities.  

In providing this guidance, the company does not include other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, earnings from the change in the value of the ZENS securities and the related stocks, or the timing effects of mark-to-market accounting in the company’s energy service business.  

In providing guidance for midstream investments, the company assumes a 55.4 percent limited partner ownership interest in Enable Midstream and includes the amortization of our basis differential in Enable Midstream. The company’s guidance takes into account such factors as Enable Midstream’s most recent public outlook for 2016 dated Feb. 17, 2016, and effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts such as any changes in accounting standards, impairments or Enable Midstream’s unusual items.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In addition to presenting its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), CenterPoint Energy also provides guidance based on adjusted diluted earnings per share, and adjusted net income to reflect the impact of the impairments, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share to the basis used in providing 2015 guidance and net income, adjusted for the impairments, is provided in this news release.  

Management evaluates financial performance in part based on adjusted diluted earnings per share and believes that presenting this non-GAAP financial measure enhances an investor’s understanding of CenterPoint Energy’s overall financial performance by providing them with an additional meaningful and relevant comparison of current and anticipated future results across periods by excluding items that Management does not believe most accurately reflect its fundamental business performance, which items include the items reflected in the reconciliation table of this news release. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered as a supplement and complement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
