 DENVER & MONTREAL--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 11, 2016--Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE: TAP; TSX: TPX) today reported a 11.3 percent decrease in underlying after-tax income for the fourth quarter 2015, driven by unfavorable foreign currency movements, increased brand investments, and the termination of major business contracts this year. On a U.S. GAAP basis, the Company reported a $59.8 million decrease in net income to $33.4 million. These results are in line with the Company's preliminary financial results that were released on January 26, 2016.  

 Molson Coors President and Chief Executive Officer Mark Hunter said, “The most important strategic development for Molson Coors in 2015 was the definitive agreement we reached late in the year to purchase the 58 percent of MillerCoors that we do not currently own, along with the international rights to the Miller brands. This is a game-changing transaction for our company that is compelling both financially and strategically. Last month, we conducted a common stock offering that will fund about 20 percent of the total purchase price and is one step in maintaining investment grade ratings on our debt. We plan to fund the balance of the purchase price with new debt and cash on hand. With regard to business performance, the financial results we released this morning are in line with the preliminary fourth quarter financial results and updated 2015 free cash flow guidance ranges we issued two weeks ago. Overall, we were pleased with the progress that our company made in 2015. We exceeded our targets for cash generation and cost savings and expanded underlying gross and pretax margins globally. We grew our above premium business globally, including craft, flavored malt beverages and cider; we gained share of the key premium light segment in the U.S.; and accelerated the growth of our International business, including a bolt-on acquisition in the fast-growing India market. We continued to focus on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positions through incremental marketing investments, and continuing to premiumize our portfolio. We began to see the benefits flow to our top-line performance as the year progressed. For example, Coors Light and Miller Lite both gained share of the premium light segment in the U.S. in the last three quarters of 2015, and Coors Light grew 0.3 percent globally and more than 15 percent in our Europe and International markets. In constant currency, we achieved positive net pricing globally, as well as in most of our major markets. These achievements are against a backdrop of a continued difficult economy and competitive pressures, along with significant unfavorable foreign currency and the termination of major business contracts, as we highlighted through last year."  

 Mark continued, "We also used our Profit After Capital Charge, or PACC, model as the key driver for our cash and capital allocation decisions. As a result, we drove additional working capital improvements and delivered underlying free cash flow of $704 million for the year, which exceeded our original guidance by more than $150 million, or nearly 30 percent. PACC informed our approach to the MillerCoors acquisition, along with the Mount Shivalik Breweries, Staropramen U.K. and Rekorderlig transactions, and the substantial restructure of our China business last year."  

 Underlying EBITDA and Free Cash Flow  

 Underlying EBITDA was $227.3 million in the fourth quarter, a 17.0 percent decrease from a year ago primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency movements and terminated contracts.  

 Underlying free cash flow for the year totaled $704.3 million. This represents a decrease of $252.4 million from the prior year, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency, lower underlying income, higher capital expenditures and higher cash paid for taxes, partially offset by favorable impact from working capital changes.  

 Stock Repurchases  

 As previously announced, during the quarter, we suspended our four-year, $1 billion stock buy-back program as we focus on financing the pending MillerCoors transaction. During the quarter, we used $50 million of cash to repurchase 555,942 Class B common shares from October through December.  

 Foreign Exchange  

 The Company’s fourth quarter underlying consolidated pretax income includes the negative effect of foreign currency movements totaling $6.1 million. Negative currency impacts in the quarter were $6.9 million in Canada, $0.5 million in Europe, and $0.4 million in International. Foreign currency movements were $1.7 million positive in Corporate.  

 Effective Income Tax Rates  

 The Company’s fourth quarter effective income tax rate was 18.7 percent on a reported basis and 13.9 percent on an underlying basis. On a reported basis, the effective tax rate was lower than prior year primarily due to lower pretax income, as well as discrete and other tax benefits. On an underlying basis, the effective tax rate was lower than prior year primarily due to the geographic mix of income and certain discrete tax benefits.  

 Debt  

 Total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $2.937 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $430.9 million, resulting in net debt of $2.507 billion, which is lower than the prior year, primarily due to foreign currency movements.  

 Fourth Quarter Business Segment Results  

 The following are the Company’s fourth quarter 2015 results by business segment:  

 United States Business (MillerCoors)(2)  

 Molson Coors underlying U.S. segment equity income decreased 10.4 percent to $80.6 million in the quarter.  

 MillerCoors Operating and Financial Highlights  

 MillerCoors underlying net income for the quarter decreased 10.2 percent to $191.5 million, driven by lower volume and increased investments in marketing and information technology, partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, net pricing growth and positive sales mix.  

 MillerCoors domestic sales-to-retailers volume (STRs) declined 2.2 percent for the quarter, driven by continued softness in the below premium segment. Domestic sales-to-wholesalers volume (STWs) decreased 3.1 percent. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned-distributor sales, grew 1.5 percent due to favorable net pricing and positive sales mix. Total MillerCoors net revenue per hectoliter, including contract brewing and company-owned-distributor sales, increased 1.3 percent. Contract brewing volumes decreased 4.1 percent.  

 Cost of goods sold (COGS) per hectoliter decreased 3.4 percent, driven by lower aluminum, fuel, corn and malt pricing, along with supply chain cost savings. The reduction in total COGS per hectoliter was partially offset by brewery and freight inflation and fixed-cost absorption due to lower volumes. Marketing, general and administrative (MG&A) expense increased 14.2 percent, driven by higher brand investments and information technology investments.  

 Depreciation and amortization expenses for MillerCoors were $104.4 million in the fourth quarter, which includes accelerated depreciation related to the planned closure of the Eden brewery of $39.5 million. Additions to tangible and intangible assets totaled $145.7 million in the fourth quarter.  

 Canada Business  

 Canada underlying pretax income decreased 32.0 percent to $51.8 million in the quarter, partially due to $6.9 million of negative foreign currency impact in the quarter. On a constant-currency basis, underlying pretax income decreased 23.0 percent, driven by higher brand investments, increased distribution costs, and fixed-cost deleverage related to lower volume.  

 STRs decreased 6.8 percent on a reported basis in the fourth quarter due to the termination of the Miller brands agreement. Excluding the Miller brands from our results(3), our STRs declined 2.9 percent and our market share declined approximately one percentage point. Molson Coors Canada sales volume decreased 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter. Net sales per hectoliter increased 0.5 percent in local currency, driven by positive net pricing.  

 COGS per hectoliter increased 2.0 percent in local currency, due to input cost inflation, mix shift to higher-cost brands, volume deleverage, and foreign currency movements, partially offset by cost savings. MG&A expense increased 4.2 percent in local currency, driven by higher brand investments.  

 Europe Business  

 Europe underlying pretax income decreased 5.5 percent to $36.2 million in the quarter, partially due to $0.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency movements. On a constant-currency basis, underlying pretax income decreased 4.2 percent, driven by the termination of the Modelo brands and Heineken brewing contracts in the U.K. and higher brand amortization expense.  

 Europe sales volume decreased 0.2 percent, driven by the loss of the Modelo brands in the U.K., which was largely offset by strong growth in Coors Light, Doom Bar and Bergenbier. Europe net sales per hectoliter decreased 2.8 percent in local currency, primarily due to the loss of contract brewing revenue and the Modelo brands in the U.K., along with slightly lower pricing in the quarter.  

 COGS per hectoliter decreased 3.1 percent in local currency, driven by the elimination of Modelo brand costs and lower contract brewing volume in the U.K.  

 MG&A expense decreased 3.4 percent in local currency, primarily driven by lower spending as a result of efficiency in marketing investments, partially offset by higher brand amortization expense.  

 International Business  

 The International segment posted an underlying pretax loss of $5.1 million in the fourth quarter, versus a loss of $3.9 million a year ago, driven by sales mix and higher investment in new markets, partially offset by higher volume in India and Latin America, along with lower MG&A expenses primarily driven by the substantial restructure of our China business in 2015. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted underlying pretax results by $0.4 million in the fourth quarter.  

 Total International sales volume, including royalty volume, increased 12.4 percent, driven by strong volume growth in India, primarily due to our acquisition of Mount Shivalik Breweries early in 2015, along with double-digit Coors Light growth in Latin America. Net sales per hectoliter decreased 15.0 percent, driven by sales mix changes and foreign currency movements.  

 COGS per hectoliter decreased 5.3 percent, due to sales mix changes and foreign currency movements. International MG&A expense decreased 7.5 percent, due to lower marketing investments and overhead costs, primarily related to the substantial restructuring of our China business, as well as foreign currency movements.  

 Corporate  

 Underlying Corporate pretax loss totaled $57.2 million for the fourth quarter, an $8.6 million improvement versus a $65.8 million loss in the prior year, driven by lower interest expense and favorable foreign currency movements.  

 Special and Other Non-Core Items(4)  

 The following special and other non-core items have been excluded from underlying results.  

 During the quarter, Molson Coors recognized net special charges of $10.9 million. These charges were primarily driven by restructuring costs of $3.5 million and $2.1 million in Europe and Canada, respectively, associated with closing certain breweries as a part of our continued strategic review of our supply chain network. Related to these brewery closures, we also recognized asset abandonment costs of $1.2 million in Canada related to the Vancouver brewery, and $4.1 million in Europe primarily related to the closure of our Plovdiv brewery and the proposed closure of our Burton South brewery.  

 During the quarter, MillerCoors recognized special charges of $82.1 million related to the planned closure of the Eden, North Carolina, brewery and early settlement of a portion of the MillerCoors pension plan liability. Our proportionate share of these special charges, net of tax, is $34.4 million.  

 Other non-core items resulted in an $18.8 million loss, which was driven by unrealized mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges of $4.9 million, as well as financing and acquisition related charges associated with the pending acquisition of the remaining 58 percent of MillerCoors and the international rights to the Miller brands.

In addition, constant-currency results exclude the impact of foreign currency movements. For further details regarding these adjustments, please see the section “Special and Other Non-Core Items,” along with tables for reconciliations to the nearest U.S. GAAP measures. Unless otherwise indicated, all $ amounts are in U.S. Dollars, and all quarterly comparative results are for the Company’s fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, compared to the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, all per-hectoliter calculations exclude contract brewing and non-owned factored beverage volume in the denominator but include the financial impact of these sales in the numerator, unless otherwise indicated. Some numbers may not sum due to rounding.  

 (2) MillerCoors, a U.S. joint venture of Molson Coors Brewing Company and SABMiller plc, was launched on July 1, 2008. Molson Coors has a 42 percent economic interest in MillerCoors, which is accounted for using the equity method. Molson Coors’ interest in MillerCoors results, along with certain adjustments under U.S. GAAP, is reflected in “Equity Income in MillerCoors.” This release includes reconciliation from MillerCoors Net Income to Molson Coors Brewing Company Equity Income in MillerCoors and Non-GAAP U.S. Segment Underlying Pretax Income (see Table 8). On November 11, 2015, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire all of SABMiller’s 58 percent interest in MillerCoors and all trademarks, contracts and other assets primarily related to the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Following the closing of the pending acquisition, the Company will own 100 percent of the outstanding equity and voting interests of MillerCoors.  

 (3) Excludes Miller brands from our Canada STR results in fourth quarter 2014 and 2015. On March 31, 2015, our licensing agreement with Miller Brewing Company ("Miller") was terminated, and control of the brands reverted to Miller International. On November 11, 2015, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire all of SABMiller’s 58 percent interest in MillerCoors and all trademarks, contracts and other assets primarily related to the Miller brand portfolio outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Following the closing of the pending acquisition, the Company will own the Miller brands globally.

 Forward-Looking Statements  

 This press release includes estimates or projections that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. Generally, the words “believe,” "expect,” "intend,” "anticipate,” “project,” “will,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historic in nature. Although the Company believes that the assumptions upon which its forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these assumptions will prove to be correct. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s historical experience, and present projections and expectations are disclosed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These factors include, among others, our ability to successfully close, finance and integrate the acquisition of MillerCoors; our ability to achieve expected tax benefits, accretion and cost synergies; our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for the acquisition of MillerCoors; impact of increased competition resulting from further consolidation of brewers, competitive pricing and product pressures; health of the beer industry and our brands in our markets; economic conditions in our markets; additional impairment charges; our ability to maintain manufacturer/distribution agreements; changes in our supply chain system; availability or increase in the cost of packaging materials; success of our joint ventures; risks relating to operations in developing and emerging markets; changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of distribution systems; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; increase in the cost of commodities used in the business; the impact of climate change and the availability and quality of water; loss or closure of a major brewery or other key facility; our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, including executing and realizing cost savings; our ability to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses; pension plan costs; failure to comply with debt covenants or deterioration in our credit rating; our ability to maintain good labor relations; our ability to maintain brand image, reputation and product quality; lack of full-control over the operations of MillerCoors and other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference therein. All forward-looking statements in this press release are expressly qualified by such cautionary statements and by reference to the underlying assumptions. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  

 Use of Non-GAAP Measures  

 In addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), we also present pretax and after-tax "underlying income," "underlying effective tax rate," "underlying free cash flow," and "constant-currency," which are non-GAAP measures and should be viewed as supplements to (not substitutes for) our results of operations presented under U.S. GAAP. We also present underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("underlying EBITDA") as a non-GAAP measure. Our management uses underlying income, underlying EBITDA, underlying effective tax rate, underlying free cash flow and constant-currency as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance; as useful comparisons to the performance of our competitors; and as metrics of certain management incentive compensation calculations. We believe that underlying income, underlying EBITDA, underlying effective tax rate, underlying free cash flow and constant-currency performance are used by and are useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because they provide an additional tool to evaluate our performance without regard to special and non-core items, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and capital structure. We have provided reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures to their nearest U.S. GAAP measures and have consistently applied the adjustments within our reconciliations in arriving at each non-GAAP measure. These adjustments consist of special items from our U.S. GAAP financial statements as well as other non-core items, such as acquisition and integration related costs, unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses, and gains and losses on sales of non-operating assets, included in our U.S. GAAP results that warrant adjustment to arrive at non-GAAP results. We consider these items to be necessary adjustments for purposes of evaluating our ongoing business performance and are often considered non-recurring. Such adjustments are subjective and involve significant management judgment.

  (1)     The sum of the quarterly proportionate share of MillerCoors net income and share-based compensation adjustment amounts may not agree to the year-to-date amounts due to rounding.   

  (2)     Our net investment in MillerCoors is based on the carrying values of the net assets contributed to the joint venture, which is less than our proportionate share of underlying equity (42 percent) of MillerCoors (contributed by both Coors Brewing Company and Miller Brewing Company) by $657.0 million as of December 31, 2015. This basis difference, with the exception of certain non-amortizing items (goodwill, land, etc.), is being amortized as additional equity income over the remaining useful lives of the contributed long-lived amortizing assets.   

  (3)     The net adjustment is to eliminate all share-based compensation impacts related to pre-existing SABMiller plc equity awards held by former Miller Brewing Company employees now employed by MillerCoors, as well as to add back all share-based compensation impacts related to pre-existing MCBC equity awards held by former MCBC employees that have transferred to MillerCoors.

 Constant currency is a non-GAAP measure utilized by Molson Coors management to measure performance, excluding the impact of foreign currency movements. As we operate in various foreign countries where the local currency may strengthen or weaken significantly versus the U.S. dollar or other currencies used in operations, we utilize a constant currency measure as an additional metric to evaluate the underlying performance of each business without consideration of foreign currency movements. This information is non-GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to (not a substitute for) our reported results of operations under U.S. GAAP. We calculate the impact of foreign exchange on net sales, pretax income and non-GAAP underlying pretax income using the following steps:  

  1.     Multiply our current period local currency operating results (that also include the impact of the comparable prior-period currency hedging activities) by the weighted average foreign exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior year period. The result is the current-period operating results in U.S. dollars, as if foreign exchange rates had not changed from the prior-year period.   

  2.     Subtract the result in step 1 from the unadjusted current-period reported operating result in U.S. dollars (U.S. GAAP measure). This difference reflects the impact of foreign currency translational gains/losses included in the current-period results.   

  3.     Determine the amount of actual non-operating foreign currency gains/losses realized as a result of hedging activities and activities transacted in a currency other than the functional currency of each legal entity.   

  4.     Add the results of steps 2 and 3 above. This sum equals the total impact of foreign currency translational gains/losses and realized gains/losses from foreign currency transactions. This is the value shown in the “Foreign Exchange $ Impact” column within the table above.
