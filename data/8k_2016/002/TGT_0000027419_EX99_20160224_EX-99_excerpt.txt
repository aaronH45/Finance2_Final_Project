MINNEAPOLIS (Feb. 24, 2016) - Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) today announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results. The Company reported adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations1 (Adjusted EPS) of $1.52, an increase of 2.1 percent from $1.49 in 2014. Full-year Adjusted EPS of $4.69 was 11.3 percent higher than $4.22 in 2014. GAAP earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations were $2.31 in fourth quarter and $5.25 for full-year 2015, compared with $1.49 and $3.83 in 2014, respectively. Fourth quarter 2015 GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations include the gain on the sale of the pharmacy and clinic businesses and data breach and restructuring expenses that were excluded from Adjusted EPS. The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures for fourth quarter and full-year 2015. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS.

1Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the gain on the sale of the pharmacy and clinic businesses, restructuring charges, and the impact of certain matters not related to the Company’s single segment, such as discontinued operations, data breach expenses and certain other expenses that are discretely managed. See the “Discontinued Operations” and “Miscellaneous” sections of this release, as well as the tables of this release, for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.

“With traffic growing for five consecutive quarters and our signature categories of Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness leading our growth, Target’s results demonstrate that we are focused on the right strategic priorities,” said Brian Cornell, chairman and CEO of Target. “I want to thank our teams across the company for giving our guests a great holiday season, driving consistent growth throughout the fourth quarter and delivering on the sales and profit goals we laid out at the beginning of the year. While we have made a great deal of progress in 2015, we are excited about the opportunity in front of us to provide a more seamless experience and accelerate profitable growth.”

Fiscal 2016 Earnings Guidance

In first quarter 2016, Target expects both GAAP EPS from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS of $1.15 to $1.25, compared with first quarter 2015 GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $1.01 and Adjusted EPS of $1.10. For full-year 2016, Target expects GAAP EPS from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS of $5.20 to $5.40, compared with full-year 2015 GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $5.25 and Adjusted EPS of $4.69. First quarter and full-year 2016 GAAP EPS from continuing operations may include the impact of certain discrete items, which will be excluded in calculating Adjusted EPS. In the past, these items have included data breach expenses, restructuring costs, and certain other items that are discretely managed. The Company is not currently aware of any such discrete items.

Segment Results

Fourth quarter 2015 sales decreased 0.6 percent to $21.6 billion from $21.8 billion last year, as a 1.9 percent increase in comparable sales was more than offset by the impact of the sale of the pharmacy and clinic businesses in December to CVS Health. Digital channel sales grew 34 percent and contributed 1.3 percentage points to comparable sales growth. Segment earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) were $1,554 million in fourth quarter 2015, a decrease of 2.2 percent from $1,590 million in 2014. 

Fourth quarter EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were 9.8 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, compared with 9.8 percent and 7.3 percent in 2014. Fourth quarter gross margin rate was 27.9 percent, compared with 28.5 percent in 2014, as the benefit from a favorable merchandise mix was more than offset by investments in promotions. Fourth quarter SG&A

expense rate was 18.1 percent in 2015, compared with 18.6 percent in 2014, as investments in store labor were more than offset by continued expense discipline across the organization.

Interest Expense and Taxes from Continuing Operations

The Company’s fourth quarter 2015 net interest expense was $152 million, compared with $151 million last year. Fourth quarter 2015 effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 29.6 percent, compared with 33.0 percent last year, reflecting the impact of the gain on the sale of the pharmacy and clinic businesses.

Capital Returned to Shareholders

The Company returned $1,604 million to shareholders in fourth quarter 2015, representing 113 percent of net income from continuing operations.

•In the quarter, the Company paid dividends of $345 million, an increase of 4.4 percent from $330 million last year.

•The Company repurchased 17.3 million shares of common stock in the fourth quarter, at an average price of $72.70, for a total investment of $1,259 million. 

For 2015, the Company repurchased 44.7 million shares at an average price of $77.07, for a total investment of $3.4 billion. Under the current $10 billion share repurchase program through fourth quarter 2015, the Company has repurchased 94.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $69.57, for a total investment of approximately $6.6 billion.

For the trailing twelve months through fourth quarter 2015, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 16.0 percent, compared with 12.4 percent for the twelve months through fourth quarter 2014. Excluding the net gain and related tax impact of the sale of the pharmacy and clinic businesses, ROIC was 13.9 percent, reflecting higher profits on a stable base of invested capital. See the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this release for additional information about the Company’s ROIC calculation.

Discontinued Operations

Fourth quarter net earnings from discontinued operations were $5 million, compared with after-tax losses of ($3,600) million last year. Fourth quarter 2015 net earnings from discontinued operations primarily reflect tax benefits related to investment losses in Canada, whereas 2014

results included impairment losses and other charges related to the Company’s plans to discontinue operating stores in Canada.

Certain assets and liabilities of Target’s discontinued operations are based on estimates. The recorded assets include estimated receivables, and the remaining liabilities include accruals for estimated losses related to claims that may be asserted against Target Corporation, primarily under guarantees of certain leases. These estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, an assessment of the validity of certain claims and estimated payments by the Canada Subsidiaries. These estimates are subject to change, and the Company believes it is reasonably possible that adjustments to these amounts could be material to its results of operations in future periods. Any such adjustments would be recorded in discontinued operations.

Target will webcast its fourth quarter earnings conference call at 9:30 a.m. CST today. Investors and the media are invited to listen to the call at Target.com/Investors (hover over “company” then click on “events & presentations” in the “investors” column).

Miscellaneous

Statements in this release regarding first quarter and full year 2016 earnings per share guidance and future expenses related to discontinued operations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements speak only as of the date they are made and are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially. The most important risks and uncertainties are described in Item 1A of the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2015.

In addition to the GAAP results provided in this release, the Company provides Adjusted EPS for the three- and twelve-month periods ended Jan. 30, 2016, and Jan. 31, 2015. The Company also provides ROIC for the twelve-month periods ended Jan. 30, 2016, and Jan. 31, 2015, respectively, which is a ratio based on GAAP information, with the exception of

adjustments made to capitalize operating leases. Operating leases are capitalized as part of the ROIC calculation to control for differences in capital structure between the Company and its competitors. Adjusted EPS, capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Management believes Adjusted EPS is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of the Company’s ongoing retail operations. Management believes ROIC is useful in assessing the effectiveness of its capital allocation over time. The most comparable GAAP measure for adjusted diluted EPS is diluted EPS from continuing operations. The most comparable GAAP measure for capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest is total rent expense. Adjusted EPS, capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EPS and ROIC differently than the Company does, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

To provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS). This metric excludes the impact of the 2015 sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses, losses on early retirement of debt, net expenses related to the 2013 data breach and other matters presented below. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate non-GAAP adjusted EPS from continuing operations differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. Prior year amounts have been revised to present Adjusted EPS on a continuing operations basis.

Note: The sum of the non-GAAP adjustments may not equal the total adjustment amounts due to rounding.

(a) Represents the gain on the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses.

(b) Costs related to our previously announced corporate restructuring.

(c) Along with legal and other professional services, these expenses include adjustments to the accrual necessary to reflect our current loss expectations for the remaining claims related to the 2013 data breach. 

(d) For the twelve months ended January 30, 2016, these expenses relate to the impairment of long-lived and intangible assets. For the twelve months ended January 31, 2015, includes impairments of $16 million related to undeveloped land in the U.S. and $13 million of expense related to converting the co-branded REDcard program to MasterCard.

We have also disclosed after-tax return on invested capital for continuing operations (ROIC), which is a ratio based on GAAP information, with the exception of adjustments made to capitalize operating leases. Operating leases are capitalized as part of the ROIC calculation to control for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors. We believe this metric provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.
