 Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.  

On February 10, 2016, the board of directors (the “Board”) of Stericycle, Inc. (the “Company”) adopted an amendment and restatement of the Company’s bylaws (the “Amended and Restated Bylaws”). The Board implemented proxy access by adding Section 2.13, which permits a stockholder or group of up to 20 stockholders owning 3% or more of the Company’s common stock entitled to vote in the election of directors continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders, director candidates constituting up to the greater of two or 20% of the Board, provided that the stockholder (or group) and each nominee satisfy the requirements specified in the Amended and Restated Bylaws. The amendments also include clarifications and other conforming revisions to the annual meetings, advance notice, and special meetings provisions in Article 2.  

The Board also removed Section 3.10 from the Amended and Restated Bylaws, which had provided for the removal of directors for cause at special meetings of stockholders. The amendments are effective immediately.  

The foregoing description of the changes effected by the Amended and Restated Bylaws is qualified by reference to the Amended and Restated Bylaws, which are filed as Exhibit 3(ii).1 to this current report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
