On February 23, 2016, the Board of Directors of Apartment Investment and Management Company (“Aimco”) and the Board of Directors of AIMCO-GP, Inc., the general partner of AIMCO Properties, L.P. (“Aimco OP”) elected Nina A. Tran as a new director, effective March 1, 2016.

There are no arrangements or understandings between Ms. Tran and any other person pursuant to which she was elected as a director. Except for any independent director compensation to be awarded to Ms. Tran consistent with that provided to other independent directors, there have not been any transactions, nor are there any currently proposed transactions, to which Aimco or Aimco OP or any of its subsidiaries was or is to be a party in which Ms. Tran had, or will have, a direct or indirect material interest. The Board has determined that Ms. Tran meets the independence requirements set forth by the Board, including the categorical standards set forth in Section 303A.02 of the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. 

Ms. Tran has over 25 years of real estate and financial management experience, building and leading finance and accounting teams.

Prior to joining Starwood Waypoint, Ms. Tran spent 18 years at AMB Property Corporation (now Prologis, Inc.), the largest publicly traded global industrial REIT. Ms. Tran served as Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, and most recently as Chief Global Process Officer, where she helped lead the merger integration between AMB and Prologis.
