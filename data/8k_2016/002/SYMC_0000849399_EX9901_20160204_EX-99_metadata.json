        "Restructuring, separation, and transition: We have engaged in various restructuring, separation, and transition activities over the past several years that have resulted in costs associated with severance, facilities, transition, and other related costs. Separation and other related costs consist of consulting and disentanglement costs incurred to separate our security and information management businesses into standalone companies, as well as costs to prune selected product lines that do not fit either the Companyâ€™s growth or margin objectives. Transition and other related costs consist of consulting charges associated with the implementation of new Enterprise Resource Planning systems. Each restructuring, separation, and transition activity has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. We do not engage in restructuring, separation, or transition activities in the ordinary course of business. While our operations previously benefited from the employees and facilities covered by our various restructuring and separation charges, these employees and facilities have benefited different parts of our business in different ways, and the amount of these charges has varied significantly from period to period. We believe that it is important to understand these charges and we believe that investors benefit from excluding these charges from our operating results to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of current operating performance and comparisons to past operating performance."
