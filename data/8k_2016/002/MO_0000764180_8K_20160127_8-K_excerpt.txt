Item 2.05.Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.

On January 27, 2016, the Board of Directors of Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”) approved a productivity initiative designed to maintain Altria’s operating companies’ leadership and cost competitiveness. The initiative, which will reduce spending on certain selling, general and administrative infrastructure and implement a leaner organizational structure, is expected to deliver approximately $300 million in annualized productivity savings by the end of 2017. Altria estimates total pre-tax restructuring charges in connection with the initiative of approximately $140 million, or $0.05 per share, substantially all of which is expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2016. The estimated charges, substantially all of which will result in cash expenditures, relate primarily to employee separation costs of approximately $120 million and other associated costs of approximately $20 million. These estimated charges do not reflect the non-cash impact that may result from pension settlement and curtailment accounting.

Item 8.01.Other Events.

Filed as part of this Current Report on Form 8-K are the consolidated balance sheets of Altria and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 (the “Financial Statements”); report of management on internal control over financial reporting; the independent registered public accounting firm’s report on the Financial Statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and the statements regarding computation of ratios of earnings to fixed charges. The Financial Statements, report of management on internal control over financial reporting and the independent registered public accounting firm’s report on the Financial Statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting will also be filed as part of Altria’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
