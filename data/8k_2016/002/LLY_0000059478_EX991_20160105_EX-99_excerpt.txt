•The company now expects 2015 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.28 to $2.33 on a reported basis. Expected 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share have been reaffirmed at $3.40 to $3.45. 

INDIANAPOLIS, IN - Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced its 2016 financial guidance and highlighted key events for the upcoming year. The company also reaffirmed its commitment to grow revenue and expand margins through the balance of the decade, while sustaining a flow of innovative medicines and deploying capital to create shareholder value. 

“We’ve stayed true to our commitment to innovation, and it’s paying off for patients and shareholders. Lilly continues to deliver on our financial commitments while advancing our pipeline and launching new medicines,” said John C. Lechleiter, Ph.D., Lilly’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. 

Lechleiter added, “We enter 2016 in a position of strength anticipating continued growth. Our goal is to sustain the flow of valuable medicines from our pipeline to improve patients’ lives and create value for shareholders.”

“In 2016 we expect multiple regulatory actions across therapeutic areas including diabetes, oncology and immunology,” said Derica Rice, Lilly’s executive vice president for global services and chief financial officer. 

“This will be another important year for execution of our innovation-based strategy, which will solidify our near- to medium-term growth prospects.” 

Lilly also said 2015 earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $2.28 to $2.33 on a reported basis. Prior reported expectations were $2.40 to $2.45. This revision is due to fourth-quarter after-tax charges of approximately $0.12 per share associated primarily with the previously announced acquisition of worldwide rights to an intranasal glucagon from Locemia Solutions. Expected 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share, which will exclude these charges, have been reaffirmed at $3.40 to $3.45. For a further reconciliation of reported to non-GAAP earnings per share expectations for 2015, see the company’s Form 8-K dated October 22, 2015. Fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 financial results will be announced on January 28, 2016.
