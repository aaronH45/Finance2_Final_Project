[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note: A detailed reconciliation of the reported financial information to the adjusted financial information is included at the end of this news release.

CEO Comments

Denise Morrison, Campbell’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We’re pleased with our results this quarter, especially our strong profit performance across all three segments. The highlight of the quarter was our continued gross margin expansion, which reflects improvements in productivity, net price realization and improved supply chain execution. Our three-year cost savings 

program is also performing better than anticipated, and we have raised our 2018 target to $300 million.

“Organic sales for the quarter were comparable to prior year, a bit below our expectation. While our Global Biscuits and Snacks division stands out for delivering both organic sales growth and strong profit growth in the quarter, we’re making investments in all the divisions toward our objective of accelerating sales growth over time. 

“Over the last 12 months, we’ve implemented significant changes to the company, including aligning our enterprise structure with our strategy, creating clear portfolio roles for our divisions and undertaking our major cost savings initiative. I feel very good about the progress we’ve made, however, we are aware that we have more work to do. We’re now better positioned to execute our strategies and to invest in the areas of our business that hold the greatest potential.”

Second-Quarter Results 

Sales decreased 1 percent to $2.201 billion driven by lower volume and the adverse impact of currency translation, partly offset by higher selling prices, the benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet and lower promotional spending. Organic sales were comparable to the prior year with gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks offset by declines in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages. 

Gross margin increased from 33.3 percent to 37.2 percent. Excluding items impacting comparability in the current year, adjusted gross margin improved 4 percentage points. The increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily driven by productivity improvements, higher selling prices, lower promotional spending and improved supply chain performance. 

Marketing and selling expenses decreased 7 percent to $223 million. Excluding items impacting comparability in the current year, adjusted marketing and selling expenses decreased 5 percent to $226 million primarily due to the benefits from cost savings initiatives, partly offset by higher advertising and consumer promotion expenses. Administrative expenses increased 8 percent to $146 million. Excluding items impacting comparability in the current year, adjusted administrative expenses increased 6 percent to $143 million primarily due to higher incentive

compensation costs compared to the prior year, partly offset by the benefits from cost savings initiatives. 

EBIT increased 23 percent to $414 million. Excluding items impacting comparability in the current year, adjusted EBIT increased 26 percent to $423 million reflecting a higher adjusted gross margin percentage and the benefits from cost savings initiatives, partly offset by higher incentive compensation costs, the adverse impact of currency translation and volume declines. 

Net interest expense increased $2 million to $27 million reflecting higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio. The tax rate increased 2.7 percentage points to 31.5 percent. Excluding items impacting comparability in the current year, the adjusted tax rate increased 2.8 percentage points to 31.6 percent primarily due to lapping the favorable resolution of an intercompany pricing agreement between the U.S. and Canada in the prior year.

First-Half Results 

Sales decreased 2 percent to $4.404 billion driven by the adverse impact of currency translation and lower volume, partly offset by higher selling prices, the benefit from the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet and lower promotional spending. Organic sales were comparable to the prior year with gains in Global Biscuits and Snacks offset by declines in Americas Simple Meals and Beverages and Campbell Fresh. 

EBIT of $729 million was comparable to the prior year. The first-half results were negatively impacted by mark-to-market losses associated with the interim remeasurement of certain U.S. pension plans as well as charges incurred related to cost savings initiatives. Excluding items impacting comparability in the current year, adjusted EBIT increased 24 percent to $902 million reflecting a higher adjusted gross margin percentage, the benefits from cost savings initiatives and lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses, partly offset by the adverse impact of currency translation, higher incentive compensation costs and volume declines. 

Net interest expense increased $5 million to $55 million reflecting higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio. The tax rate increased 1.4 percentage points to 31.9 percent. Excluding items impacting comparability in the current year, the adjusted tax rate increased 2.4 percentage points to 32.9 percent.

3

Cash flow from operations increased to $727 million from $584 million a year ago, primarily due to higher cash earnings and lower working capital requirements.

Fiscal 2016 Guidance 

As previously announced and shown in the table below, Campbell expects a year-over-year change of -1 to 0 percent in sales; +10 to +13 percent in adjusted EBIT; and +9 to +12 percent in adjusted EPS, or $2.88 to $2.96 per share. This guidance includes an estimated 2 percentage-point negative impact from currency translation, as well as the impact of the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Second Quarter Ended January 31, 2016

Campbell Soup Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in certain communications. These non-GAAP financial measures are measures of performance not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, GAAP reported measures.

Organic Net Sales

The company believes that organic net sales, which exclude the impact of currency and acquisitions, improves the comparability of year-to-year results. A reconciliation of net sales as reported to organic net sales follows.

Items Impacting Gross Margin and Earnings

The company believes that financial information excluding certain items that are not considered to be part of the ongoing business improves the comparability of year-to-year results. Consequently, the company believes that investors may be able to better understand its gross margin and earnings results excluding these transactions.

The following items impacted gross margin and/or earnings:

(1)In fiscal 2016, the company changed the method of accounting for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans and the calculation of expected return on pension plan assets. Historically, actuarial gains and losses associated with benefit obligations were recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were amortized into earnings over the remaining service life of participants to the extent that the amounts were in excess of a corridor. Under the new policy, actuarial gains and losses will be recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as of the measurement date, which is typically the end of the fiscal year, or more frequently if an interim remeasurement is required. In addition, the company will no longer use a market-related value of plan assets, which is an average value, to determine the expected return on assets but rather will use the fair value of plan assets. The company excludes the impact of the 

15

mark-to-market adjustments resulting from these accounting changes in evaluating performance. These changes in accounting policy have been retrospectively applied to all periods presented. In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the company incurred a pre-tax gain of $7 million in Costs and expenses ($4 million after tax, or $.01 per share) due to mark-to-market adjustments. Year-to-date, the company incurred pre-tax charges of $121 million in Costs and expenses ($76 million after tax, or $.24 per share) due to mark-to-market adjustments. For the year ended August 2, 2015, the company incurred pre-tax charges of $138 million in Costs and expenses ($87 million after tax, or $.28 per share) due to mark-to-market adjustments.

(2)In fiscal 2015, the company implemented a new enterprise design and initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline its organizational structure. In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $12 million related to these initiatives. The company also incurred pre-tax charges of $7 million recorded in Administrative expenses related to these initiatives. In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the company also recorded a reduction to pre-tax restructuring charges of $3 million related to the fiscal 2014 initiative to improve supply chain efficiency in Australia. The aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs was $10 million, or $.03 per share. Year-to-date, the company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $33 million related to the fiscal 2015 initiatives. The company also incurred pre-tax charges of $22 million recorded in Administrative expenses related to these initiatives. The company also recorded a reduction to pre-tax restructuring charges of $3 million related to the fiscal 2014 initiative to improve supply chain efficiency in Australia. The aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs was $33 million, or $.11 per share. For the year ended August 2, 2015, the company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $102 million related to the fiscal 2015 initiatives. The company also incurred pre-tax charges of $22 million recorded in Administrative expenses related to these initiatives.
