PFIZER REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2015 RESULTS

PROVIDES 2016 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

▪Provides 2016 Financial Guidance

NEW YORK, N.Y., Tuesday, February 2, 2016 – Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) reported financial results for fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 and provided 2016 financial guidance.

On September 3, 2015, Pfizer acquired Hospira, Inc. (Hospira). Consequently, and in accordance with Pfizer's domestic and international reporting periods(3), full-year financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflect four months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and three months of legacy Hospira international operations, while financial results from fourth-quarter 2014 and full-year 2014 do not include any contribution from legacy Hospira operations. Fourth-quarter 2015 includes three months of legacy Hospira global operations.

The Company manages its commercial operations through two distinct businesses: an Innovative Products business and an Established Products business. The Innovative Products business is composed of two operating segments: the Global Innovative Pharmaceutical segment (GIP)(4) and the Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare segment (VOC)(4). The Established Products business consists of the Global Established Pharmaceutical segment (GEP)(4), which includes all legacy Hospira commercial operations. Financial results for each of these segments are presented in the Operating Segment Information section.

Some amounts in this press release may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts. Results for fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 and 2014 are summarized below.

EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY

Ian Read, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “The just completed year was very productive in terms of business momentum, pipeline advancement and business development activity. I am particularly pleased with the performance of our Prevnar 13 adult and Ibrance launches in the U.S. In addition, Eliquis, Xeljanz and the Hospira portfolio, among other assets, along with operational growth in emerging markets, meaningfully enhanced the strength of our businesses.

“I believe that we are well positioned to deliver another strong year in 2016 as we expect that our key in-line products will continue to perform well while we expect to advance our product pipeline, notably our potential registrational programs in key therapeutic areas such as oncology, vaccines, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, inflammation and rare diseases.”

Mr. Read continued, “The integration of Hospira is well underway and we now look forward to completing the combination with Allergan, which we still expect to occur during the second half of this year. We see this transaction as a very effective driver of accelerating the growth potential of our Innovative business, strengthening our Established business and more efficiently allocating our capital globally, all factors which remain consistent with our overarching strategy of value creation.

“I want to thank our colleagues for their continued tireless work in an environment, that while challenging, continues to be very rewarding for our stakeholders,” Mr. Read concluded.

Frank D’Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, “2015 was a truly transformational year for Pfizer. In addition to our strong financial performance, we completed the Hospira acquisition, announced the pending combination with Allergan and continued to deliver shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. Regarding our financial performance, we exceeded our 2015 financial guidance for reported revenue(1) and met the top end of our 2015 financial guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS(2) despite an operating environment that remains challenging. Importantly, Pfizer-standalone revenues increased 3% operationally, marking Pfizer's first year of 

- 3 -

operational revenue growth since entering a period of significant product losses of exclusivity. We believe the completion of the Hospira acquisition and the pending Allergan combination will strengthen our core businesses and better position the Company for sustainable revenue growth in the future.

“Today we are also providing our 2016 financial guidance, including ranges for reported revenues(1) of $49.0 to $51.0 billion and for adjusted diluted EPS(2) of $2.20 to $2.30. Our guidance for reported revenues(1) reflects anticipated mid-to-high-single digit operational revenue growth on an enterprise basis offset by the anticipated negative impact of $2.3 billion due to generic competition for products that recently lost or are expected to soon lose marketing exclusivity as well as $2.3 billion as a result of adverse changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared to foreign exchange rates from last year, including $0.8 billion due to the estimated significant currency impact related to Venezuela. Our 2016 financial guidance excludes any impact from the pending combination with Allergan. Finally, our guidance for reported(1) and adjusted(2) diluted EPS also reflects anticipated share repurchases totaling $5 billion this year, consisting of our previously-announced plans to enter into a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement that we expect to execute in the first half of 2016. These planned repurchases are expected to more than offset the potential dilution related to employee compensation programs,” Mr. D'Amelio concluded.

QUARTERLY FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Fourth-Quarter 2015 vs. Fourth-Quarter 2014) 

Reported revenues(1) totaled $14.0 billion, an increase of $930 million, or 7%, which reflects operational growth of $1.9 billion, or 14%, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $934 million, or 7%. Excluding the impact of legacy Hospira operations of $1.2 billion, foreign exchange and, to a lesser extent, the vaccines acquired from Baxter International Inc. (Baxter) of $35 million, Pfizer-standalone revenues increased by $646 million operationally, or 5%.

Operational revenue growth in developed markets was driven primarily by the inclusion of $1.1 billion of revenues from legacy Hospira operations and continued strong performance of several key products, notably Prevnar 13 in adults and Ibrance in the U.S., Eliquis globally as well as Xeljanz and Lyrica primarily in the U.S. In emerging markets, revenues increased 5% operationally, favorably impacted by the addition of legacy Hospira operations, which contributed $73 million, as well as the performance of Prevenar 13 and certain other products.

Operational revenue growth was partially offset primarily by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. and certain other developed markets, Lyrica in certain developed Europe markets and Zyvox in the U.S.

FULL-YEAR FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Full-Year 2015 vs. Full-Year 2014) 

Reported revenues(1) decreased $754 million, or 2%, which reflects operational growth of $3.0 billion, or 6%, more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $3.8 billion, or 8%. Excluding the impact of legacy Hospira operations of $1.5 billion, foreign exchange and, to a lesser extent, the vaccines acquired from Baxter of $178 million, Pfizer-standalone revenues increased by $1.3 billion operationally, or 3%, which reflects operational revenue growth from certain key products partially offset by product losses of exclusivity and co-promotion expirations that negatively impacted 2015 reported revenues(1) by $3.2 billion operationally.

Income Statement Highlights[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

–higher adjusted cost of sales(2), primarily reflecting an increase in sales volume, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies and a decrease in royalty expense associated with products that recently lost marketing exclusivity;

–higher adjusted SI&A expense(2), primarily reflecting increased investments to support recently launched products, other in-line biopharmaceutical products and certain Consumer Healthcare brands, partially offset by lower expenses associated with certain products that have recently lost marketing exclusivity, continued benefits from cost-reduction and productivity initiatives as well as a lower cost for the Branded Prescription Drug Fee compared to the prior year; and[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

▪The diluted weighted-average shares outstanding declined by 167 million shares compared to the prior-year, primarily due to Pfizer’s share repurchase program, including the impact of the $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February 2015 and completed in July 2015.

▪In addition to the aforementioned full-year 2015 factors and the factors impacting fourth-quarter 2015 reported earnings, full-year 2015 reported earnings were primarily impacted by the following:

- 7 -

Unfavorable impacts:

–higher acquisition-related costs, purchase accounting adjustments and restructuring charges, all primarily associated with the acquisition of Hospira in third-quarter 2015;

–higher asset impairment charges, including an impairment loss related to Pfizer's 49%-owned equity-method investment with Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (Hisun) in China recorded in third-quarter 2015; and

–higher charges incurred during 2015 for business and legal entity alignment activities.

Favorable impacts:

–lower legal charges, primarily as a result of the non-recurrence of the aforementioned charge to resolve a securities class action recorded in fourth-quarter 2014 and the non-recurrence of a charge to resolve Neurontin-related matters recorded in first-quarter 2014;

–lower implementation costs associated with restructuring activities and amortization expense related to intangible assets; 

–the non-recurrence of a charge incurred in third-quarter 2014 for an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee in accordance with final regulations issued in third-quarter 2014 by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service; and

–a lower effective tax rate, primarily due to the aforementioned factors impacting the fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 effective tax rate as well as the non-recurrence in 2015 of the non-tax deductible charge for the aforementioned additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee incurred in third-quarter 2014.

RECENT NOTABLE DEVELOPMENTS

Product Developments

▪Eliquis (apixaban)

–Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) and Pfizer announced in December 2015 results from a post-hoc early time course subanalysis of the Phase 3 AMPLIFY (Apixaban for the Initial Management of Pulmonary Embolism and Deep Vein Thrombosis as First-Line Therapy) trial. The subanalysis demonstrated Eliquis was comparable to conventional therapy (subcutaneous enoxaparin overlapped and followed by oral warfarin dose-adjusted to an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0) in recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and VTE-related death with significantly less major 

- 8 -

bleeding during the first 7, 21 and 90 days after starting treatment. The results of the subanalyses at each pre-specified time interval were consistent with the overall results of the AMPLIFY trial at six months.

–In November 2015, BMS and Pfizer presented 22 abstracts at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2015. The new data, including four oral presentations, contribute to the BMS and Pfizer Alliance’s research in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and VTE in patients treated with Eliquis. Abstracts included new data analyses from the pivotal Phase 3 study, ARISTOTLE, as well as a number of real-world data analyses.

▪Ibrance (palbociclib) -- Pfizer announced in December 2015 that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for filing and granted Priority Review for a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Ibrance. If approved, the sNDA would expand the approved use of Ibrance to reflect findings from the Phase 3 PALOMA-3 trial, which evaluated Ibrance in combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant plus placebo in women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer, regardless of menopausal status, whose disease progressed after endocrine therapy, including those with and without prior treatment for their metastatic disease. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA is April 2016.

▪Lyrica (pregabalin) -- Pfizer announced in November 2015 top-line results of a Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Lyrica Capsules CV in adults with chronic post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain. The study did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint. The study was conducted as a 15-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study with a primary objective to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin in the treatment of chronic post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean pain reduction from baseline compared with placebo based on pain scores from patients’ daily pain diaries. The safety profile observed in this study was consistent with that known for pregabalin. The most common adverse events with pregabalin in this study were dizziness, somnolence, nausea and fatigue. There is currently no treatment approved by the FDA for post-traumatic neuropathic pain.

▪Xalkori (crizotinib)

–In December 2015, the FDA accepted and granted Priority Review for a sNDA for Xalkori for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are ROS1-positive. In April 2015, Xalkori received Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for this potential indication. If approved, Xalkori would be the first FDA-approved biomarker-driven therapy for the treatment of ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC. Xalkori is currently indicated in the U.S. for patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive as detected by an FDA-approved test. The PDUFA goal date for a decision by the FDA is April 2016.

- 9 -

–Pfizer announced in November 2015 that the European Commission (EC) approved a label update to expand use of Xalkori to first-line treatment of adults with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. The Summary of Product Characteristics also has been updated to include efficacy data from PROFILE 1014, which demonstrated that Xalkori significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in previously untreated patients with ALK-positive advanced nonsquamous NSCLC when compared to standard platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. 

–In November 2015, Pfizer announced that PROFILE 1029, a Phase 3 study of Xalkori met its primary objective of significantly prolonging PFS in previously untreated East Asian patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC when compared to a standard chemotherapy doublet. In this study, Xalkori was used as the first systemic therapy for patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, and patients could have received therapy and/or surgery for early stage disease before they were diagnosed with metastatic disease. The adverse events observed with Xalkori in the study were generally consistent with findings from previous trials. No unexpected adverse events were observed. Efficacy and safety data from PROFILE 1029 will be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting.

▪Xeljanz (tofacitinib citrate) -- Pfizer presented in November 2015 26 new scientific abstracts, including 20 presentations for Xeljanz in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at the American College of Rheumatology/Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals Annual Meeting. The new data continue to characterize the safety and efficacy of Xeljanz in the treatment of RA.

Pipeline Developments

A comprehensive update of Pfizer’s development pipeline was published today and is now available at www.pfizer.com/pipeline. It includes an overview of Pfizer’s research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication and phase of development, as well as mechanism of action for candidates from Phase 2 through registration.

▪ALO-02 (oxycodone hydrochloride and naltrexone hydrochloride) -- The FDA has not taken action on Pfizer’s New Drug Application (NDA) for ALO-02, which had a PDUFA date in January 2016. The delay is not related to anything specific in the ALO-02 NDA, and no additional data analyses or data requests have been identified by the FDA. Pfizer is continuing discussions with the FDA to finalize the label. Pfizer cannot speculate on timing for the FDA decision.

▪Avelumab(7) (MSB0010718C)

–Merck KGaA and Pfizer announced during fourth-quarter 2015 the initiation of five Phase 3 trials of avelumab(7), an investigational fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, in various cancers, including:

- 10 -

•JAVELIN Lung 100 is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of avelumab(7), compared with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, in patients with late-stage NSCLC who have not previously received any treatment for their systemic lung cancer.

•JAVELIN Gastric 100 is designed to compare the switch from first-line chemotherapy to maintenance therapy with avelumab(7) versus continuation of chemotherapy in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic gastric/gastro-esophageal junction cancers whose disease has not progressed with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

•JAVELIN Gastric 300 is designed to evaluate the superiority (based on overall survival) of avelumab(7) in patients with unresectable, recurrent or metastatic gastric/gastro-esophageal junction cancers, compared with investigator’s choice of chemotherapy from a pre-specified list of therapeutic options.

•JAVELIN Ovarian 200 is designed to evaluate the superiority of avelumab(7) as a monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), compared with PLD alone, in treating patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. The JAVELIN Ovarian 200 trial is the first Phase 3 study of a PD-L1 inhibitor investigated in this setting.

•JAVELIN Bladder 100 is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of avelumab(7) plus best supportive care (BSC) as a maintenance treatment, compared with BSC alone, in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer whose disease did not progress on (or following) completion of first-line treatment with a platinum-containing chemotherapy.

–Merck KGaA and Pfizer announced in November 2015 that the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products issued a positive opinion for Orphan Drug designation for avelumab(7) for the treatment of patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer. An official decision by the EC was granted in December 2015.

–Merck KGaA and Pfizer announced in November 2015 that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for avelumab(7) for the treatment of patients with metastatic MCC who have progressed after at least one previous chemotherapy regimen. 

–Merck KGaA and Pfizer announced in October 2015 that the FDA granted avelumab(7) Fast Track designation for the treatment of metastatic MCC. 

▪Bococizumab (PF-04950615, RN316) -- In January 2016, Pfizer received positive top-line results from the first of six Phase 3 studies evaluating the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction activity of bococizumab. The SPIRE-SI study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of bococizumab in adults with dyslipidemia who are intolerant to statins. A total of 184 patients were 

- 11 -

randomized to receive either 150 mg of bococizumab every two weeks by subcutaneous injection, atorvastatin 40 mg once-daily or placebo once-daily for 12 weeks. The trial met its primary endpoint, as measured by the percent change in baseline LDL-C level at 12 weeks. No new or unexpected safety findings for bococizumab were observed in the study. Complete study results of the SPIRE-SI trial will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress. Results from other Phase 3 studies evaluating LDL-C reduction are expected throughout 2016.

Corporate Developments

▪BMS and Pfizer announced in February 2016 that the companies have entered into a collaboration agreement with Portola Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Portola) to develop and commercialize the investigational agent andexanet alfa in Japan. Andexanet alfa, which is in Phase 3 clinical development in the U.S. and Europe, is designed to reverse the anticoagulant activity of Factor Xa inhibitors, including Eliquis.

▪Pfizer announced in January 2016 an expansion of its R&D investment strategy to include early-stage companies on the leading edge of scientific innovation, providing them with both equity and access to resources for research in promising areas aligned with Pfizer’s core interests. The first four investments of the newly focused initiative include $46 million in financing to companies at early stages of the discovery process that are actively exploring Conditionally Active Biologics, immuno-oncology, neurodegenerative technologies and gene therapy. Additional opportunities will continue to be identified by Pfizer’s scientific leadership through their active involvement, and Pfizer will help recipient companies fully explore their platforms in the hopes of advancing new therapeutic pathways.

▪Pfizer and Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation (Adaptive) announced in January 2016 that they have entered into a translational research collaboration to leverage next generation sequencing of the adaptive immune system to advance Pfizer’s growing immuno-oncology franchise. Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer and Adaptive will seek to combine drug development and platform technology biomarker expertise to identify patients who may preferentially benefit from immunotherapy.

▪Merck KGaA, Pfizer and Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Syndax) announced in January 2016 that they have entered into a collaboration agreement to evaluate avelumab(7) in combination with Syndax’s entinostat, an investigational oral small molecule that targets immune regulatory cells (myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T-cells), in patients with heavily pre-treated, recurrent ovarian cancer. This is an exclusive agreement between the Merck KGaA-Pfizer alliance and Syndax to study the combination of these two investigational agents in ovarian cancer. Syndax will be responsible for conducting the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial.

▪In December 2015, Pfizer announced that its Board of Directors declared a 30-cent first-quarter 2016 dividend on the Company’s common stock, payable March 2, 2016, to shareholders of record at the close 

- 12 -

of business on February 5, 2016. This represents an increase of 7% in the quarterly dividend per share, compared to 28 cents per share in first-quarter 2015.

▪In December 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a new $11 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time. In November 2015, Pfizer announced that, consistent with 2015, it expects to execute an approximately $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. As of December 31, 2015, Pfizer had $16.4 billion in aggregate remaining under its share repurchase authorizations.

▪In November 2015, Pfizer announced that it entered into a definitive merger agreement with Allergan, a global pharmaceutical company incorporated in Ireland, under which Pfizer agreed to combine with Allergan in a stock transaction valued at $363.63 per Allergan share, for a total enterprise value of approximately $160 billion, based on the closing price of Pfizer common stock of $32.18 on November 20, 2015 (the last trading day prior to the announcement). Allergan shareholders will receive 11.3 shares of the combined company for each of their Allergan shares by virtue of a share split, and Pfizer stockholders will have the option of receiving one share of the combined company for some or all of their Pfizer shares or to receive cash instead of shares of the combined company for some or all of their Pfizer shares, provided that the aggregate amount of cash to be paid in the merger will not be less than $6 billion or greater than $12 billion. In the event that elections to receive cash and shares in the merger would otherwise result in an aggregate of less than $6 billion or greater than $12 billion of cash being paid out in the merger, then the share elections and cash elections will be subject to proration. The completion of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of 2016, is subject to certain conditions, including receipt of regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S. and EU, the receipt of necessary approvals from both Pfizer and Allergan shareholders, and the completion of Allergan’s pending divestiture of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. The merger agreement also provides that the businesses of Pfizer and Allergan will be combined under the existing Allergan entity, which, subject to approval by Allergan shareholders, will be renamed “Pfizer plc.”

▪In response to the ongoing challenges patients face in paying their out-of-pocket costs for their prescription medicines, Pfizer announced in November 2015 that it has doubled the allowable income level for its patient assistance program, so that even more patients in need could be eligible to receive their Pfizer medicines for free. With this change, more than 40 medicines offered for free through the program are now available to eligible patients earning up to four times the Federal Poverty Level adjusted for family size ($47,080 for a single person; $97,000 for a family of four). Through the Pfizer RxPathways program, Pfizer offers patients, including those with health insurance and those without, a range of individual services to help them gain access to Pfizer medicines. From 2010 to 2014, Pfizer has helped nearly 2.5 million uninsured and underinsured patients get access to more than 30 million Pfizer prescriptions, making it the most comprehensive program of its kind.

longer expected to be settled at the Venezuelan government CENCOEX official rate of 6.30, but rather at the SIMADI official rate of 200, the lowest official rate. Those conditions included the inability to obtain significant conversions of Venezuelan bolivars related to intercompany U.S. dollar denominated accounts, an evaluation of the effects of the implementation of a fourth quarter 2015 operational restructuring, resulting in a 36% reduction in our labor force in Venezuela, and our expectation of the changes in Venezuela’s responses to changes in its economy.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Provision for taxes on income for fourth-quarter and full-year 2014 was favorably impacted by the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business, and the extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit which was signed into law in December 2014. The Provision for taxes on income for full-year 2014 was also favorably impacted by a decline in the non-tax deductible loss recorded in 2013 related to an option to acquire the remaining interest in Teuto since we expect to retain the investment indefinitely, the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. The Provision for taxes on income for full-year 2014 was unfavorably impacted by a non-tax deductible charge to account for an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee in accordance with final regulations issued by the IRS in the third quarter of 2014.

(a)Restructuring charges include employee termination costs, asset impairments and other exit costs associated with business combinations. Transaction costs represent external costs directly related to the pending combination with Allergan plc (Allergan) and the acquisition of Hospira, and primarily include expenditures for banking, legal, accounting and other similar services. Integration costs represent external, incremental costs directly related to integrating acquired businesses, and primarily include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes. In fourth-quarter and full-year 2015, restructuring charges and integration costs primarily relate to our acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015. All of these costs and charges are included in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(c)In fourth-quarter and full-year 2015, represents (i) an $806 million foreign currency loss included in Other (income)/deductions––net related to recent conditions in Venezuela, that had us resolve that our Venezuelan bolivar-denominated monetary assets that are subject to revaluation are no longer expected to be settled at the Venezuelan government CENCOEX official rate of 6.30, but rather at the SIMADI official rate of 200, the lowest official rate. Those conditions included the inability to obtain significant conversions of Venezuelan bolivars related to intercompany U.S. dollar denominated accounts, an evaluation of the effects of the implementation of a fourth quarter 2015 operational restructuring, resulting in a 36% reduction in our labor force in Venezuela, and our expectation of the changes in Venezuela’s responses to changes in its economy; and (ii) a $72 million charge included in Cost of sales related to inventory impairment in Venezuela related to the foreign currency change described above.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(5)Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are Non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.

(6)Exclusive of amortization of intangible assets, except as discussed in footnote (7) below.

(d)Corporate––the costs associated with Corporate, representing platform functions (such as worldwide technology, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement) and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments.

(e)Other Unallocated––other unallocated costs, representing overhead expenses associated with our manufacturing and commercial operations not directly attributable to an operating segment.

For information purposes only, for full-year 2015, we estimate that Other costs, in the aggregate and as described above, but excluding (i) the revenues and costs associated with PCS; (ii) net interest-related expense not attributable to an operating segment included in Corporate (approximately $831 million for full-year 2015 in Other (income)/deductions––net); and (iii) net gains on investments not attributable to an operating segment and included in Corporate (approximately $104 million for full-year 2015 in Other (income)/deductions––net), are generally associated with our operating segments, as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Amounts not material. After excluding net interest expense included in Corporate and net gains on investments not attributable to an operating segment and included in Corporate, Other (income)/deductions––net approximates $97 million of expense for full-year 2015.

The percentages provided in the table above do not purport to reflect additional amounts that each of our operating segments would have incurred had each segment operated as a standalone company during the periods presented. 

•WRD/Medical––The information provided in the tables above for WRD and Medical was substantially all derived from our estimates of the costs incurred in connection with the R&D projects associated with each operating segment. 

•Corporate/Other Unallocated––Virtually all of the information provided in the tables above for Corporate and Other Unallocated was derived using proportional allocation methods based on global, regional or country revenues or global, regional or country headcount, as well as certain cost metrics, as appropriate, such as those derived from research and development and manufacturing costs. Management believes that the allocations of Corporate and Other Unallocated costs are reasonable.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

DISCLOSURE NOTICE: The information contained in this earnings release and the attachments is as of February 2, 2016. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements contained in this earnings release and the attachments as a result of new information or future events or developments.

This earnings release and the attachments contain forward-looking statements about our anticipated future operating and financial performance, business plans and prospects, in-line products and product candidates, strategic reviews, capital allocation, business-development plans, the benefits expected from our recent acquisition of Hospira, the pending combination with Allergan and plans relating to share repurchases and dividends, among other things, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements by the fact that they use future dates or use words such as “will,” “may,” “could,” “likely,” “ongoing,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “target,” “forecast,” “goal,” “objective,” “aim” and other words and terms of similar meaning. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past results and future plans and projected future results are the following:

▪the outcome of research and development activities, including, without limitation, the ability to meet anticipated pre-clinical and clinical trial commencement and completion dates, regulatory submission and approval dates, and launch dates for product candidates, as well as the possibility of unfavorable clinical trial results, including unfavorable new clinical data and additional analyses of existing clinical data;

▪decisions by regulatory authorities regarding whether and when to approve our drug applications, which will depend on the assessment by such regulatory authorities of the benefit-risk profile suggested by the totality of the efficacy and safety information submitted; decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling, ingredients and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of our products; and uncertainties regarding our ability to address the comments in complete response letters received by us with respect to certain of our drug applications to the satisfaction of the FDA;

▪the speed with which regulatory authorizations, pricing approvals and product launches may be achieved;

▪the outcome of post-approval clinical trials, which could result in the loss of marketing approval for a product or changes in the labeling for, and/or increased or new concerns about the safety or efficacy of, a product that could affect its availability or commercial potential;

▪risks associated with interim data, including the risk that final results of studies for which interim data have been provided and/or additional clinical trials may be different from (including less favorable than) the interim data results and may not support further clinical development of the applicable product candidate or indication;

▪the success of external business-development activities, including the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions in the anticipated timeframe or at all;

▪competitive developments, including the impact on our competitive position of new product entrants, in-line branded products, generic products, private label products and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line drugs and drug candidates;

▪the implementation by the FDA and regulatory authorities in certain other countries of an abbreviated legal pathway to approve biosimilar products, which could subject our biologic products to competition from biosimilar products, with attendant competitive pressures, after the expiration of any applicable exclusivity period and patent rights;

▪the ability to meet generic and branded competition after the loss of patent protection for our products or competitor products;

▪the ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally;

▪difficulties or delays in manufacturing;

▪trade buying patterns;

▪the impact of existing and future legislation and regulatory provisions on product exclusivity;

The operating segment information provided in this earnings release and the attachments does not purport to represent the revenues, costs and income from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income that each of our operating segments would have recorded had each segment operated as a standalone company during the periods presented.

This earnings release may include discussion of certain clinical studies relating to various in-line products and/or product candidates. These studies typically are part of a larger body of clinical data relating to such products or product candidates, and the discussion herein should be considered in the context of the larger body of data. In addition, clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations, and, even when we view data as sufficient to support the safety and/or effectiveness of a product candidate or a new indication for an in-line product, regulatory authorities may not share our views and may require additional data or may deny approval altogether.
