MINNEAPOLIS — January 27, 2016 — Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported fourth quarter 2015 net income(1) of $357 million, or $2.00 per diluted share. Operating earnings were $441 million, with operating earnings per diluted share increasing to $2.47, up 7 percent. 

Operating net revenues were flat at $3.0 billion reflecting flat and volatile equity markets and continued low interest rates, which were offset by asset management performance fees. 

Operating expenses were $2.4 billion, up 1 percent from a year ago. General and administrative expenses increased 4 percent primarily associated with performance fees and collateralized loan obligation (CLO) liquidation benefits — these items accounted for 3 percent of the 4 percent increase. Overall, expenses remain well controlled. 

On a full-year basis, the company generated strong operating results during a period of heightened volatility and continued low interest rates. Compared to 2014, operating net revenues grew 1 percent to $11.7 billion, operating earnings grew 3 percent to $1.7 billion and operating earnings per diluted share increased 9 percent to $9.32. 

In the quarter, the company continued to deliver a strong return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends of $569 million. For the full year, the company returned over $2.1 billion to shareholders, representing 125 percent of operating earnings. 

“While the global economic and market environment continued to present headwinds, Ameriprise delivered a solid fourth quarter,” said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. “Increased volatility and investor concerns reinforce the importance of the advice and solutions Ameriprise provides to our clients.” 

“Our diversified business and financial foundation provide the strength and flexibility to serve our clients, invest through market cycles and return capital to shareholders. In fact, for the fifth consecutive year we returned more than 100 percent of our operating earnings to shareholders. And we delivered a record high operating return on equity of 24.3 percent.”

 Advice & Wealth Management Segment Operating Results 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Advice & Wealth Management pretax operating earnings were $210 million as slower market appreciation and volatility resulted in lower revenue growth, which was offset by continued effective general and administrative expense management. Fourth quarter 2015 pretax operating margin was 16.6 percent, reflecting lower market appreciation and a slowdown in client activity related to market volatility, compared to 17.0 percent a year ago. For the full year, pretax operating margin increased to 17.1 percent from 16.5 percent. 

Operating net revenues grew 1 percent to $1.3 billion driven by growth in fee-based accounts from client net inflows partially offset by lower client activity levels given equity market volatility and uncertainty in the environment. 

Operating expenses increased 2 percent to $1.1 billion as growth in wrap assets resulted in higher distribution expenses. General and administrative expenses were flat compared to a year ago. 

Total retail client assets increased 1 percent to $447 billion compared to the prior year as client net inflows and client acquisition were offset by year-over-year market depreciation. Underlying business fundamentals and metrics remained strong and are consistent with the market environment. Wrap net inflows were $2.1 billion in the quarter, which contributed to a 3 percent increase in wrap balances to $180 billion. Total advisors were 9,789 reflecting strong retention and another successful recruiting quarter, with 82 experienced advisors moving their practices to Ameriprise. The combination of asset growth and client activity drove a 4 percent increase in operating net revenue per advisor on a trailing 12-month basis to $514,000.

NM Not Meaningful — variance of greater than 100% 

Asset Management pretax operating earnings were $193 million, which included a net benefit from several timing-related items that were more than offset by lower AUM related to weak global markets and net outflows. Results in the quarter included elevated performance fees, CLO liquidation benefits, and higher year-end related expenses that on a net basis benefited earnings by approximately $20 million. Fourth quarter adjusted net pretax operating margin was 36.3 percent compared to 40.0 percent a year ago. 

Operating net revenues were flat compared to a year ago as performance fees and CLO liquidation benefits were offset by the impact of lower asset levels. AUM declined 7 percent to $472 billion related to lower market appreciation, net outflows and a negative foreign exchange translation. 

Operating expenses were $640 million and included seasonally elevated general and administrative expenses relating to higher performance fees and CLO liquidation, investments in advertising and the timing of certain other expenses. These growth investments were partially offset by lower distribution expenses. 

Net outflows were $0.7 billion in the quarter, which included $8.7 billion of reinvested dividends and $6.5 billion of low-fee, former parent related outflows: 

· Elevated outflows in former parent related assets were largely driven by changes made by a former affiliated distribution partner that resulted in expected outflows of low fee institutional assets. 

· European retail net inflows were strong at $1.4 billion in the quarter. Retail flows in the United States included $1.7 billion of outflows in the Acorn Fund, which more than offset areas of improved retail flows. 

· Excluding outflows from a large client who redeemed assets for liquidity purposes, underlying third party institutional flows were positive and the pipeline remains strong.

 Annuities Segment Operating Results 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

NM Not Meaningful — variance of greater than 100% 

Annuities pretax operating earnings were $152 million primarily reflecting improved variable annuity profitability offset by lower fixed annuity earnings driven by the continued anticipated run-off of a block of fixed annuities. 

Variable annuity operating earnings were $129 million compared to $123 million a year ago. Variable annuity cash sales increased 12 percent to $1.3 billion for the quarter, driven by new living benefit riders. Account balances declined 4 percent to $74 billion reflecting net outflows in a closed block of annuities sold through third parties and market depreciation. 

Fixed annuity operating earnings declined from $36 million to $23 million as older policies continue to lapse and the interest rate environment which remains challenging for investment yields and limits new sales.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

NM Not Meaningful — variance of greater than 100% 

Protection pretax operating earnings were $35 million compared to $30 million a year ago. 

Life and Health insurance earnings included a $28 million life insurance reserve reduction that was a result of an assumption change. This benefit was partially offset by higher life and LTC claims, the impact of continued low interest rates, and the business mix shift from VUL to iUL. VUL/UL cash sales were $91 million, up 7 percent from a year ago, and VUL/UL account balances declined 1 percent. 

Auto and Home had an operating loss in the quarter driven by a $57 million reserve increase primarily related to the 2014 and prior accident years for the auto line and a more gradual pace of anticipated improvement in the book. Results reflected increases in both frequency and severity, which is consistent with industry experience. 

Performance for the 2015 accident year currently remains in line with expectations, benefiting from enhancements made to underwriting and claims practices.
