On February 23, 2016, the Company completed the offering of the Notes.

The Supplemental Indenture, along with the Base Indenture, each as amended and supplemented, govern the terms of the Notes.  

In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a Prospectus Supplement, dated February 18, 2016, and a Prospectus, dated April 30, 2014, which was included as part of the Company’s shelf registration statement (File No. 333-195601) that became effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, when filed with the SEC on April 30, 2014.
