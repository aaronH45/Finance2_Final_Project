CHICAGO, January 27, 2016 – The Boeing Company [NYSE: BA] reported fourth-quarter revenue of $23.6 billion and core earnings per share (Non-GAAP)* of $1.60 (Table 1). Fourth quarter 2015 results reflect the previously announced $569 million after-tax charge ($0.84 per share) on the 747 program as a result of a slow recovery in the air cargo market which was partially offset by solid core operating performance across the company. GAAP earnings per share was $1.51.

Revenue rose 6 percent in the full year to a record $96.1 billion reflecting record commercial deliveries. Core earnings per share (Non-GAAP)* totaled $7.72 for the full year, reflecting the KC-46 Tanker (2Q) and 747 program (4Q) charges ($1.61 per share) partially offset by strong core operating performance across the company. GAAP earnings per share totaled $7.44 for the full year.

Core earnings per share (non-GAAP)* guidance for 2016 is set at between $8.15 and $8.35, while GAAP earnings per share is established at between $8.45 and $8.65. Revenue guidance is between $93 and $95 billion, including commercial deliveries of between 740 and 745. Operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $10 billion. 

“Building on our foundation of solid core operating performance and customer focus, Boeing extended its leadership of the aerospace industry in 2015 with record deliveries and revenues in commercial airplanes, and solid sales and healthy margins in our defense and space business. We also generated significant cash flow to fuel investments in innovation and our people, and provide compelling returns to our shareholders,” said Boeing President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg. “With clear strategies and strong positions in our markets, a large and diverse order backlog worth nearly $500 billion, and multiple additional production rate increases planned yet this decade, we are well positioned for profitable growth and higher cash flow as we move into our second century in business.”

“Our priorities for 2016 and beyond are to build on our existing strengths to deliver on current plans and commitments, and to stretch beyond them by accelerating progress on key enterprise growth and productivity initiatives, investing in our team, and creating more value and opportunity for our customers, shareholders and employees,” Muilenburg said.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating cash flow in the quarter was $3.1 billion, reflecting commercial airplane production rates, solid core operating performance and the timing of receipts and expenditures in the prior period (Table 2). During the quarter, the company repurchased 5 million shares for $0.8 billion and paid $0.6 billion in dividends. For the full year, the company repurchased 47 million shares for $6.8 billion and paid $2.5 billion in dividends. Based on strong cash generation and outlook, in December, the board of directors raised the share repurchase authorization to $14 billion, replacing the authorization approved in 2014 of which $5.3 billion was remaining, and increased the quarterly dividend 20 percent. Share repurchases under the new authorization are expected to be made over the next two to three years.

Non-GAAP Measures Disclosures

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company’s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided: 

Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share 

Core operating earnings is defined as GAAP earnings from operations excluding unallocated pension and post-retirement expense. Core operating margin is defined as core operating earnings expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings per share is defined as GAAP diluted earnings per share excluding the net earnings per share impact of unallocated pension and post-retirement expense. Unallocated pension and post-retirement expense represents the portion of pension and other post-retirement costs that are not recognized by business segments for segment reporting purposes. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude unallocated pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided on page 14. 

Operating Cash Flow Before Pension Contributions 

Operating cash flow before pension contributions is defined as GAAP operating cash flow without pension contributions. Management believes operating cash flow before pension contributions provides additional insights into underlying business performance. Management uses operating cash flow before pension contributions as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. Table 2 provides a reconciliation between GAAP operating cash flow and operating cash flow before pension contributions. 

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is defined as GAAP operating cash flow without capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment additions. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. Table 2 provides a reconciliation between GAAP operating cash flow and free cash flow.
