   Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.    

  On January 25, 2016, consistent with Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law and in light of a recent ruling by the Delaware Chancery Court in a proceeding not involving Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (the "Company"), the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has amended Article III, Section 9, of the Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws to provide that directors may be removed in a manner consistent with Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and amended Article VIII, Section 1 to remove references to Article III, Section 9. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Amended and Restated Bylaws, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

 The Board also proposed and declared advisable amendments to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as follows: to Article NINTH, paragraph (f) to provide that directors may be removed in a manner consistent with Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, to Article TWELFTH to remove references to Article III, Section 9 of the By-Laws, and to Article THIRTEENTH, to provide that it shall not apply to Article NINTH, paragraph (f).

In addition, the Board has approved a resolution directing the Company not to enforce the current Article NINTH, paragraph (f) in its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, such that the Board will comply with Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and any director of the Company’s Board or the entire Board may be removed, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the Corporation’s then outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

 The amendment to the By-Laws was effective as of January 25, 2016. The Board directed that the proposed amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation be proposed for stockholder approval at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders to be held on May 16, 2016.

A copy of the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company are filed as Exhibit 3.2 and are incorporated herein by reference.
