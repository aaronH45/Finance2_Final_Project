NEWS RELEASE 

HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2015 AND ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER DIVIDEND 

BETHESDA, MD; February 17, 2016 – Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE: HST), (“Host Hotels” or the “Company”), the nation’s largest lodging real estate investment trust (“REIT”), today announced results of operations for the fourth quarter and the year.  

“In addition to having a solid quarter, especially from a bottom-line perspective, we undertook a number of initiatives in 2015 to capitalize on value-enhancing opportunities and better position Host Hotels for continued growth and success,” said W. Edward Walter, Chief Executive Officer. “In line with our disciplined approach to actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital, we sold more than $1 billion of non-core hotels, including hotels sold through joint ventures, returned more than $1.3 billion to stockholders through dividends and our stock repurchase program, invested more than $1 billion in new assets and capital improvements, and repaid or refinanced more than $1.4 billion of debt. Continually improving operational and financial performance and closing the gap between asset value and share price remain our top priorities. We are confident that we are taking the right steps to drive continued growth and value creation.”  

Operating Results  

(in millions, except per share and hotel statistics)  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures.  

(2)  

Net income for 2014 includes a net gain of $69 million, or $.09 of diluted earnings per share for settlement of litigation.  

Fourth quarter and full year 2015 results reflect the following:  

·  

Comparable RevPAR on a constant dollar basis improved 3.6% for the quarter, reflecting a 1.7% increase in average room rate and a 140 basis point increase in occupancy to 74%. For the full year, the Company’s comparable RevPAR on a constant dollar basis increased 3.8%, reflecting rate growth of 3.3%, while occupancy improved 40 basis points to 77.4%. Additionally, the implementation of the previously disclosed adoption of the 11th Edition of the Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry (“USALI”) negatively impacted RevPAR by approximately 30 basis points in the quarter and 20 basis points in the full year. 

·  

Comparable RevPAR at the Company’s domestic properties improved 3.2% for the quarter and 3.8% for the full year. The strongest domestic markets during the quarter were Florida and Los Angeles, where comparable RevPAR increased 11.7% and 9.8%, respectively. The Company’s New York and Houston hotels continued to lag the portfolio with a decrease in comparable RevPAR for the quarter of 2.4% and 1.1%, respectively. For the full year, the Company’s west coast properties led RevPAR growth with strong increases in the San Diego, Los Angeles, Seattle, and San Francisco markets.  

·  

On a constant dollar basis, RevPAR at the Company’s comparable international properties increased 15.5% for the fourth quarter due to increases of 39.1% and 10.4% in the Company’s Latin America and Asia-Pacific markets, respectively. For the full year, RevPAR for the Company’s international properties increased 2.2%, with RevPAR increases in Latin America and Asia-Pacific markets offset by declines in Canada, which were largely associated with renovation activity.  

·  

Comparable food and beverage revenues increased 6.1% for the quarter as a result of improved banquet and audio-visual business, as several large group events experienced increased attendance and additional spend. For the full year, the increase in revenues was 5.2%, reflecting strong second half of the year performance. The implementation of USALI increased food and beverage performance by approximately 140 and 270 basis points for the quarter and full year, respectively. 

·  

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins increased 55 basis points for the quarter and 20 basis points for full year, leading to an increase in Comparable Hotel EBITDA of 5.8% and 4.1%, respectively. The Company’s comparable hotel EBITDA margins were affected by the adoption of USALI, which reduced margins by approximately 3 basis points and 15 basis points for the quarter and full year, respectively.  

·  

Net income was $166 million in the fourth quarter and $571 million for the full year. Net income was affected by the items noted above, as well as by debt extinguishment costs and a gain on litigation settlement. Debt extinguishment costs increased $20 million and $37 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter and full year, compared to the same periods in 2014. The Company also recognized a $69 million litigation settlement gain in its full year 2014 net income.  

Share Repurchase Program and Dividends 

“During the fourth quarter, we continued to implement our plan to take advantage of the arbitrage between public and private market valuations, and repurchased 19.6 million shares for a total purchase price of $325 million” said Gregory J. Larson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the full year, the Company repurchased 38.3 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $675 million. The Company currently has $325 million  

Page 2 of 28 

of repurchase capacity under its share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2015. The common stock may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions, from time to time, through December 31, 2016 depending upon market conditions. The plan does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at its discretion. 

The Company’s dividend policy is that it generally intends to distribute, over time, 100% of its taxable income, which is dependent primarily on the Company’s results of operations, as well as the tax gains and losses from property sales. The Company paid a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share on its common stock on January 15, 2016 to stockholders of record as of December 31, 2015. On February 16, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share on its common stock, which equates to a 5.4% annualized yield based on the Company’s current stock price. The dividend will be paid on April 15, 2016, to stockholders of record on March 31, 2016. The Company is committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend, subject to approval by the Company’s Board of Directors. 

Capital Allocation  

Acquisition opportunities were limited by continued low interest rates, which increased competition and drove premium pricing for high-quality properties in the Company’s major markets or asset types. During 2015, the Company acquired The Phoenician, a 643-room Luxury Collection resort in Scottsdale, Arizona for $400 million and, during the fourth quarter, the long-term ground lease associated with the Marriott Minneapolis for $34 million. Conversely, this environment has helped the Company successfully execute on its strategic plan of reallocating capital out of markets where it expects lower growth or higher capital expenditure requirements. Proceeds from these sales have been utilized as a source of funds for the Company’s stock repurchase program, capital expenditure programs, and other corporate initiatives. Subsequent to year-end, the Company sold two non-core assets, the 139-room Novotel Wellington, New Zealand and the 350-room San Diego Marriott Mission Valley for a total sales price of approximately $98 million and recorded a total gain of $56 million. The following table is a summary of our completed and pending disposition activity (in US$, in millions):

Owned by the Company's joint venture in Europe. Net proceeds are based on the Company's ownership percentage.  

(2)  

Owned by the Company's joint venture in Asia. Net proceeds are based on the Company's ownership percentage. 

(3)  

Represents three hotels currently under contract that are subject to various closing conditions. There can be no assurances that these properties will be sold within this time period or at the sales prices indicated. 

The net impact on the Company’s forecast as a result of the 2016 sales discussed above, including three properties under contract, is a decrease to net income (excluding gain on sale) and Adjusted EBITDA of $8 million and $14 million, respectively. 

Redevelopment, Return On Investment (“ROI”) and Acquisition Capital Projects 

The Company invested approximately $100 million and $275 million in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, on redevelopment, ROI, and acquisition capital expenditures. Projects opened during the fourth quarter include the complete repositionings of the Houston Airport Marriott at George Bush Intercontinental, The Logan, Philadelphia, Curio – A Collection by Hilton, and The Camby Hotel, Phoenix, part of Marriott’s Autograph Collection. During January 2016, the Company also opened the completely repositioned and rebranded Axiom Hotel San Francisco, which had been closed since January, 2015. The Company’s forecast reflects an increase to both net income and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $32 million to $34 million compared to 2015, as a result of the completion of these four projects.  

For 2016, the Company expects to invest approximately $180 million to $195 million in redevelopment projects, ROI, and acquisition capital expenditures or a decline of approximately $88 million from 2015. These projects, which will result in the hotels being classified as non-comparable in 2016, include:  

·  

The Phoenician – In conjunction with the recent acquisition, the Company intends to complete a comprehensive two year renovation. The first phase includes the renovation of all guestrooms during summer 2016, while the renovation of public space, spa, and restaurants is scheduled for 2017.  

·  

Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport – The renovation commenced in November 2015 and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016. The project includes all of the guestrooms and bathrooms, meeting space, the repositioning of the atrium into a new restaurant and lounge and conversion of the existing restaurant and sports bar to approximately 15,000 square feet of additional meeting space.  

·  

Denver Marriott Tech Center – The extensive project started in November 2015 and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. The project includes renovation of guestrooms and bathrooms, conversion of 64 rooms to 41 suites, conversion of the concierge lounge into three meeting rooms, and the repositioning of the public space and food and beverage areas.  

·  

Marriott Marquis San Diego Marina – The Company is approximately 75% through construction of the $106 million all-new two-level exhibition hall. Upon completion, the hotel will provide approximately 280,000 square feet of expanded and modernized conference and meeting space that will include two 36,000 square-foot ballrooms, each capable of accommodating up to 3,700 guests. The project, which is scheduled to be completed this summer, will include customizable space with state-of-the-art meeting amenities such as a 12-screen video wall system, offering the highest level of videography, sound, and production capabilities. 

Renewal and Replacement Expenditures 

The Company invested approximately $91 million and $388 million in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, in renewal and replacement capital expenditures. For 2016, the Company expects to invest between $310 million to  

Page 4 of 28 

$325 million, a decrease of over $60 million, or approximately 18%. Significant projects completed during the fourth quarter include the renovation of 295 rooms at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort, Naples, the restaurant at The Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island and the 3030 Ocean Restaurant & Bar at the Fort Lauderdale Marriott Harbor Beach Resort & Spa.  

For 2016, renewal and replacement capital expenditures include room renovations at The Ritz-Carlton, Tysons Corner, Fort Lauderdale Marriott Harbor Beach Resort & Spa, and W Seattle and the renovation of the ballroom and event lawn at the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa.  

European Joint Venture  

The European joint venture’s comparable hotel RevPAR, on a constant euro basis (which excludes the eight hotels sold in October) increased approximately 1.7% and 4.2% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, and was significantly impacted by the November terrorist attacks in Paris. The increase in comparable hotel RevPAR resulted in a total revenue increase of 1.0% and 2.5% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, at the European joint venture’s comparable properties on a constant euro basis.  

Balance Sheet  

The Company believes that its strong balance sheet is a key competitive advantage that affords it a low cost of capital and the necessary financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities throughout the lodging cycle. The Company’s long term unsecured debt currently maintains an investment grade rating. At December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $239 million of cash, $702 million of available capacity under its revolving credit facility, and $4.0 billion of debt. Additionally, the five hotels either sold or under contract noted in the table on page 3 are expected to generate a total sales price of $215 million, which is not included in the year-end balances.  

On December 29, 2015, the Company drew the remaining $200 million available under its 2015 Term Loan facility. During the year, the Company repaid or refinanced $1.4 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.0% with proceeds from the issuance of $1.5 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%. As a result of these transactions, the Company decreased its weighted average interest rate by 110 basis points to 3.7%, lowered its annualized interest expense by $24 million to $165 million, and extended its weighted average debt maturity by 0.8 years to 6.0 years, with no significant maturities until 2019, assuming the Company exercises the extensions on its credit facility.

2016 Outlook  

For 2016, while the overall economic outlook remains uncertain reflecting the significant weakness in oil prices and the recent slowdown of the Chinese economy, the Company expects to benefit from its 2015 value enhancement and rebranding initiatives and, based on current group bookings, expects to continue to drive earnings growth. Additionally, the below guidance includes the five hotel dispositions noted in the table on page 3, as well as the related reduction to Adjusted EBITDA of $14 million and net income (excluding gain on sale) of $8 million. Therefore, the Company anticipates that its 2016 operating results will be in the following range:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Based upon the above parameters, the Company estimates its 2016 guidance as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

See the 2016 Forecast Schedules and the Notes to Financial Information for other assumptions used in the forecasts and items that may affect forecast results. The 2016 Adjusted EBITDA forecasts for the Houston Airport Marriott, The Logan, Curio, The Camby Hotel and the Axiom hotel included on page 4 are based on estimates of operating performance metrics, including expected occupancy, average room rate, mix of group and transient customers, as well as market specific estimates of demand drivers. This also includes estimated costs such as utilities, marketing, general overhead costs, and management fees. Each of these hotels has been completely repositioned and three of the hotels will be operated by a new management company. For these reasons, historical operating data is not predictive of future results and there can be no assurances that the Company will achieve these 2016 forecasts due to less than expected demand or a slower than expected ramp-up in operations.

Non-comparable hotels - Renovations/pro forma acquisitions - This represents six hotels under significant renovations: The Camby Hotel (previously The Ritz-Carlton, Phoenix), The Logan (previously the Four Seasons Philadelphia), the Houston Airport Marriott at George Bush Intercontinental, the Marriott Marquis San Diego Marina, the San Cristobal Tower, Santiago and the Sheraton Santiago Hotel & Convention Center. It also includes: The Phoenician which was acquired in June 2015, the YVE Hotel Miami which was acquired in August 2014 and The Axiom Hotel which was acquired in January 2014. We were able to obtain historical operating data for periods prior to our ownership for the three hotels acquired in 2015 and 2014, which are presented on a pro forma basis assuming we owned the hotels as of January 1, 2014. As a result, the RevPAR decrease of 20.2% and 18.1% for the quarter and full year 2015, respectively, for these nine hotels is considered non-comparable. 

·  

Non-comparable hotels - Development - This represents hotels that were under development and includes the Novotel and ibis Rio de Janeiro Parque Olimpico hotels, which we developed and were opened late in the fourth quarter of 2014. As a result, the RevPAR change for the quarter for these hotels is considered non-meaningful (N/M).

Schedule of Comparable Hotel Results (1)

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

As previously disclosed, the adoption of the 11th edition of the Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry (“USALI”) on January 1, 2015 will impact our comparative operating results. The impact of USALI in both the fourth quarter and full year 2015 reduced comparable RevPAR growth by approximately 30 and 20 basis points, respectively. In addition, the impact of USALI in the fourth quarter and full year 2015 reduced comparable hotel EBITDA margins by approximately 3 and 15 basis points, respectively, while increasing comparable food and beverage revenue growth by approximately 140 and 270 basis points, respectively. These changes did not affect net income, comparable hotel EBITDA, or Adjusted EBITDA. See the Notes to Financial Information for a discussion of non-GAAP measures and the calculation of comparable hotel results. For additional information on comparable hotel EBITDA by market, see the supplemental information posted on our website. 

(2)  

Operating profit margins are calculated by dividing the applicable operating profit by the related revenue amount. GAAP operating profit margins are calculated using amounts presented in the consolidated statements of operations. Comparable hotel EBITDA margins are calculated using amounts presented in the above table.  

(3)  

The reconciliation of total food and beverage sales per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable food and beverage sales is as follows (as discussed above, 2014 amounts have not been adjusted for the adoption of the 11th edition of USALI):

As of September 30, 2014, we had accrued litigation losses totaling $69 million for litigation related to the ground lease for the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter in 2005. On October 3, 2014 the final motion for rehearing by Keystone-Texas Property Holding Corporation to the Texas Supreme Court was denied. As a result, in the third quarter of 2014, we reversed the $69 million loss contingency, which was included as a reduction to corporate expense in net income. Consistent with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FFO, we had excluded $59 million of the gain, as the related accrual for these amounts were similarly excluded in prior years. We included $10 million of the gain in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FFO, which represents periodic interest accrued on the judgments since 2010, as this amount was included as a reduction in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FFO in prior years.

Earnings per diluted share and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share are adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans, preferred OP units held by non-controlling partners, exchangeable debt securities and other non-controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited partnership interests to common OP units. No effect is shown for securities if they are anti-dilutive.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

___________ 

(1)  

The forecasts are based on the below assumptions:  

·  

Total comparable hotel RevPAR in constant US$ will increase 3.0% to 4.0% for the low and high end of the forecast range, which excludes the effect of changes in foreign currency. However, the effect of estimated changes in foreign currency has been reflected in the forecast of net income, EBITDA, earnings per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. 

·  

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will increase from zero to 40 basis points for the low and high ends of the forecasted range, respectively. 

·  

We expect to spend approximately $180 million to $195 million on ROI/redevelopment and acquisition capital expenditures and approximately $310 million to $325 million on renewal and replacement expenditures.  

·  

We have adjusted the above forecasts for the sale of the Novotel Wellington and San Diego Marriott Mission Valley, which were sold in the first quarter, and three hotels that are currently under contract that are subject to various closing conditions which may not be satisfied. There can be no assurances that these properties will be sold within this time period or at the sales prices indicated. 

For a discussion of additional items that may affect forecasted results, see the Notes to Financial Information.

Notes to Financial Information 

Forecasts   

Our forecast of earnings per diluted share, NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, comparable hotel EBITDA margins, and cash interest expense are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR and margin growth; the amount and timing of acquisitions and dispositions of hotel properties is an estimate that can substantially affect financial results, including such items as net income, depreciation and gains on dispositions; the level of capital expenditures may change significantly, which will directly affect the level of depreciation expense and net income; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions, which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.  

Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics  

To facilitate a quarter-to-quarter comparison of our operations, we present certain operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis. 

Because these statistics and operating results relate only to our hotel properties, they exclude results for our non-hotel properties and other real estate investments. We define our comparable hotels as properties:  

(i) that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared; and  

(ii) that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or undergone large-scale capital projects (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.  

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally, hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large scale capital project that would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set is an extensive renovation of several core aspects of the hotel, such as rooms, meeting space, lobby, bars, restaurants and other public spaces. Both quantitative and qualitative factors are taken into consideration in determining if the renovation would cause a hotel to be removed from the comparable hotel set, including unusual or exceptional circumstances such as: a reduction or increase in room count, rebranding, a significant alteration of the business operations, or the closing of the hotel during the renovation.  

We do not include an acquired hotel in our comparable hotel set until the operating results for that hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year. For example, we acquired The Phoenician in June 2015. The hotel will not be included in our comparable hotels until January 1, 2017. Hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed. Similarly, hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption or commence a large-scale capital project. In each case, these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after completion of the repair of the property damage or cessation of the business interruption, or the completion of large-scale capital projects, as applicable.  

Of the 107 hotels that we owned on December 31, 2015, 96 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following hotels that we owned as of December 31, 2015 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:  

Renovations/pro forma acquisitions: Hotels undergoing large-scale capital projects, as well as new acquisitions where comparable historical information for periods prior to our ownership is available:  

·  

The Camby Hotel (previously The Ritz-Carlton, Phoenix), removed in the third quarter of 2015 (business disruption due to rebranding, including closure of the hotel in July 2015 for extensive renovation work); 

·  

Sheraton Santiago Hotel & Convention Center and San Cristobal Tower, Santiago, removed in the second quarter of 2015 (business interruption due to extensive guestroom renovation and reconfiguration, which requires temporary closure of a significant portion of the guestrooms); 

·  

The Logan (previously the Four Seasons Philadelphia), removed in the first quarter of 2015 (business interruption due to rebranding, including closure of the hotel in order to expedite renovation efforts); 

·  

Houston Airport Marriott at George Bush Intercontinental, removed in the first quarter of 2015 (business interruption due to complete repositioning of the hotel, including guest room renovations and the closure of two restaurants to create a new food and beverage outlet and lobby experience);  

·  

Marriott Marquis San Diego Marina, removed in the first quarter of 2015 (business interruption due to the demolition of the existing conference center and new exhibit hall);  

·  

The Phoenician (acquired in June 2015);

The operating results of thirteen hotels disposed of in 2015 and 2014 are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein. These operations are also excluded from the hotel operating data for all owned hotels on pages 10 and 11.  

Operating statistics for the non-comparable hotels listed above are included in the hotel operating data for all owned hotels. By definition, the RevPAR results for these properties are not comparable due to the reasons listed above, and, therefore, are not indicative of the overall trends for our portfolio. The operating results for the three hotels acquired in 2015 and 2014 are included in the all owned hotel operating data on a pro forma basis, which includes operating results assuming they were owned as of January 1, 2014 and based on actual results obtained from the managers for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. All owned hotel operating statistics are provided for completeness and to show the difference between our comparable hotel information (upon which we usually evaluate performance) and all of our hotels, including non-comparable hotels. Also, while they may not be illustrative of trends (as compared to comparable hotel operating statistics), changes in all owned hotel statistics will have an effect on our overall revenues. We also present all owned hotel statistics for our joint venture in Europe using the same methodology as our consolidated hotels.  

We evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both market and property type. These divisions are generally consistent with groupings recognized in the lodging industry.

Constant US$, Nominal US$ and Constant Euros  

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. For comparative purposes, we also present the RevPAR  

Page 24 of 28 

HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. 

Notes to Financial Information 

results for the prior year assuming the results for our foreign operations were translated using the same exchange rates that were effective for the comparable periods in the current year, thereby eliminating the effect of currency fluctuation for the year-over-year comparisons. For the full year forecast results, we use the applicable forward currency curve (as published by Bloomberg L.P.) for each monthly period to estimate forecast foreign operations in U.S. dollars and have restated the prior year RevPAR results using the same forecast exchange rates to estimate year-over-year growth in RevPAR in constant US$. We believe this presentation is useful to investors as it shows growth in RevPAR in the local currency of the hotel consistent with how we would evaluate our domestic portfolio. However, the estimated effect of changes in foreign currency has been reflected in the actual and forecast results of net income, EBITDA, earnings per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. Nominal US$ results include the effect of currency fluctuations, consistent with our financial statement presentation.  

We also present RevPAR results for our joint venture in Europe in constant Euros using the same methodology as used for the constant US$ presentation.  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted), (ii) EBITDA, (iii) Adjusted EBITDA and (iv) Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.  

NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share  

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period, in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains and losses from sales of real estate, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation, amortization and impairments and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.  

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairments and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its April 2002 “White Paper on Funds From Operations,” since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.  

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share  

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s complete understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:  

·  

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.  

·  

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.  

Page 25 of 28 

HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. 

Notes to Financial Information 

·  

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.   

In unusual circumstances, we may also adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example, in 2013, management excluded the $11 million gain from the eminent domain claim for land for which we received the cash proceeds in 2007, but, pending the resolution of certain contingencies, was not recognized until 2013. Typically, gains from the disposition of non-depreciable property are included in the determination of NAREIT and Adjusted FFO.  

EBITDA  

Earnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.  

Adjusted EBITDA  

Historically, management has adjusted EBITDA when evaluating the performance of Host Inc. and Host LP because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor’s complete understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA also is a relevant measure in calculating certain credit ratios. We adjust EBITDA for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA:  

·  

Real Estate Transactions – We exclude the effect of gains and losses, including the amortization of deferred gains, recorded on the disposition or acquisition of depreciable assets and property insurance gains in our consolidated statement of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDA is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition, material gains or losses from the depreciated book value of the disposed assets could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets as noted above.  

·  

Equity Investment Adjustments – We exclude the equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates as presented in our consolidated statement of operations because it includes our pro rata portion of the depreciation, amortization and interest expense related to such investments, which are excluded from EBITDA. We include our pro rata share of the Adjusted EBITDA of our equity investments as we believe this reflects more accurately the performance of our investments. The pro rata Adjusted EBITDA of equity investments is defined as the EBITDA of our equity investments adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by our percentage ownership in the partnership or joint venture.  

·  

Consolidated Partnership Adjustments – We deduct the non-controlling partners’ pro rata share of Adjusted EBITDA of our consolidated partnerships as this reflects the non-controlling owners’ interest in the EBITDA of our consolidated partnerships. The pro rata Adjusted EBITDA of non-controlling partners is defined as the EBITDA of our consolidated partnerships adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by the non-controlling partners’ percentage ownership in the partnership or joint venture.  

·  

Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle – Infrequently, the Financial Accounting Standards Board promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We exclude these one-time adjustments because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period.  

·  

Impairment Losses – We exclude the effect of impairment expense recorded because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDA is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets. In addition, we believe that impairment expense, which is based on historical cost book values, is similar to gains and losses on dispositions and depreciation expense, both of which are excluded from EBITDA.  

·  

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company.  

Page 26 of 28 

HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. 

Notes to Financial Information 

·  

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business, which is consistent with the definition of Adjusted FFO that we adopted effective January 1, 2011. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.   

In unusual circumstances, we may also adjust EBITDA for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example, in 2013, management excluded the $11 million gain from the eminent domain claim for land for which we received the cash proceeds in 2007, but, pending the resolution of certain contingencies, was not recognized until 2013. Typically, gains from the disposition of non-depreciable property are included in the determination of Adjusted EBITDA.  

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share, Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA  

We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although FFO per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other REITs, it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share, which is not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may also not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA purposes only) and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, NAREIT FFO per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as a measure of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.  

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results  

We present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, EBITDA (and the related margin) and food and beverage adjusted profit (and the related margin), on a comparable hotel, or “same store,” basis as supplemental information for investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions, significant property damage or large scale capital improvements incurred during these periods. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense), and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Corporate-level costs and expenses are also removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by region and for the Company’s comparable properties in the aggregate. We eliminate depreciation and amortization because, even though depreciation and amortization are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient by themselves.  

As a result of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization, the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC. 

Notes to Financial Information 

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors, such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a “same store” supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of these hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results. For these reasons, we believe that comparable hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.
