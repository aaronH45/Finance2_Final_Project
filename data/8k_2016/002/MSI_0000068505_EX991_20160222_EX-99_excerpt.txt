  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 * Q4 Non-GAAP financial information excludes the after-tax impact of approximately $0.02 per diluted share related to share-based compensation, intangible assets amortization expense and highlighted items for the fourth-quarter. Details on these non-GAAP adjustments and the use of non-GAAP measures are included later in this news release.  

OTHER SELECTED FOURTH-QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  

   •   Revenue - Sales decreased 8 percent, including $54 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact. These results reflect a 1 percent decline in North America, or flat when excluding the impact of currency. Overall company product sales declined 10 percent due primarily to weakness in Latin America and Europe. The Services business declined 3 percent due to currency headwinds, lower iDEN revenue and a decline in systems integration revenues in Norway.  

   •   Operating margin - GAAP operating margin was 23.1 percent of sales in the fourth quarter of 2015; non-GAAP operating margin was 27.2 percent of sales, compared with 26.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014. Improved non-GAAP results reflect $45 million in lower operating expenses compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, due to the company’s cost reduction initiatives, lower pension expense and a stronger dollar.  

   •   Taxes - The fourth quarter of 2015 GAAP effective tax rate was 26 percent. This compares with a tax rate of 38 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, which was driven by the loss from continuing operations. The fourth quarter of 2015 non-GAAP tax rate was 31 percent compared with a tax rate of 35 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014.  

   •   Cash flow - The company generated $414 million in operating cash flow from continuing operations during the quarter, reflecting solid execution across all working capital accounts. Free cash flow was $370 million in the quarter. The increase was largely driven by lower pension contributions and improved cost structure.

OTHER SELECTED FULL-YEAR FINANCIAL RESULTS  

   •   Revenue - Sales decreased 3 percent, including $201 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact. These results reflect 3 percent growth in North America, which delivered improvements in both Products and Services sales in state and local governments. Overall company product sales declined 3 percent due to currency headwinds and weakness in Latin America and Europe. The Services business declined 3 percent primarily due to currency headwinds, lower iDEN revenue and a decline in systems integration revenues in Norway.  

   •   Operating margin - For the full year, GAAP operating margin was 17.5 percent of sales in 2015, compared with (17.1) percent for the full year of 2014. 2014 results include a $1.9 billion non-recurring charge related to U.S. pension de-risking actions. For the full year, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.5 percent of sales in 2015, compared with 18.2 percent for the full year of 2014 driven primarily by lower operating expenses.  

   •   Taxes - The 2015 GAAP effective tax rate was 30 percent. This compares with a full-year GAAP effective tax rate of 40 percent in 2014. The full year 2015 non-GAAP tax rate was 33 percent, compared with a tax rate of 32 percent in 2014.  

   •   Cash flow - The company generated $1.0 billion in operating cash from continuing operations, reflecting an increase of $1.7 billion over the prior year. Free cash flow was $830 million in the year. The increase was largely driven by lower pension contributions and improved earnings performance.

CONSOLIDATED GAAP RESULTS (presented in millions, except per share data)  

A comparison of results from operations is as follows:

HIGHLIGHTED ITEMS AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE  

The table below includes highlighted items, share-based compensation expense and intangible amortization for the fourth quarter of 2015.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

In addition to the GAAP results included in this presentation, Motorola Solutions also has included non-GAAP measurements of results. The company has provided these non-GAAP measurements to help investors better understand its core operating performance, enhance comparisons of core operating performance from period to period and allow better comparisons of operating performance to its competitors. Among other things, management uses these operating results, excluding the identified items, to evaluate performance of the businesses and to evaluate results relative to certain incentive compensation targets. Management uses operating results excluding these items because it believes this measurement enables it to make better period-to-period evaluations of the financial performance of core business operations. The non-GAAP measurements are intended only as a supplement to the comparable GAAP measurements and the company compensates for the limitations inherent in the use of non-GAAP measurements by using GAAP measures in conjunction with the non-GAAP measurements. As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measurements in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  

Highlighted items: The company has excluded the effects of highlighted items (and any reversals of highlighted items recorded in prior periods) from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements because the company believes that these historical items do not reflect expected future operating earnings or expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company’s current operating performance or comparisons to the company’s past operating performance.  

Share-based compensation expense: The company has excluded share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements. Although share-based compensation is a key incentive offered to the company’s employees and the company believes such compensation contributed to the revenue earned during the periods presented and also believes it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, the company continues to evaluate its performance excluding share-based compensation expense primarily because it represents a significant non-cash expense. Share-based compensation expense will recur in future periods.  

Intangible assets amortization expense: The company has excluded intangible assets amortization expense from its Non-GAAP operating expenses and net earnings measurements, primarily because it represents a non-cash expense and because the company evaluates its performance excluding intangible assets amortization expense. Amortization of intangible assets is consistent in amount and frequency but is significantly affected by the timing and size of the company’s acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to the company’s revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to the company’s future period revenues as well. Intangible assets amortization expense will recur in future periods.  

Constant Currency: We evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We calculate constant currency percentages by converting our current period local currency results using prior-period exchange rates, and then comparing these adjusted values to prior period reported results.  

Details of the above items and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measurements to the corresponding GAAP measurements can be found at the end of this press release.
