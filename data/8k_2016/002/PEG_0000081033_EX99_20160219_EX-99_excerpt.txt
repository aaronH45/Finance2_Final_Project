PSEG ANNOUNCES 2015 RESULTS  

$3.30 NET INCOME PER SHARE  

Operating Earnings of $2.91 Per Share At Upper Half Of Guidance Of $2.85 - $2.95 Per Share  

Company Provides 2016 Guidance of $2.80 - $3.00 Per Share  

Common Dividend Increased 5.1%  

(February 19, 2016 – Newark, NJ) Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) reported today 2015 Net Income of $1,679 million or $3.30 per share as compared to Net Income of $1,518 million, or $2.99 per share for 2014. Operating Earnings for the year 2015 were $1,476 million or $2.91 per share compared to 2014 Operating Earnings of $1,400 million or $2.76 per share.  

PSEG also reported Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $309 million, or $0.60 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2014 Net Income of $476 million, or $0.94 per share. Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $255 million, or $0.50 per share compared to fourth quarter 2014 Operating Earnings of $247 million, or $0.49 per share.  

“We are very pleased with our strong results in 2015 with operating earnings for the full year at the upper half of our increased guidance” said Ralph Izzo, chairman, president and chief executive officer. “Our results reflect excellent performance and organic growth at the utility. With our strong balance sheet, we are in a position to increase our investment across the company to meet the needs of our customers and shareholders. The Board’s recent decision to increase the common dividend by 5.1% to the indicative annual level of $1.64 per share is an expression of confidence in our outlook, the continued growth of our regulated business and an acknowledgment of our strong financial condition.”  

PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of “Operating Earnings” provides a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand performance trends. Operating Earnings exclude the impact of gains/(losses) associated with Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) investments and Mark-To-Market (MTM) accounting as well as other material one-time items. The table below provides a reconciliation of PSEG’s Net Income to Operating Earnings (a non-GAAP measure) for the full year and fourth quarter. See Attachment 12 for a complete list of items excluded from Net Income in the determination of Operating Earnings.

Ralph Izzo went on to say, “Continued successful deployment of strong free cash flow into customer-oriented regulated investment programs is expected to support 14% growth in PSE&G’s earnings which will increase the utility’s earnings to 60% of Enterprise’s 2016 operating earnings. Results for 2016 are forecast at $2.80 - $3.00 per share.”

Operating Earnings Review and Outlook by Operating Subsidiary  

See Attachments 6 and 7 for detail regarding the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year earnings reconciliations for each of PSEG’s businesses.  

PSE&G  

PSE&G reported operating earnings of $156 million ($0.31 per share) for the fourth quarter bringing full year operating earnings to $787 million ($1.55 per share). On a comparative basis, PSE&G reported operating earnings of $160 million ($0.32 per share) and $725 million ($1.43 per share) for the fourth quarter and full year 2014, respectively.  

PSE&G’s earnings in the fourth quarter benefited from a return on the continued expansion of its investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure which partially offset the impact on earnings of unseasonably mild weather and an increase in operating expenses. For the full year, PSE&G’s management of operations and an expanded capital program allowed it to earn its authorized return on rate base.  

PSE&G’s return on an expanded investment in transmission and distribution programs increased quarter-over-quarter earnings by $0.03 per share. Mild weather conditions relative to normal, and to last year, reduced electric sales and lowered earnings comparisons by $0.01 per share. Recovery of gas revenue under the weather normalization clause offset the impact of the abnormally warm weather on the earnings effect of lower sales of gas. Higher expenses, including pension, and other items, reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons by $0.03 per share.  

Economic conditions in the service area continue to improve. On a weather-normalized basis, gas deliveries are estimated to have increased 2.1% in the quarter and 2.2% for the year. Demand continues to benefit from an improving economy and also from the impact of lower commodity prices on customers’ bills. Electric sales, on a weather-normalized basis, are estimated to have increased by 0.8% and 0.5% for the fourth quarter and the year respectively. The estimated year-over-year growth in electric sales is more indicative of our long-term expectations for growth.  

PSE&G implemented a $146 million increase in revenue under the company’s transmission formula rate on January 1, 2016. Transmission revenues are adjusted each year to reflect an update of data that was estimated in the transmission formula rate filing. The adjustment for 2016 will include the impact of the extension of bonus depreciation which would reduce our revenue increase as filed by $27 million. PSE&G’s investment in transmission grew in 2015 to $5.7 billion at year-end, or 43% of the company’s consolidated rate base of $13.4 billion at the end of the year.  

PSE&G’s operating earnings for 2016 are forecast at $875 million - $925 million.  

PSEG Power  

PSEG Power reported operating earnings of $95 million ($0.19 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2015 and Adjusted EBITDA of $235 million bringing full year operating earnings to $653 million ($1.29 per share) and Adjusted EBITDA to $1,563 million. Net Income for the quarter and the full year were $149 million and $856 million respectively. On a comparative basis, PSEG Power reported operating earnings of $91 million ($0.18 per share) and Adjusted EBITDA of $271 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and operating earnings of $642 million ($1.27 per share) and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,584 million for the full year 2014. Net Income in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the full year 2014 were $320 million and $760 million, respectively.  

PSEG believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of “Adjusted EBITDA” is useful in evaluating Power’s operating performance because it provides investors with additional information to compare our business performance to other companies and to understand performance trends.  

Adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our Operating Earnings measure, as well as income tax expense and interest expense, depreciation and amortization and major maintenance at Power’s fossil generation facilities. See Attachment 12 for a complete list of items excluded from Net Income in the determination of Adjusted EBITDA.  

Power’s results for the fourth quarter reflect the impact of strong hedging and tight control of operating expenses which offset an anticipated decline in capacity revenue, and the impact of unseasonably warm weather on wholesale energy prices.  

A decline in capacity revenues associated with the May 2015 retirement of peaking capacity in PJM reduced quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons by $0.04 per share. An increase in the average price received on energy hedges coupled with a decline in fuel costs more than offset the impact on earnings of a reduction in gas sales netting to a quarter-over-quarter improvement in earnings of $0.02 per share. Power’s O&M expense in the quarter was unchanged relative to year-ago levels. An increase in depreciation expense and miscellaneous items was more than offset by the absence of a charge in the year-ago quarter resulting in a net improvement in quarterly earnings comparisons of $0.03 per share.  

Output during the quarter was in-line with year ago levels. For the year, output increased 2% to 55.2 TWh, as improvements in availability and efficiency supported growth. The nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 90.4% for the year, producing 30 TWh (54% of generation). Efficient combined cycle gas turbine capacity (CCGT) was rewarded in the market with an increase in dispatch levels. Power’s CCGT fleet set a generation record during the year as the Linden Station and Bethlehem Energy Center set individual records. Output from the CCGT fleet grew 11% to 18.4 TWh (33% of total output) during the year. Lower market demand for our coal units reduced output from those stations to 5.8 TWh for the year (11% of total output) as the fleet’s peaking capacity produced 1.0 TWh (2% of total output).  

Power is expecting output for 2016 to remain unchanged at 54 – 56 TWh. Following completion of the Basic Generation Service (BGS) auction in New Jersey in February 2016, Power enters the year with 100% of its 2016 baseload generation hedged. Approximately 70% - 75% of anticipated annual production is hedged at an average price of $51 per MWh. Power has hedged approximately 45% - 55% of its forecast generation in 2017 of 54 – 56 TWh at an average price of $50 per MWh. For 2018, Power has hedged 15% - 20% of forecast production of 59 – 61 TWh at an average price of $54 per MWh. Power assumes BGS volumes will represent approximately 11 – 12 TWh in each of 2016 and 2017 – consistent with 11.5 TWh of deliveries in 2015 under the BGS contract.  

The forecast improvement in output for 2018 reflects the commercial start-up in mid-2018 of 1300 MWs of new gas-fired combined cycle capacity at the Keys and Sewaren stations.  

PSEG Power cleared a new 485-MW clean, natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant at its existing Bridgeport Harbor Station site. The unit, which represents an investment of more than $550 million, is targeted to be in operation in June 2019.  

Power’s operating earnings for 2016 are forecast at $490 million - $540 million. The forecast for operating earnings equates to estimated adjusted EBITDA for 2016 of $1,320 million - $1,400 million.  

PSEG Enterprise/Other  

PSEG Enterprise/Other reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $4 million compared to an operating earnings loss of $4 million ($0.01 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2014. The results for the fourth quarter brought operating earnings for the full year 2015 for PSEG Enterprise/Other to $36 million ($0.07 per share) versus Operating Earnings in 2014 of $33 million ($0.06 per share).  

The difference in operating earnings results quarter-over-quarter primarily reflects the absence of prior year tax adjustments and other items in the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as other Parent related expenses in 2015. For the year, PSEG Long Island contributed $0.02 per share to earnings, in line with expectations.  

For 2016, operating earnings for PSEG Enterprise/Other are forecast to be $60 million.  

Capital Expenditures  

PSEG currently plans to invest approximately $11.5 billion over 2016 – 2018 on capital programs at both PSE&G and PSEG Power. The planned investment program represents a 21% increase over the $9.5 billion invested over the prior three-year period and is expected to be invested in PSE&G (72%) and PSEG Power (27%).  

Pension Expense  

PSEG, at the end of 2015, changed the approach used to measure service and interest costs for pension and other post-retirement benefits. For 2016, PSEG has elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. This change does not affect the measurement of the plan obligations. PSEG estimates this change will reduce 2016 pension and OPEB expense by approximately $34 million and $13 million respectively, net of amounts capitalized. On a year-over-year basis, pension expense is expected to decline by $25 million from 2015’s level of expense.
