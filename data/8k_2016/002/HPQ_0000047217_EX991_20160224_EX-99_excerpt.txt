   N/M Not meaningful  

HP Inc. (HP) announced first quarter net revenue of $12.2 billion, down 12% from the prior-year period and down 5% in constant currency. 

First quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations was $0.36, down from $0.41 in the prior-year period and above the previously provided outlook of $0.27 to $0.32. First quarter non-GAAP diluted net EPS from continuing operations was $0.36, down from $0.41 in the prior-year period and within its previously provided outlook of $0.33 to $0.38. First quarter non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP diluted net EPS from continuing operations exclude after-tax costs of $5 million, rounding to $0.00 per diluted share, respectively, related to non-operating retirement-related credits, restructuring charges, and the amortization of intangible assets. 

“We have a clear strategy that leverages our strengths, and we are focused on execution, taking cost out of the business and delivering innovations that will

   amaze our customers and partners," said Dion Weisler, HP’s President and CEO. "Although we have some tough quarters ahead, I am confident in the future.”  

   Asset management  

   HP’s net cash used in operating activities in the first quarter was $108 million. Inventory ended the quarter at $4.1 billion, down 2 days quarter over quarter to 37 days. Accounts receivable ended the quarter at $4.1 billion, down 5 days quarter over quarter to 30 days. Accounts payable ended the quarter at $9.0 billion, down 11 days quarter over quarter to 82 days. HP’s dividend payment of $0.124 per share in the first quarter resulted in cash usage of $0.2 billion. HP also utilized $0.8 billion of cash during the quarter to repurchase approximately 67.0 million shares of common stock in the open market. HP exited the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash.  

   Fiscal 2016 first quarter segment results  

   ● Personal Systems net revenue was down 13% year over year (down 6% in constant currency) with a 3.1% operating margin. Commercial net revenue decreased 11% and Consumer net revenue decreased 16%. Total units were down 13% with Notebooks units down 8% and Desktops units down 13%.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  Effective at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2016, HP implemented an organizational change to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. In addition, HP implemented a reporting change to provide better transparency to its segment operating results. This reporting change resulted in the exclusion of certain market-related factors such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, and impacts from other market-related factors related to its defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans from its segment operating results (“Non-operating retirement-related credits”). This change also resulted in the exclusion of certain plan curtailments, settlements and special termination benefits related to its defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans from HP’s segment operating results. Segment operating results will continue to include service costs and amortization of prior service costs associated with HP’s defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The organizational and reporting changes had an immaterial impact to previously reported segment net revenue and earnings from operations. These changes also had no impact on HP’s previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share.

   Use of non-GAAP financial measures  

To supplement HP’s consolidated condensed financial statements presented on a generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis, HP provides net revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and gross cash. HP also provides forecasts of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations. 

These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are included in the tables above or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release.   

Use and economic substance of non-GAAP financial measures 

Net revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change in the foreign exchange rate from the prior-year period. Non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations is defined to exclude the effects of any charges relating to amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, defined benefit plan settlement charges and non-operating retirement-related credits. Non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations consist of net earnings from continuing operations or diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding those same charges. In addition, non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item and other tax benefits or charges as a consequence of the separation transaction. HP’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating HP’s historical and prospective financial performance, as well as HP’s performance relative to its competitors. HP’s management also uses these non-GAAP measures to further its own understanding of HP’s segment operating performance. HP believes that excluding the items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures allows HP’s management to better understand HP’s consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of HP’s segments, as HP’s management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. More specifically, HP’s management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons:    

   ● HP incurs charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets. Those charges are included in HP’s GAAP earnings from operations, operating margin, net earnings from continuing operations and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of HP’s acquisitions and any related impairment charges. Consequently, HP excludes these charges     

Page 14 of 17 

    for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of HP’s current operating performance and comparisons to HP’s operating performance in other periods.    

   ●  Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to (i) employee termination costs and benefits and (ii) costs to vacate duplicative facilities. HP excludes these restructuring costs (and any reversals of charges recorded in prior periods) for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures because it believes that these historical costs do not reflect expected future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of HP’s current operating performance or comparisons to HP’s operating performance in other periods.  

   ●  Non-operating retirement-related credits includes certain market-related factors such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, and impacts from other market-related factors associated with our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans. The market-driven retirement-related costs are primarily due to the changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and the company considers these costs to be outside the operational performance of the business. Non-operating retirement-related charges also include certain plan curtailments, settlements and special termination benefits related to HP’s defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans. HP believes that eliminating such costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of HP's current operating performance and provides better transparency into the segment operating results.  

   ●  HP incurred defined benefit plan settlement charges relating to U.S. HP pension plan. The charges are associated with the net settlement and remeasurement resulting from voluntary lump sum payments offered to certain terminated vested participants. HP excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of HP’s current operating performance and comparisons to HP’s operating performance in other periods.   

   ●  As part of separation, HP recorded several separation related items including: the reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance, the write-off of specific deferred taxes providing no continued benefit to HP and the entry of certain separation related deferred tax expense. HP believes that eliminating these amounts for purposes of calculating non-GAAP net earnings facilitates a more meaningful comparison of HP’s net    

Page 15 of 17 

     earnings to other periods, as HP’s management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results.   

Gross cash is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and certain long-term investments that may be liquidated within 90 days pursuant to the terms of existing put options or similar rights. HP's management uses gross cash for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in HP’s businesses, repurchasing stock and other purposes. HP’s management also uses gross cash to evaluate HP’s historical and prospective liquidity. Because gross cash includes liquid assets that are not included in GAAP cash and cash equivalents, HP believes that gross cash provides a helpful assessment of HP’s liquidity.  

Material limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures 

These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of HP’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are:    

   ● Items such as amortization of intangible assets, though not directly affecting HP’s cash position, represent the loss in value of intangible assets over time. The expense associated with this loss in value is not included in non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations, non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations or non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, and therefore does not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of those intangible assets.  

   ● Items such as restructuring charges, defined benefit plan settlement charges and non-operating retirement-related credits that are excluded from non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations, non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure and cash flows.  

   ●  HP may not be able to immediately liquidate the short-term and long-term investments included in gross cash, which may limit the usefulness of gross cash as a liquidity measure.   

   ● Other companies may calculate the non-GAAP financial measures differently than HP, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

Compensation for limitations associated with use of non-GAAP financial measures 

HP compensates for the limitations on its use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. HP also provides robust and detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure within this news release and in other written materials that include these non-GAAP financial measures, and HP encourages investors to review carefully those reconciliations. 

Usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures to investors 

HP believes that providing net revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations, non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations and gross cash to investors in addition to the related GAAP measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by HP’s management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see HP’s results “through the eyes” of management. HP further believes that providing this information better enables HP’s investors to understand HP’s operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by HP’s management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of HP’s operating performance with the performance of other companies in HP’s industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.
