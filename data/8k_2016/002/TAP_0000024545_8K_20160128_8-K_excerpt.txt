Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 

On January 28, 2016, Molson Coors Brewing Company (the “Company”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with UBS Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named in Schedule I thereto (collectively, the “Underwriters”), relating to an underwritten public offering (the “Offering”) of an aggregate of 29,884,393 shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Class B Common Stock”), which amount includes 2,716,763 shares of Class B Common Stock which may be sold pursuant to the exercise of an option by the Underwriters on the same terms and conditions as the Shares, which was exercised in full on January 29, 2016. The Shares were sold to the public at a price of $86.50 per share, and the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Shares from the Company pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement at a price of $84.5538 per share. After underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, the Company expects to receive net proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion from the Offering. The Underwriting Agreement contains representations by the Company and indemnification on certain matters in favor of the Underwriters. 

The Shares are being issued pursuant to an automatically effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 26, 2016 (File No. 333-209123). A prospectus supplement relating to the Offering has been filed with the SEC. The closing of the Offering is expected to occur on or about February 3, 2016. 

The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the full text of the document which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. 

The legal opinion and consent of Perkins Coie LLP relating to the issuance and sale of the Shares in the Offering is attached as Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
