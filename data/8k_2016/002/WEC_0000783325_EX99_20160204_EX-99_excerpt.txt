WEC Energy Group posts 2015 fourth quarter and full-year results

MILWAUKEE - WEC Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE: WEC) today recorded net income based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $179.3 million or 57 cents a share for the fourth quarter of 2015. WEC Energy Group was formed on June 29, 2015 when Wisconsin Energy completed the acquisition of Integrys.

Wisconsin Energy’s stand-alone earnings for the fourth quarter, excluding Integrys earnings and acquisition costs, rose to 63 cents a share. In the corresponding quarter a year ago, Wisconsin Energy’s stand-alone earnings, adjusted for acquisition costs, were 56 cents a share.

Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015 totaled $1.85 billion. Wisconsin Energy’s stand-alone fourth quarter revenue, which excludes $780 million of revenue from Integrys operations, was $1.07 billion. This compares with Wisconsin Energy revenue of $1.23 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.

“We delivered solid results in the final quarter of 2015 despite record warmth that limited customer demand for heating throughout December,” said Gale Klappa, chairman and chief executive.

Average daily temperatures in the fourth quarter were 26 percent warmer than during the fourth quarter of 2014.

For the full year 2015, WEC Energy Group reported net income based on generally accepted accounting principles of $638.5 million or $2.34 a share.

Wisconsin Energy’s stand-alone earnings for the full year 2015, excluding Integrys earnings and acquisition costs, increased to $2.73 a share. This compares to Wisconsin Energy’s stand-alone earnings, adjusted for acquisition costs, of $2.65 a share in 2014.

“Since the close of the acquisition, we’ve made significant progress in focusing our six operating utilities on world-class reliability, customer satisfaction, and financial discipline,” Klappa said.

“I’m very pleased with our execution and with our longer-term planning as we continue to deliver tangible benefits to our customers, to the communities we serve, and to the stockholders who count on us to create value,” Klappa added.

To facilitate comparison with 2014, the information on customer growth and electricity sales that follows reflects data for We Energies customers only.

At the end of 2015, We Energies was serving approximately 6,500 more electric customers and 8,500 more natural gas customers than a year ago. 

Residential use of electricity in 2015 declined by 2.0 percent. Consumption of electricity by small commercial and industrial customers was essentially level with the previous year. Electricity use by large commercial and industrial customers -- excluding the iron ore mines in Michigan's Upper Peninsula -- was down by 0.4 percent.

On a weather normal basis, retail sales of electricity -- excluding the iron ore mines -- were down by 0.8 percent as compared to 2014 levels.

“In summary, 2015 was another year of achievement for WEC Energy Group,” Klappa noted. “Our We Energies subsidiary was named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the fifth consecutive year -- extending our track record of network reliability and customer satisfaction.

“We completed the acquisition of Integrys in less than 53 weeks from the date of the announcement -- a major step that created the leading utility system in the Midwest, serving more than four million customers. And we delivered earnings and dividend growth that exceeded our projections,” he said.

Non-GAAP earnings measures

We have provided adjusted earnings (non-GAAP earnings) in this press release as a complement to, and not as an alternative to, reported earnings presented in accordance with GAAP. The adjusted stand-alone earnings of Wisconsin Energy exclude the results of operations of Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries and costs related to the acquisition of Integrys, as well as the additional WEC Energy Group shares of common stock that were issued as part of the acquisition. Costs related to the acquisition of Integrys are not indicative of the company’s operating performance.

Institutional investors have informed management on several occasions that, for 2015, they are interested in, and focused on, the performance of legacy Wisconsin Energy and subsidiaries, excluding the impact of the Integrys acquisition. In addition, the earnings guidance and performance expectations previously provided by the company were based upon legacy Wisconsin Energy’s operations. Therefore, we believe that the presentation of adjusted earnings is relevant and useful to investors. Management also used such measures internally to evaluate the company’s performance for 2015.
