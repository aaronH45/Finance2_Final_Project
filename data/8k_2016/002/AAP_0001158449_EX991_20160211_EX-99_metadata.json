        "(a) These financial measures for the twelve weeks ended January 2, 2016 have been reported on a GAAP basis which includes the impact of General Parts integration, store closure and consolidation and support center restructuring costs of $47.2 million and General Parts amortization of acquired intangible assets of $9.7 million. These financial measures for the thirteen weeks ended January 3, 2015 have been reported on a GAAP basis which includes the impact of a 53rd week of operations, General Parts integration and store consolidation costs of $36.7 million and General Parts amortization of acquired intangible assets of $9.9 million. These financial measures for the fiscal 2015 year ended January 2, 2016 have been reported on a GAAP basis which includes the impact of General Parts integration, store closure and consolidation costs and support center restructuring costs of $127.1 million and General Parts amortization of acquired intangible assets of $42.3 million. These financial measures for the fiscal 2014 year ended January 3, 2015 have been reported on a GAAP basis which includes the impact of a 53rd week of operations, General Parts integration and store consolidation costs of $82.2 million and General Parts amortization of acquired intangible assets of $42.7 million. These financial measures should be read in conjunction with our financial measures presented on a comparable basis earlier in this press release. Management believes the reporting of financial results on a non-GAAP basis to remain comparable is important in assessing the overall performance of our base business and is therefore useful for investors and prospective investors."
