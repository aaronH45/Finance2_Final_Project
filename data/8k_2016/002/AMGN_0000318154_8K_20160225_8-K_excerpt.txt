The Notes are registered under an effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-194103) (the “Registration Statement”), filed on February 24, 2014, and were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of May 22, 2014 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, and an officer’s certificate, dated as of February 25, 2016 (the “Officer’s Certificate”), setting forth the terms of the Notes. Net proceeds to the Company from the offering were approximately €1,987,529,554, after deducting underwriters’ discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.

The 2022 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 1.250% per annum, and the 2026 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 2.000% per annum, which, in each case, shall be payable annually in arrears on February 25 of each year, beginning on February 25, 2017. The 2022 Notes and the 2026 Notes will mature on February 25, 2022 and February 25, 2026, respectively.  

In the event of a change in control triggering event, as defined in the Officer’s Certificate attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
