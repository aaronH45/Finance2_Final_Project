FFO Per Share:  

The following table outlines the Company’s FFO and FFO as adjusted for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The table also provides a reconciliation to GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per diluted share for each period presented (amounts shown in thousands, except share and per share data — unaudited)1:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Per share amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.  

 (2) Adjustment to account for the difference between the number of shares used to calculate earnings per share and the number of shares used to calculate FFO per share. Earnings per share is calculated using the two-class method, which uses a lower number of shares than the calculation for FFO per share and FFO as adjusted per share, which are calculated assuming full redemption of all OP units as described in note (2).  

 (3) Extra Space Storage LP (the “Operating Partnership”) has outstanding preferred and common operating partnership units (“OP units”). These OP units can be redeemed for cash or, at the Company’s election, shares of the Company’s common stock. Redemption of all OP units for common stock has been assumed for purposes of calculating the weighted average number of shares — diluted as presented above. The computation of weighted average number of shares — diluted for FFO per share and FFO as adjusted per share also includes the effect of share-based compensation plans and shares related to the exchangeable senior notes using the treasury stock method.

Same-store revenues for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 increased due to gains in occupancy, higher rental rates for both new and existing customers and reduced customer discounts. Expenses were higher for the three months ended December 31, 2015 due to increases in tenant reinsurance expense, credit card merchant fees and property taxes. Increases in expenses were partially offset by decreases in utility expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2015.

Forward-looking statements include statements concerning the benefits of store acquisitions, favorable market conditions, our outlook and estimates for the year and other statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions and other information that is not historical information. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “anticipates,” or “intends,” or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy. We may also make additional forward-looking statements from time to time. All such subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, by us or on our behalf, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in or contemplated by this release. Any forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the risks referenced in the “Risk Factors” section included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Such factors include, but are not limited to:  

   •   adverse changes in general economic conditions, the real estate industry and the markets in which we operate;  

   •   failure to close pending acquisitions on expected terms, or at all;  

   •   the effect of competition from new and existing stores or other storage alternatives, which could cause rents and occupancy rates to decline;  

   •   difficulties in our ability to evaluate, finance, complete and integrate acquisitions and developments successfully and to lease up those stores, which could adversely affect our profitability;  

   •   potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination;  

   •   the impact of the regulatory environment as well as national, state and local laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those governing real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), tenant reinsurance and other aspects of our business, which could adversely affect our results;  

   •   disruptions in credit and financial markets and resulting difficulties in raising capital or obtaining credit at reasonable rates or at all, which could impede our ability to grow;  

   •   the failure to effectively manage our growth and expansion into new markets or to successfully operate acquired properties and operations;  

   •   increased interest rates and operating costs;  

   •   reductions in asset valuations and related impairment charges;  

   •   the failure of our joint venture partners to fulfill their obligations to us or their pursuit of actions that are inconsistent with our objectives;  

   •   the failure to maintain our REIT status for federal income tax purposes;  

   •   economic uncertainty due to the impact of war or terrorism, which could adversely affect our business plan; and  

   •   difficulties in our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and management members.  

All forward-looking statements are based upon our current expectations and various assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them, but there can be no assurance that management’s expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved. All forward-looking statements apply only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  

Definition of FFO:  

FFO provides relevant and meaningful information about the Company’s operating performance that is necessary, along with net income and cash flows, for an understanding of the Company’s operating results. The Company believes FFO is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings. Net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. The values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and the Company believes FFO more accurately reflects the value of the Company’s real estate assets. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (“NAREIT”) as net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. The Company believes that to further understand the Company’s performance, FFO should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with GAAP.  

For informational purposes, the Company also presents FFO as adjusted which excludes non-recurring revenues and expenses, acquisition related costs and non-cash interest. Although the Company’s calculation of FFO as adjusted differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, the Company believes it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance. The Company believes that by excluding non-recurring revenues and expenses, the costs related to acquiring stores and non-cash interest charges, stockholders and potential investors are presented with an indicator of its operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting FFO. FFO as adjusted by the Company should not be considered a replacement of the NAREIT definition of FFO. The computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company’s performance, as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an indicator of the Company’s ability to make cash distributions.  

Definition of Same-Store:  

The Company’s same-store pool for the periods presented consists of 503 stores that are wholly-owned and operated and that were stabilized by the first day of the earliest calendar year presented. The Company considers a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80.0% or more for one calendar year. Same-store results provide information relating to store operations without the effects of acquisitions or completed developments and should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of the Company’s stores as a whole.
