   Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.    

  On February 1, 2016, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2015 (the "Agreement"), by and between ConAgra Foods, Inc. (the "Company") and TreeHouse Foods, Inc. ("TreeHouse"), the Company completed its previously announced disposition of its private label operations (the "Business") to TreeHouse (the "Transaction") for $2.7 billion in cash on a cash-free, debt-free basis, subject to working capital and other adjustments. 

Concurrently with the closing of the Transaction, the Company and TreeHouse, and/or their respective affiliates, entered into a transition services agreement and certain other commercial arrangements.

The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 2, 2015, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

A copy of the Agreement has been incorporated by reference to provide investors and stockholders with information regarding its terms and is not intended to provide any factual information about the Company or TreeHouse or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Agreement have been made solely for the purposes of the Agreement and as of specific dates; were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Agreement; are not intended as statements of fact to be relied upon by the Company’s or TreeHouse’s investors or stockholders, but rather as a way of allocating contractual risk and governing the contractual rights and relationships between the parties to the Agreement; have been modified or qualified by certain confidential disclosures that were made between the parties in connection with the negotiation of the Agreement, which disclosures are not reflected in the Agreement itself; may no longer be true as of a given date; and may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by investors or stockholders. Investors and stockholders are not third party beneficiaries under the Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company, TreeHouse or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company’s or TreeHouse’s public disclosures. The Company acknowledges that, notwithstanding the inclusion of the foregoing cautionary statements, it is responsible for considering whether additional specific disclosures of material information regarding material contractual provisions are required to make the statements in this Form 8-K not misleading.

   Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.    

  On February 1, 2016, the Company issued a press release announcing that the Company had completed its sale of the Business, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference into this Item 7.01.

In accordance with General Instructions B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Item 7.01 and the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 are being furnished to the SEC in satisfaction of the public disclosure requirements of Regulation FD and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
