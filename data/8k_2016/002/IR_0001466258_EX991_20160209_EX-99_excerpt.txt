productivity actions and strong balance sheet - underpin how we have steadily delivered excellent organic growth, improved operating margins and average operating leverage above 35 percent over the past 5 years. And I am confident we will continue to add to our multi-year record of delivering excellent operating performance in 2016.” 

Additional Highlights from the 2015 Fourth Quarter

Revenues: The company’s organic revenues increased 3 percent (up 3 percent on a reported basis) to $3,326 million, compared with revenues of $3,241 million for the 2014 fourth quarter. Total U.S. organic revenues were up 4 percent compared to 2014, and organic revenues from international operations increased 2 percent.

Operating Margin: The fourth-quarter operating margin was 10.8 percent compared with 10.7 percent in 2014. Adjusted for restructuring charges, the operating margin for fourth-quarter 2015 was 11.3 percent, up 50 basis points on a comparable basis with 2014. Increased volume and productivity savings were partially offset by inflation and negative currency. 

Interest Expense and Other Income/Expense: Interest expense was $56 million for the fourth quarter. Other income totaled $5 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with $10 million for the 2014 fourth quarter primarily due to foreign exchange losses.

Taxes: Excluding restructuring, and one-time items, the company had an effective tax rate of approximately 22 percent for the fourth quarter of 2015. The comparable effective rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 25 percent. 

Fourth-Quarter Business Review

[Note: Adjusted segment margins for 2014 and 2015 exclude restructuring costs - see attached tables for additional details]

The Climate Segment delivers energy-efficient solutions globally and includes Trane® and American Standard® Heating and Air Conditioning which provide heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and commercial and residential building services, parts, support and controls; and Thermo King®, the leader in transport temperature control solutions. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $2,492 million, an organic increase of 5 percent (up 2 percent reported) compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. Organic bookings increased 5 percent (up 2 percent reported) year-over-year.

On a year-over-year basis, total commercial HVAC revenues increased by a low-single digit percentage and were up by a mid-single digit percentage excluding the impact of currency. Commercial HVAC organic revenues increased by a mid-single digit percentage in North America and were up low-teens in Asia. Organic revenues increased by a low-single digit percentage in both EMEA and South America compared with last year. Overall, currency had a negative 4 percentage point impact on fourth-quarter commercial HVAC results. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits despite a decline in industry shipments. 

Fourth-quarter 2015 commercial HVAC bookings were down slightly. Organic orders reflect a low-single digit increase compared with last year as high-single digit growth in North America orders was offset by declining activity in overseas markets. Residential HVAC orders showed strong improvement and increased by an upper-teens percentage.

Total Thermo King refrigerated transport organic revenues declined by low-single digits in the fourth quarter as gains in trailers and trucks were offset by a revenue decline in other businesses. Currency had a negative 5 percentage point impact on fourth-quarter reported revenues. Organic bookings increased by a low-single digit percentage in the fourth quarter of 2015, with gains in North America and Asia.

Fourth-quarter 2015 segment operating margin was 12.9 percent (excluding restructuring costs, adjusted operating margin was also 12.9 percent). The adjusted margin improved 70 basis points on a comparable basis with 2014 due to higher volumes and productivity gains, partially offset by inflation and negative currency impacts.

The Industrial Segment delivers products and services that enhance energy efficiency, productivity and operations. It includes Ingersoll Rand® compressed air systems and services, power tools and material handling systems, ARO® fluid management equipment, as well as Club Car® golf, utility and rough terrain vehicles. Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $834 million and increased 5 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. Organic revenues declined 2 percent and organic bookings declined 7 percent compared with last year.

Revenues for air compressors and industrial products were up mid-single digits overall and organic revenues declined low-single digits. Organic revenues were down high-single digits in the Americas; down low-single digits in EMEA and increased by high-single digits in Asia. Currency had a negative 6 percentage point impact on fourth-quarter revenue comparisons. Organic bookings declined by high-single digits compared with last year. 

Club Car revenues were flat compared with last year (increased slightly excluding currency) as growth in utility vehicles and aftermarket parts offset declines in the golf car market. 

Fourth-quarter segment operating margin was 12.7 percent (excluding restructuring costs, adjusted operating margin was 13.8 percent). Operating margins declined due to lower volumes, the first year inclusion of the Engineered Centrifugal Compressor acquisition-related amortization, negative currency and inflation, partially offset by productivity gains and positive price realization.

Balance Sheet and Free Cash Flow

At the end of the fourth quarter, working capital was 4.2 percent of revenues, compared with 3.1 percent in 2014. Cash balances and total debt balances were $0.7 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. Adjusted free cash flow for full-year 2015 was $985 million.

Share Repurchase 

During the fourth quarter, the company repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares for approximately $250 million as part of a $1.5 billion program approved by the board of directors in February 2014. Additionally, the company repurchased approximately 4.9 million shares for approximately $250 million during January 2016.

Sale of Hussmann Investment 

The company previously announced it will sell its remaining equity interest in Hussmann Parent, Inc. as part of a transaction in which Panasonic Corporation is acquiring 100 percent of Hussmann’s shares. Ingersoll Rand expects to receive net proceeds of approximately $425 million. The transaction is anticipated to close in the first half of 2016, subject to customary approvals and closing conditions. The 2016 EPS forecast excludes the gain from the sale of Hussmann. “Selling our remaining ownership in Hussmann provides immediate value to our shareholders and will provide additional cash for value-accretive deployment in 2016,” said Lamach. Ingersoll Rand completed the sale of a majority stake in the Hussmann business to private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC in September 2011. 

Completion of Agreement with the IRS

In December 2015, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation concluded its review and took no objection to our previously disclosed agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to resolve all open disputes related to intercompany debt through 2011. In connection with this agreement, the Company previously recognized a charge of approximately $227 million to income tax expense in the second quarter of 2015 and had a net cash outflow in the second half of 2015 of approximately $364 million, consisting of the $230 million in tax and $134 million of net interest.

Outlook

Based on a forecast of slow-to-moderate growth in global construction markets and weak industrial markets for 2016, the company expects organic revenues, which exclude currency, for full-year 2016 to increase in the range of 2 to 4 percent compared with 2015. Full-year reported revenues are forecasted to be in the range of flat to up 2 percent compared with 2015. Full-year adjusted EPS from continuing operations is

expected to be in the range of $3.80 to $4.00, with full-year reported continuing EPS expected to be $3.75 to $3.95, which includes EPS of $0.05 for restructuring. The full-year forecast reflects an average diluted share count of approximately 260 million shares. Adjusted free cash flow for full-year 2016 is expected to be in a range of $950 million to $1 billion.

First-quarter 2016 organic revenues are expected to increase in the range of 3 percent to 5 percent compared with 2015, with reported revenues expected to be in the range of flat to up 2 percent. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2016 are expected to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.38 with reported EPS of $0.28 to $0.33, which includes EPS of $0.05 for restructuring. The first-quarter forecast reflects an average diluted share count of approximately 265 million shares.
