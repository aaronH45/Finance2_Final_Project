Item 8.01 Other Events.  

As of January 6, 2016, all pending appeals of the Modified Third Amended Plan of Reorganization for Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (the “Amended Plan”) have been withdrawn. The Amended Plan was confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in May 2013. Under the terms of the Amended Plan, a trust will be established and all current and future personal injury claims against Corning Incorporated (“Corning”) relating to exposure to asbestos-containing products manufactured, distributed or sold by Pittsburgh Corning will be channeled to that trust for resolution. Corning anticipates that the Amended Plan will become effective and all conditions to funding of the trust will be satisfied in the first half of 2016.  

Corning and PPG Industries are each 50 percent shareholders of Pittsburgh Corning, which filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection in 2000.
