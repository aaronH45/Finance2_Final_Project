Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. 

Conversion Requests. Lennar Corporation (the “Company”) previously reported, on a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 21, 2015, that the Company had received conversion requests relating to $96.2 million aggregate principal amount of 2.75% convertible senior notes (“Notes”). The Company elected to settle the conversion requests using a combination of cash and Class A common stock. The number of shares of Class A common stock issuable pursuant to the conversion requests is based on the price of the shares during a 20 day observation period. As a result of the 20 day observation period having passed, the Company was able to determine the settlement amount for conversion requests, and the Company issued 2.2 million shares of Class A common stock and paid $96.2 million in cash, representing the face amount of the Notes.

Exchange Agreements. Since December 21, 2015, the Company has entered into privately negotiated agreements with holders of $19.1 million principal amount of Notes to exchange the Notes for $19.1 million in cash, which is comprised of the face value plus accrued interest on those Notes, and approximately 0.4 million shares of Class A common stock, which shares had a value equal to the amount by which the value of the shares that would be issuable upon conversion of the Notes exceeds their face amount. No commissions or other remuneration was paid or given for soliciting the redemptions.

The Notes were originally issued on November 10, 2010 and are currently convertible, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, into cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of both, at the Company’s election. Holders may convert the Notes at the conversion rate of 45.1794 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $22.13 per share of Class A common stock. The Company issued the Class A common stock on exchange or conversion of the Notes in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, contained in Section 3(a)(9) of that Act.
