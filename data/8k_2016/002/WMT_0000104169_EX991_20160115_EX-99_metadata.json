        "This release contains statements as to store closures, store openings, and the financial impact upon diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (EPS) from the store closures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the first half of fiscal 2017. Walmart believes such statements are 'forward-looking statements' as defined in, and they are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. The actual financial impact of the store closures may differ materially from the EPS estimates provided in the release as a result of changes in circumstances, assumptions not being realized or other risks, uncertainties and factors. The risks, uncertainties and factors include the risks relating to Walmart's operations and financial performance discussed in Walmart's most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). You should read this release in conjunction with that annual report on Form 10-K and Walmart's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K subsequently filed with the SEC. You should consider all of the risks, uncertainties and other factors identified in those SEC reports carefully when evaluating the forward-looking statements in this release. Walmart cannot assure you that the future results reflected in or implied by any such forward-looking statement will be realized or, even if substantially realized, will have the forecast or expected consequences and effects for or on Walmart's operations or financial performance. Such forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this release, and Walmart undertakes no obligation to update such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances."
