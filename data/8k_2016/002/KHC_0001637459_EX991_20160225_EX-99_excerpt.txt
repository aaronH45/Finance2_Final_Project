Q4 2015 Financial Summary

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1

Pro forma net sales were $7.1 billion, down 5.0 percent versus the year-ago period, primarily driven by a negative 6.1 percentage point impact from currency and a negative 0.5 percentage point impact from divestitures that was partially offset by a 4.7 percentage point benefit from a 53rd week of shipments. Pro Forma Organic Net Sales decreased 3.1 percent versus the year-ago period. Net pricing increased 0.7 percentage points reflecting gains from pricing in all segments that were partially offset by a negative impact of approximately 1.5 percentage points related to lower overall key commodity costs in the United States and Canada.(3) Volume/mix decreased 3.8 percentage points as strong growth in ketchup and sauces globally was more than offset by lower shipments in ready-to-drink beverages, frozen meals and coffee in the United States and Canada.

Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA increased 10.9 percent versus the year-ago period to $1.9 billion, despite a negative 9.4 percentage point impact from currency that was partially offset by a benefit of approximately 4.5 percentage points from a 53rd week of shipments. Excluding these factors, gains from cost savings initiatives(4) and favorable pricing net of commodity costs were partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix.

Adjusted Pro Forma EPS increased 10.7 percent versus the year-ago period to $0.62 from $0.56, including an approximate $0.03 benefit from a 53rd week of shipments. This increase primarily reflected the growth in Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA, partially offset by a higher tax rate compared to the prior year.

Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information (the “financial information”) presented in this release illustrates the estimated effects of the merger (the “2015 Merger”) consummated on July 2, 2015 of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (“Kraft”) with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (“Heinz”), the related equity investments and common stock conversion, the application of the acquisition method of accounting, and conformance of accounting policies. The financial information is presented as if the 2015 Merger had been consummated on December 30, 2013, the first business day of the Company’s 2014 fiscal year, and combines the historical results of Kraft and Heinz. For additional information on the 2015 Merger, please refer to the Company’s filings with the SEC.

The financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the completion of the acquisition. The Company utilized estimated fair values at the closing date of the 2015 Merger for the preliminary allocation of consideration to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Our purchase price allocation is substantially complete with the exception of identifiable intangible assets, certain income tax accounts and goodwill. During the measurement period, the Company will continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair value of net assets acquired, which may differ materially from these preliminary estimates.

The historical consolidated financial statements have been adjusted in the accompanying financial information to give effect to unaudited pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the 2015 Merger, (2) factually supportable and (3) expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of the combined company.

The financial information has been prepared based upon currently available information and assumptions deemed appropriate by management. This financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the Company’s results of operations actually would have been had the 2015 Merger been completed as of December 30, 2013. In addition, the financial information is not indicative of future results or current financial conditions and does not reflect any additional anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies, cost savings or any integration costs that may result from the 2015 Merger.

This financial information should be read in conjunction with historical financial statements and accompanying notes filed with the SEC. Certain reclassifications have been made to the historical Kraft and Heinz results to align accounting policies and eliminate intercompany sales in all periods presented.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement the financial information, the Company has presented Pro Forma Organic Net Sales, Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA and Adjusted Pro Forma EPS, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) that are provided.

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release may differ from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. Pro Forma Organic Net Sales, Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA and Adjusted Pro Forma EPS are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, operating income, diluted earnings per share (“EPS”), or other measures prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. 

The Company defines Pro Forma Organic Net Sales as pro forma net sales excluding the impact of currency, acquisitions, divestitures and the 53rd week of shipments when it occurs. The Company calculates the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year's exchange rate, with the exception of Venezuela following the Company's June 28, 2015 devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and remeasurement of assets and liabilities of its Venezuelan subsidiary, for which it calculates the previous year's results using the current year's exchange rate. Management believes that presenting Pro Forma Organic Net Sales is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items; (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance; and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company's results.

The Company defines Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA as pro forma operating income/(loss) excluding the impacts of depreciation and amortization (including amortization of postretirement benefit plan prior service credits), integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges, equity award compensation expense, impairment losses, gains/(losses) on the sale of a business and nonmonetary currency devaluation. The Company also presents Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA on a constant currency basis. The Company calculates the impact of currency on Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year's exchange rate, with the exception of Venezuela following the Company's June 28, 2015 devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and remeasurement of assets and liabilities of its Venezuelan subsidiary, for which it calculates the previous year's results using the current year's exchange rate. Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA is a tool intended to assist management in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect core operations.

The Company defines Adjusted Pro Forma EPS as pro forma diluted EPS excluding the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, gains/(losses) on the sale of a business, nonmonetary currency devaluation and the timing of preferred dividends. Management uses Adjusted Pro Forma EPS to assess operating performance on a consistent basis. 

See the attached schedules for supplemental financial data, which includes the financial information, the non-GAAP financial measures and corresponding reconciliations for the relevant periods.
