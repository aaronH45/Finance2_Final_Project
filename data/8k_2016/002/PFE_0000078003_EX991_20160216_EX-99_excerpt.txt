WYETH REACHES AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO RESOLVE MEDICAID DRUG REBATE CLAIMS FOR 2001-2006 PERIOD FOR PROTONIX

NEW YORK, N.Y., Tuesday, February 16, 2016 – Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) reported today that its Wyeth subsidiary has reached an agreement in principle to resolve claims alleging that Wyeth’s practices relating to the calculation of Medicaid rebates for its drug Protonix (pantoprazole sodium) between 2001 and 2006, several years before Pfizer acquired Wyeth in 2009, violated the Federal Civil False Claims Act and other laws. When finalized, the agreement in principle is expected to fully resolve cases pending in Federal District Court for the District of Massachusetts before the Honorable Douglas P. Woodlock.

Under the agreement in principle, Wyeth will make a payment of $784.6 million to resolve these claims. The agreement in principle does not include an admission of liability by Wyeth. The resolution is subject to the negotiation of final settlement agreements and court approval.

“We are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle to resolve these cases, which involve historic conduct that occurred at least 10 years ago, before Pfizer acquired Wyeth,” said Doug Lankler, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. “The resolution of these cases reflects a desire by the Company to put these cases behind us and to focus on the needs of patients.” 

As a result of the agreement in principle, Pfizer is reissuing its financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015, originally released on February 2, 2016, to reflect this $784.6 million charge recorded in Other (income)/deductions––net in the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and notes thereto. The Company’s Non-GAAP adjusted financial information for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015, which was issued on February 2, 2016, was not affected by the charge.

For additional details, see the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and notes thereto.

Those conditions included the inability to obtain significant conversions of Venezuelan bolivars related to intercompany U.S. dollar denominated accounts, an evaluation of the effects of the implementation of a fourth quarter 2015 operational restructuring, resulting in a 36% reduction in our labor force in Venezuela, and our expectation of the changes in Venezuela’s responses to changes in its economy.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Provision for taxes on income for fourth-quarter and full-year 2014 was favorably impacted by the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business, and the extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit which was signed into law in December 2014. The Provision for taxes on income for full-year 2014 was also favorably impacted by a decline in the non-tax deductible loss recorded in 2013 related to an option to acquire the remaining interest in Teuto since we expect to retain the investment indefinitely, the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. The Provision for taxes on income for full-year 2014 was unfavorably impacted by a
