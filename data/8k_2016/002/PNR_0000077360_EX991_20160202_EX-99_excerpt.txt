MANCHESTER, United Kingdom — February 2, 2016— Pentair plc (NYSE: PNR) today announced fourth quarter 2015 sales of $1.8 billion. Sales were down 2 percent compared to sales for the same period last year. Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency translation and positive contribution from acquisitions, core sales declined 4 percent in the fourth quarter. Adjusted fourth quarter 2015 earnings per diluted share from continuing operations (“EPS”) were $1.13, down 3 percent from adjusted EPS of $1.17 in the fourth quarter of last year. On a GAAP basis, excluding impairment charges, the company reported EPS of $0.51 compared to $0.70 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Amounts excluded from segment income, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are described in the attached schedules.

Fourth quarter 2015 segment income was $280 million, down 7 percent compared to segment income for fourth quarter 2014, and return on sales was 15.9 percent, a decrease of 90 basis points when compared to 2014 return on sales. On a GAAP basis, excluding impairment charges, the company reported operating income of $163 million for the quarter.

For the full year, the company reported sales of $6.4 billion, segment income of $1.0 billion, and adjusted EPS of $3.94. On a GAAP basis, excluding impairment charges, the company reported operating income of $732 million and EPS of $2.63.

Free cash flow was $316 million for the quarter and $643 million for the full year; which represented approximately 90 percent conversion of adjusted net income for the full year.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed step one of the goodwill impairment analysis required under U.S. GAAP. As a result, we determined the fair value of our Valves & Controls reporting unit was less than its carrying value. We are currently in the process of completing the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill of Valves & Controls. We will complete the necessary work to determine an estimated impairment amount prior to the issuance of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We estimate we will record a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $400 million - $600 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Pentair paid dividends of $0.32 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Pentair previously announced on December 8, 2015 that its Board of Directors approved a 5 percent increase in the company's regular annual cash dividend rate for 2016 to $1.34 from $1.28. 2016 will mark the 40th consecutive year that Pentair has increased its dividend.

“We delivered on our fourth quarter commitments despite the challenges our businesses serving the Energy and Industrial markets continue to face,” said Randall J. Hogan, Pentair Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We are maintaining our full year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.05 to $4.25 per share, which assumes continued difficult business conditions combined with additional productivity actions. We continue to believe in the long-term prospects of all of our businesses and we expect our proven track record around operational rigor and cash flow will help us manage our way through this uncertain economic environment.”
