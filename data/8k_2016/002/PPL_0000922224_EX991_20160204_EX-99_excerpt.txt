ALLENTOWN, Pa. (Feb. 4, 2016) – PPL Corporation (NYSE: PPL) on Thursday (2/4) announced 2015 reported earnings of $682 million, or $1.01 per share, compared with $1.74 billion, or $2.61 per share, in 2014. 

The company’s results for 2015 reflect the loss from discontinued operations of $921 million, or $1.36 per share, resulting primarily from the June 1 spinoff of its competitive supply business. 

Adjusting for special items, including results from the discontinued operations of the former Supply segment, earnings from ongoing operations were $1.49 billion, or $2.21 per share, compared with earnings from ongoing operations (adjusted) of $1.35 billion, or $2.03 per share in 2014, an increase of 9 percent on a per-share basis. 

The company’s results exceeded the midpoint of its 2015 earnings from ongoing operations forecast range of $2.15 to $2.25, marking the sixth consecutive year PPL has exceeded the midpoint of its earnings forecast. 

“2015 marked a pivotal year for PPL, one in which we again delivered strong results for our shareowners while laying a firm foundation for PPL’s continued growth and success,” said William H. Spence, PPL’s chairman, president and Chief Executive Officer. 

“We completed the successful spinoff of our Supply segment, capping our strategic transformation into a high-performing, purely regulated utility business,” Spence said. “We completed $3.5 billion in infrastructure improvements for our customers, secured approvals for recovery of additional utility investments in Pennsylvania and Kentucky rate cases, successfully transitioned to a new eight-year price-control period in the United Kingdom and reduced corporate support costs. 

“Looking forward, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver competitive earnings growth and dividend yields, all supported by a low-risk business plan,” Spence said. 

The company announced its 2016 earnings forecast range of $2.25 to $2.45 per share. In addition, Spence said PPL expects compound annual growth through 2018 of 5 to 6 percent above 2014 earnings of $2.03 per share from ongoing operations (adjusted). 

Earnings from PPL’s operations in the United States, including its corporate services organization, are expected to grow 11 to 13 percent through 2018, with 1 to 3 percent earnings growth expected in the United Kingdom. 

Backed by the continued strong performance and expected growth of its utilities, PPL announced that it is increasing its common stock dividend to $0.38 per share on a quarterly basis. The increased dividend will be payable April 1 to shareowners of record as of March 10. The increase, PPL’s 14th in 15 years, raises the annualized dividend from $1.51 per share to $1.52 per share. 

In closing out 2015, PPL reported fourth-quarter earnings of $399 million, or $0.59 per share, compared with reported earnings of $695 million, or $1.04 per share, in 2014. Adjusting for special items, fourth-quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $294 million, or $0.43 per share, compared with $330 million, or $0.49 per share, in 2014. 

2015 Earnings Details 

PPL’s reported earnings for 2015 included net special-item after-tax charges of $807 million, or $1.20 per share. 

Special items for 2015 included a loss from discontinued operations of $921 million, or $1.36 per share, resulting primarily from the June 1 spinoff of its competitive supply business, partially offset by a reduction in the U.K. corporate income tax rate and unrealized gains on foreign currency-related economic hedges. 

PPL’s reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015 included net special-item after-tax credits of $105 million, or $0.16 per share. 

Special items for the fourth quarter of 2015 included reductions to net deferred income tax liabilities resulting from a reduction in the U.K. corporate income tax rate and unrealized gains on foreign currency-related economic hedges. 

Reported earnings are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles). “Earnings from ongoing operations” is a non-GAAP financial measure that is adjusted for special items, including the Supply segment’s earnings and the loss from discontinued operations associated with the spinoff of the Supply segment. In addition, 2014 has been adjusted to reflect the impact of dissynergies related to the spinoff of the Supply segment. Special items and the dissynergies are fully detailed at the end of this news release.

Key Factors Impacting Earnings from Ongoing Operations 

U.K. Regulated Segment 

PPL’s U.K. Regulated segment primarily consists of the regulated electricity delivery operations of Western Power Distribution (WPD), serving Southwest and Central England and South Wales. 

Earnings from ongoing operations in 2015 increased by $0.07 per share compared with a year ago. This increase was primarily due to lower income taxes, lower depreciation expense and higher margins driven by an April 1, 2014 price increase, partially offset by lower prices driven by an April 1, 2015 price decrease due to the beginning of the new eight-year price control period (RIIO-ED1). 

Earnings from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter of 2015 decreased by $0.07 per share compared with a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to lower margins primarily driven by an April 1, 2015 price decrease due to the commencement of RIIO-ED1 and higher operation and maintenance expense, partially offset by lower U.K. income taxes due to a change in tax rates and lower depreciation expense. 

Kentucky Regulated Segment 

PPL’s Kentucky Regulated segment primarily consists of the regulated electricity and natural gas operations of Louisville Gas and Electric Company and the regulated electricity operations of Kentucky Utilities Company. 

Earnings from ongoing operations in 2015 increased by $0.04 per share compared with a year ago. This was primarily due to higher base electricity rates effective July 1, 2015, and higher returns on additional environmental capital investments, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to unfavorable weather in the fourth quarter, and higher operation and maintenance expense, including costs associated with the retirement of coal-fired generation at the Cane Run facility, and higher financing costs related to the 2015 debt issuances. 

Earnings from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter of 2015 decreased by $0.01 per share compared with a year ago. This was primarily due to lower sales volumes due to unfavorable weather and higher financing costs, partially offset by higher base electricity rates effective July 1, 2015, and higher returns on additional environmental capital investments.  

Pennsylvania Regulated Segment 

PPL’s Pennsylvania Regulated segment consists of the regulated electricity delivery operations of PPL Electric Utilities. 

Earnings from ongoing operations in 2015 decreased by $0.03 per share compared with a year ago, driven primarily by higher operation and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by higher transmission and distribution margins and the release of a gross receipts tax reserve. 

Earnings from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter of 2015 decreased by $0.01 per share compared with a year ago.

Corporate and Other 

PPL’s Corporate and Other category primarily includes unallocated corporate-level financing and other costs. Corporate and Other in 2015 improved by $0.10 per share compared with a year ago (adjusted) and $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter compared with the previous year. This was primarily due to the benefits of the corporate restructuring.  

Forecast of Earnings from Ongoing Operations

(See the tables at the end of this news release for a reconciliation of reported earnings to 2015 earnings from ongoing operations.) 

The midpoint of PPL’s 2016 earnings forecast of $2.35 per share represents an increase of more than 6 percent compared to 2015 earnings from ongoing operations. This increase is primarily attributable to increases in the Pennsylvania Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segments. 

U.K. Regulated Segment   

PPL projects relatively flat segment earnings in 2016 compared with 2015, due to higher financing costs, depreciation expense, currency, taxes and other expenses, partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expense, including pension expense, and higher gross margins.  

The 2016 foreign currency exposure for this segment is 95 percent hedged at an average rate of $1.56 per pound. 

Kentucky Regulated Segment  

PPL projects higher segment earnings in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily driven by electric and gas base rate increases effective July 1, 2015, and higher returns on additional environmental capital investments, partially offset by higher depreciation expense and higher financing costs. 

Pennsylvania Regulated Segment  

PPL projects higher segment earnings in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily driven by a distribution base rate increase effective Jan. 1, 2016, and higher transmission margins, partially offset by higher depreciation, higher financing costs and a benefit received in 2015 from the release of a gross receipts tax reserve. 

Corporate and Other

“Earnings from ongoing operations,” should not be considered as an alternative to reported earnings, or net income, which is an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). PPL believes that earnings from ongoing operations, although a non-GAAP financial measure, is also useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management’s view of PPL’s earnings excluding the Supply segment, as the spinoff was completed June 1, 2015. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance. Earnings from ongoing operations is adjusted for the impact of special items as described below, which includes the Supply segment’s earnings now reflected in discontinued operations. Also included in special items is the loss on spinoff resulting from the fair value of the Supply segment being less than PPL’s recorded value as of June 1, 2015, the date of the spinoff. “Earnings from ongoing operations (adjusted)” for 2014 also reflects, within the Corporate and Other category, the impact of spinoff dissynergies that would remain with PPL after the completion of the transaction, if left unmitigated.  

“Earnings from ongoing operations” is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items include:  

 •Unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency-related economic hedges. 

 •Supply segment discontinued operations. 

 •Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business. 

 •Impairment charges.  

 •Workforce reduction and other restructuring effects. 

 •Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments. 

 •Other charges or credits that are, in management’s view, not reflective of the company’s ongoing operations.
