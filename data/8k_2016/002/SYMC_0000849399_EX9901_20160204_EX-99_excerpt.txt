USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION: Our results of operations have undergone significant change due to the impact of litigation accruals, discontinued operations, stock-based compensation, restructuring, transition, and separation matters, charges related to the amortization of intangible assets, and certain other income and expense items that management considers unrelated to Symantec’s core operations. To help our readers understand our past financial performance and our future results, we supplement the financial results that we provide in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures. The method we use to produce non-GAAP results is not computed according to GAAP and may differ from the methods used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Symantec’s operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results, which is attached to our quarterly earnings release and which can be found, along with other financial information, on the investor relations page of our website at: http://www.symantec.com/invest.

Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures 

Appendix A 

Objective of non-GAAP measures: We believe our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s operating performance for the reasons discussed below. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company’s operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of the Company’s performance to prior periods and to our peers and that investors benefit from an understanding of the non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. 

Discontinued operations: In January 2016, the Company and Carlyle amended the terms of the purchase agreement for Carlyle's acquisition of the information management business, Veritas. Based on the amended terms, the Company will receive net consideration of $6.6 billion in cash and 40 million B common shares of Veritas. The transaction closed on January 29, 2016. The results of Veritas are presented as discontinued operations in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for all reported periods. Furthermore, the related assets and liabilities have been classified as held for sale on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The gain on sale will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016, to the extent that the net proceeds from the final sale amount exceed the book carrying value of the assets sold. 

Unallocated corporate charges: A significant portion of the segments' expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources. These expenses, collectively called corporate charges, include legal, accounting, real estate, information technology services, treasury, human resources and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Charges were allocated to the segments, and the allocations were determined on a basis that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the segments. Corporate charges previously allocated to our information management business, but not classified within discontinued operations, were not reallocated to our other segments. We eliminate these unallocated corporate charges from our non-GAAP operating results to facilitate a more meaningful comparison of past operating performance to current operating results. 

Stock-based compensation: Consists of expenses for employee stock options, restricted stock units, performance based awards and our employee stock purchase plan determined in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock-based compensation. When evaluating the performance of our individual business units and developing short- and long-term plans, we do not consider stock-based compensation charges. Our management team is held accountable for cash-based compensation, but we believe that management is limited in its ability to project the impact of stock-based compensation and accordingly is not held accountable for its impact on our operating results. In addition, for comparability purposes, we believe it is useful to provide a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate the comparison of our results to the results of our peer companies. Furthermore, unlike cash-based compensation, the value of stock-based compensation is determined using complex formulas that incorporate factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond our control. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Amortization of intangible assets: When conducting internal development of intangible assets, accounting rules require that we expense the costs as incurred. In the case of acquired businesses, however, we are required to allocate a portion of the purchase price to the accounting value assigned to intangible assets acquired and amortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets. The acquired company, in most cases, has itself previously expensed the costs incurred to develop the acquired intangible assets, and the purchase price allocated to these assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost we would incur in developing the intangible asset. We eliminate these amortization charges from our non-GAAP operating results to provide better comparability of pre- and post-acquisition operating results and comparability to results of businesses utilizing internally developed intangible assets. 

Income tax effects and adjustments: During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company adopted a projected long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 27.5% in order to provide better consistency across the interim financial reporting periods by eliminating the effects of stock based compensation, amortization of acquisition related intangibles and restructuring, separation and transition charges. Additionally, the use of a long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate will eliminate the effects of certain discontinued operations accounting policy elections and unique GAAP reporting requirements under discontinued operations as a result of the sale of the information management business. This long-term rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, such as significant changes in the geographic earnings mix including acquisition activity, or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where the company operates. The Company will evaluate and assess the appropriateness of this rate annually, giving due consideration to the impacts of significant events and structural changes in the Company. 

Restructuring, separation, and transition: We have engaged in various restructuring, separation, and transition activities over the past several years that have resulted in costs associated with severance, facilities, transition, and other related costs. Separation and other related costs consist of consulting and disentanglement costs incurred to separate our security and information management businesses into standalone companies, as well as costs to prune selected product lines that do not fit either the Company’s growth or margin objectives. Transition and other related costs consist of consulting charges associated with the implementation of new Enterprise Resource Planning systems. Each restructuring, separation, and transition activity has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. We do not engage in restructuring, separation, or transition activities in the ordinary course of business. While our operations previously benefited from the employees and facilities covered by our various restructuring and separation charges, these employees and facilities have benefited different parts of our business in different ways, and the amount of these charges has varied significantly from period to period. We believe that it is important to understand these charges and we believe that investors benefit from excluding these charges from our operating results to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of current operating performance and comparisons to past operating performance.
