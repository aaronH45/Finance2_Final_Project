RECONCILIATION OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP INFORMATION

(Unaudited)

The company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, management believes that certain non-GAAP measures that reflect the way management evaluates the business may provide investors with additional information regarding the company's results, trends and ongoing performance on a comparable basis. Specifically, investors should consider the following with respect to our quarterly results:

Net sales and Segment Operating Profit, as adjusted to currency neutral: Net sales and Segment Operating Profit are calculated on a currency neutral basis by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior-period foreign currency exchange rates. Beginning in the second quarter of 2015, we excluded the impact of realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions from our currency neutral calculation.

Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for capital spending and certain items excluded for comparison to prior year periods. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no such items excluded for comparison to prior year periods.

Core Earnings: Core earnings is defined as net income adjusted for the unrealized mark-to-market impact of commodity derivatives and certain items that are excluded for comparison to prior year periods. The certain item excluded for the three months ended December 31, 2015, is a non-cash brand impairment charge for Garden Cocktail. The certain items excluded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, are (i) a non-cash brand impairment charge for Garden Cocktail and (ii) an adjustment to a previously disclosed legal provision. The certain items excluded for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014, are (i) separation-related charges, (ii) an adjustment to a previously disclosed legal provision and (iii) a settlement charge related to the purchase of annuities for certain participants receiving benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans.

Currency Neutral Core: Core earnings are calculated on a currency neutral basis by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior-period foreign currency exchange rates.
