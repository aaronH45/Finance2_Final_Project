Unum Group Reports Fourth Quarter 2015 Results

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (February 2, 2016) - Unum Group (NYSE: UNM) today reported net income of $226.1 million ($0.93 per common share) for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to a net loss of $282.2 million ($1.12 per common share) for the fourth quarter of 2014. 

After-tax operating income, which excludes after-tax realized investment gains and losses on the Company’s investment portfolio, the amortization of prior period actuarial losses on the Company’s pension plans, and certain other specified items for 2014, was $230.6 million ($0.95 per common share) in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $225.7 million ($0.89 per common share) in the fourth quarter of 2014. The combined impact of the amounts excluded for the fourth quarter of 2015 resulted in a net after-tax loss of $4.5 million ($0.02 per common share). The combined impact of the amounts excluded for the fourth quarter of 2014 resulted in a net after-tax loss of $507.9 million ($2.01 per common share) and include a reserve charge in the long-term care closed block, a net realized investment loss, the amortization of prior period actuarial losses on the Company’s pension plans, and a settlement loss from a pension plan amendment.

“Our fourth quarter results were strong, capping off a very good year for our Company. 2015 was a year where we experienced favorable growth trends in our core business lines and stable benefits experience, which combine to drive strong profitability and capital generation,” said Richard P. McKenney, president and chief executive officer. “As we move into 2016 we remain strategically well-positioned in our markets with strong operating performance trends and excellent financial flexibility, despite the on-going macro-environment challenges.”

Premium income in group disability increased 5.5 percent to $570.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $540.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to favorable persistency in the group long-term disability product line, prior period sales growth, and premium rate increases. Net investment income declined by 5.7 percent to $124.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $132.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a decrease in the level of invested assets supporting this line of business, a decline in yields, and a lower level of miscellaneous investment income. The benefit ratio for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 81.7 percent, compared to 83.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting lower new claim incidence levels and higher claim recoveries in the group long-term disability line, as well as favorable benefits experience in the group short-term disability line. Group long-term disability sales were $116.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $116.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.

The group life and accidental death and dismemberment line of business reported operating income of $54.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decline of 8.4 percent from $59.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting less favorable benefits experience, which offset an increase in premium income. Premium income for this line of business increased 5.2 percent to $373.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $355.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to prior period sales growth, partially offset by a decline in persistency. Net investment income declined 2.9 percent to $33.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $34.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a decline in yields, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets supporting this line of business. The benefit ratio in the

Net investment income increased to $62.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $57.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, due to an increase in the level of invested assets and higher miscellaneous investment income, partially offset by a decline in yields. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the individual disability product line was 33.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 30.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2014.

In local currency, net investment income declined 6.1 percent to £22.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to £24.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to lower income from inflation index-linked bonds. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 69.9 percent, compared to 68.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting higher new claims in the group long-term disability and group life lines, partially offset by higher claim recoveries in the group long-term disability line.

Premium income for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 5.1 percent to $337.4 million, compared to $321.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by sales growth in recent quarters, partially offset by a decline in persistency. Net investment income declined by 5.3 percent to $35.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $37.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a lower level of miscellaneous investment income. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 51.2 percent, compared to 52.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting favorable experience in the accident, sickness, and disability product line. 

Sales increased 5.1 percent to $169.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 from $161.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, with favorable sales trends in both the commercial and public sector market segments.

The Closed Block segment reported operating income of $28.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to an operating loss of $668.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding the before-tax reserve charge of $698.2 million for the closed block of long-term care, the Closed Block segment reported operating income of $29.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. 

Premium income for this segment declined 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to expected policy terminations and maturities for the individual disability line of business and a slight decline in premium income for the long-term care line of business. Net investment income increased 5.4 percent to $340.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $323.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, due to an increase in the level of invested assets and higher miscellaneous investment income, partially offset by a decrease in yield. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the individual disability line of business increased to 87.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to 81.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, due primarily to a slight reduction in the claim reserve discount rate which offset generally stable new claim incidence and claim recovery rates. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the long-term care line of business was 89.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 89.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, with generally stable new claim incidence and claim recovery rates.

Corporate Segment 

The Corporate segment reported an operating loss of $34.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to an operating loss of $24.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures of "operating revenue," "before-tax operating income" or "before-tax operating loss," and "after-tax operating income" differ from total revenue, income before income tax, and net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses, non-operating retirement-related gains or losses, and certain other items as specified in the reconciliations in the Financial Highlights section below. We believe operating revenue and operating income or loss are better performance measures and better indicators of the revenue and profitability and underlying trends in our business. 

Realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments. Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as 

UNUM IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK AND MARKETING BRAND OF UNUM GROUP AND ITS INSURING SUBSIDIARIES. 5

opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses. Although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities. 

The amortization of prior period actuarial gains or losses, a component of the net periodic benefit cost for our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans, is driven by market performance as well as plan amendments and is not indicative of the operational results of our businesses. We believe that excluding the amortization of prior period gains or losses, as well as the 2014 settlement loss from our pension plan amendment, from operating income or loss provides investors with additional information for comparison and analysis of our operating results. Although we manage our non-operating retirement-related gains or losses separately from the operational performance of our business, these gains or losses impact the overall profitability of our company and have historically increased or decreased over time, depending on plan amendments and market conditions and the resulting impact on the actuarial gains or losses in our pensions and other postretirement benefit plans. 

We believe that excluding the 2014 costs related to the early retirement of debt is appropriate because in conjunction with the debt redemption, we recognized in realized investment gains and losses a deferred gain from previously terminated derivatives which were associated with the hedge of this debt. The amount recognized as a realized investment gain, which basically offsets the cost of the debt redemption, is also excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures since we analyze our performance excluding amounts reported as realized investment gains or losses. We believe it provides investors with a more realistic view of our overall profitability if we are consistent in excluding both the cost of the retirement as well as the gain on the hedge of the debt. 

We may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability.
