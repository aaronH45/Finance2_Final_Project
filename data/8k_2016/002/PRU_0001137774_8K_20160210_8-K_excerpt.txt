 Item 8.01 Other Events.  

In February 2016, we self-reported to the SEC, and notified other regulators, that in some cases we failed to maximize securities lending income due to a long-standing restriction benefitting the Company that limited the availability of loanable securities for certain separate account investments. We have removed the restriction and intend to implement a remediation plan for the benefit of customers. We intend to fully cooperate with regulators in this matter.
