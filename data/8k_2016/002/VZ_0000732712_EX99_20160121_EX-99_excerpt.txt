NEW YORK – Capping a year of transformational change, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) today reported fourth-quarter 2015 earnings of $1.32 per share, or 89 cents per share on an adjusted basis (non-GAAP).  

“In 2015, Verizon delivered strong and balanced results in a dynamic competitive environment while returning more than $13.5 billion to shareholders. At the same time, Verizon built and acquired next-generation network capabilities that position the company to be an innovator in the digital-first mobile world in 2016 and beyond,” said Chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam.  

Fourth-quarter 2015 EPS results compare with a loss of 54 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2014. Earnings were impacted by non-operational items in both quarters, primarily related to the annual actuarial valuation of benefit plans and mark-to-market pension adjustments (see details below). Verizon’s adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) of 89 cents in fourth-quarter 2015 increased 25.4 percent compared with adjusted EPS of 71 cents in fourth-quarter 2014.  

For the full year, Verizon reported $4.37 in EPS in 2015, compared with $2.42 in EPS in 2014. On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), Verizon’s $3.99 in EPS in 2015 was an increase of 19.1 percent compared with $3.35 in adjusted EPS in 2014.  

In 2015, Verizon invested approximately $28 billion in spectrum licenses and capital for future network capacity, in addition to the more than $4 billion acquisition of AOL Inc. in June. Over that same time, the company reduced its leverage ratio and returned more than $13.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Verizon’s Board of Directors increased the dividend for the ninth consecutive year in September.  

Acquisitions of AOL and Millennial Media added capabilities that significantly bolster Verizon’s strategy with strong cross-platform consumer and advertising offerings, particularly in mobile and video. In 2015, the company launched the go90tm mobile-first social entertainment platform, Custom TV options for Fios customers, the humtm direct-to-consumer telematics product, and the Thingspace suite of developer tools to advance the Internet of Things market. Verizon’s investments have also positioned the company to lead in the deployment of 5G wireless broadband.  

“Verizon embraced transformational change in 2015, and in 2016 the company has a huge opportunity to drive a new era of growth in our industry,” McAdam said.  

Consolidated results  

   •    Total operating revenues in fourth-quarter 2015 were $34.3 billion, a 3.2 percent increase compared with fourth-quarter 2014. For the full year, Verizon reported total consolidated revenues of $131.6 billion. Full-year 2015 revenues grew 3.6 percent, compared with full-year 2014.

Details of non-operational earnings impacts  

Verizon’s fourth-quarter 2015 earnings of $1.32 per share included a year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits liabilities. A pre-tax $3.2 billion credit decreased the company’s pension and OPEB liability. This adjustment, which was primarily non-cash, was caused by an increase in the discount rate, the adoption of new mortality assumption tables and the execution of a new prescription drug contract during 2015. The company also incurred pre-tax expenses primarily related to severance costs. On an after-tax basis, these items amounted to a net of $1.6 billion, or a gain of 40 cents per share.  

Additionally, Verizon recognized an after-tax gain of $158 million, or 4 cents per share, on a spectrum license transaction.  

Excluding the effect of these non-operational gains, Verizon’s adjusted EPS of 89 cents in fourth-quarter 2015 compared with 71 cents in fourth-quarter 2014, when charges totaled $1.25 per share. Fourth-quarter 2014 results included a negative year-end mark-to-market pension and OPEB adjustment, plus severance costs, of $1.12 per share, in addition to 13 cents per share primarily related to the early retirement of debt.  

In February 2014 Verizon completed the acquisition of Vodafone Group PLC’s indirect 45 percent interest in Verizon Wireless. On a non-GAAP illustrative basis, assuming Verizon had 100 percent ownership for Verizon Wireless all of 2014, Verizon’s adjusted earnings per share growth rate on a more comparable basis was 16.7 percent, comparing 2015 with 2014.  

2016 outlook  

Verizon, on a consolidated basis, expects to mitigate 2016 earnings pressures resulting from the sale of high-margin wireline operations to Frontier Communications Corp. (expected to close at the end of  

Page 5  

 the first quarter), from the continued shift of the wireless customer base to device payment plans and from the ramping of new business models. As previously stated, Verizon expects full-year 2016 adjusted earnings to plateau at a level comparable to its strong full-year 2015 adjusted earnings. Additionally, for 2016, the company expects:  

   •    Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full-year 2015.  

   •    Consolidated capital spending of between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion. This includes approximately $150 million for the properties to be sold to Frontier.  

   •    A minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million.  

   •    An effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes in the range of 35 to 36 percent.  

   •    The use of Frontier proceeds to pay down debt, as the company remains committed to returning to its pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.
