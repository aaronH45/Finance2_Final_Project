        "(5) Other revenues are comprised primarily of alliance revenue, third-party manufacturing sales and miscellaneous corporate revenues, including revenue hedging activities. On June 30, 2014, AstraZeneca exercised its option to buy Merck’s interest in a subsidiary and through it, Merck’s interest in Nexium and Prilosec. As a result, the company no longer records supply sales for these products. Other revenues in the first quarter 2014 include $232 million of revenue recognized in connection with the sale of U.S. Saphris rights."
