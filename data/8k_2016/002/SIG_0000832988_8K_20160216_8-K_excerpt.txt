   Item 8.01 Other Events.    

  Signet Jewelers Limited’s ("Signet’s") Common Shares is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and the London Stock Exchange ("LSE"). Signet has today filed a voluntary application with the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority to delist its Common Shares from the LSE.

Signet took this action because less than 1% of its annual trading volume is executed on the LSE. As a result, the benefit of LSE listing is outweighed by the monetary expense, regulatory burdens, and time spent on LSE-driven activity.

Shares will continue to be traded on the LSE until close of business on March 14, 2016 and cancellation from trading will take effect from 08.00 GMT on March 15, 2016.

Signet will continue to have its Common Shares listed on the NYSE.
