Outlook 

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company expects total revenue to be in the range of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion, which includes approximately $36 million of additional sales due to the 53rd week. On a constant currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the high-single digit range assuming an impact of approximately $20 million from the change in foreign currency rates. The Company expects comparable store sales to be flat on a reported basis and to increase in the low single digits on a constant currency basis. Operating expense as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase 190 to 220 basis points, primarily due to global investments in digital flagships, corporate talent, new stores, shop-in-shops, infrastructure and distribution. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.93 to $0.97 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. This assumes 182.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding and a tax rate of approximately 27.5%. The Company expects foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $3 million and EPS by approximately $0.02.

For fiscal 2016, the Company expects total revenue to be approximately $4.65 billion. On a constant currency basis, total revenue is expected to increase in the low-double digit range assuming an impact of approximately $180 million from the change in foreign currency rates. The Company expects a mid-single digit comparable store sales decrease on a reported basis and a low-single digit decrease on a constant currency basis. Operating expense as a percentage of total revenue is expected to increase approximately 230 basis points, due to the above mentioned investments. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.42 for fiscal 2016. This assumes 190 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding and a tax rate of approximately 28.5%. The Company expects foreign currency to impact net income by approximately $38 million and EPS by approximately $0.20.

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Financial Measures

Constant currency effects are non-GAAP financial measures, which are provided to supplement our reported operating results to facilitate comparisons of our operating results and trends in our business, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Because we are a global Company, foreign currency exchange rates may have a significant effect on our reported results. We calculate constant currency measures and the related foreign currency impacts by translating the current-year’s reported amounts into comparable amounts using prior year’s foreign exchange rates for each currency. All constant currency performance measures discussed below should be considered a supplement to and not in lieu of our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP.”)
