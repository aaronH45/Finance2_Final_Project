ST. LOUIS (Feb. 19, 2016) — Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced 2015 net income attributable to common shareholders in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $630 million, or $2.59 per diluted share, compared to $586 million, or $2.40 per diluted share, for 2014. Excluding certain items discussed below, Ameren recorded core earnings of $622 million, or $2.56 per diluted share, for 2015, compared to core earnings of $587 million, or $2.40 per diluted share, for 2014.

The year-over-year increase in 2015 core earnings reflected increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure made under modern, constructive regulatory frameworks as well as the absence, in 2015, of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center, which is scheduled to occur every 18 months. The positive effects of these factors were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expenses and lower retail electric and gas sales volumes in 2015 driven by milder winter temperatures. 

"We delivered strong earnings growth in 2015," said Warner L. Baxter, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. “Despite some challenges, including very mild fourth quarter weather, we were able to achieve this growth through the continued execution of our strategy, which includes allocating capital to jurisdictions with modern, constructive regulatory frameworks and managing costs in a disciplined manner."

Ameren recorded GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2015, of $29 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, compared to $48 million, or 20 cents per diluted share, for the same period in 2014. Excluding results from discontinued operations discussed below, Ameren recorded core earnings of $30 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2015, compared to $46 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, for the same period in 2014.

This year-over-year decrease in fourth quarter 2015 core earnings reflected lower retail electric and gas sales volumes primarily driven by milder winter temperatures, a higher effective income tax rate and the absence of a fourth quarter 2014 benefit resulting from a regulatory order regarding debt redemption costs. The negative effects of these factors were partially offset by the absence, in 2015, of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center and earnings on increased investments in electric transmission infrastructure. 

The following items were excluded from core earnings for the three months and year ended Dec. 31, 2015 and 2014, as applicable:

•Results from discontinued operations, primarily reflecting recognition of a tax benefit related to the resolution of an uncertain tax position, which increased 2015 GAAP net income by $52 million.

•A provision for discontinuing pursuit of a construction and operating license (COL) for a second nuclear unit at Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center, which decreased 2015 net income from continuing operations by $43 million.

A reconciliation of GAAP to core earnings per diluted share is as follows:

Earnings Guidance

Ameren expects 2016 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.60 including an estimated 13 cents per share reduction related to significantly lower expected electric sales volumes to Noranda Aluminum, Inc. (Noranda), Ameren Missouri's largest customer. Ameren also expects diluted earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 through 2020, excluding the expected temporary net effect of lower sales to Noranda in 2016. These increasing earnings are expected to be driven by projected rate base growth of approximately 6.5% compounded annually from 2015 through 2020.

"Looking ahead, we expect to continue to deliver strong long-term earnings per share growth compared to our peers as we execute our strategy," Baxter said. "In addition, we will continue to work constructively with key stakeholders to modernize Missouri’s regulatory framework to better support investment in that state’s aging energy infrastructure for the long-term benefit of our customers and the state of Missouri." 

Earnings guidance for 2016 assumes normal temperatures, and along with Ameren's growth expectations, is subject to the effects of, among other things: 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields; regulatory decisions and legislative actions; energy center and energy delivery operations; Noranda sales levels; energy, economic, capital and credit market conditions; severe storms; unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses; and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release.

Ameren Missouri Segment Results

Ameren Missouri segment 2015 GAAP and core earnings were $352 million and $395 million, respectively, compared to 2014 GAAP and core earnings of $390 million. The difference between 2015 GAAP and core earnings reflected the provision for the Callaway COL described previously. The core earnings increase reflected the absence, in 2015, of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center. This benefit was partially offset by lower capitalized financing costs and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. The comparison was also negatively affected by lower retail electric sales volumes in 2015 driven by milder winter temperatures. 

Ameren Illinois Segment Results

Ameren Illinois segment 2015 earnings were $214 million, compared to 2014 earnings of $201 million. This comparison benefited from earnings on increased investments in electric transmission and delivery infrastructure and an Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) order approving recovery of cumulative power usage costs. These positive factors were partially offset by a reduced allowed return on equity for the electric delivery business due to lower 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields, higher depreciation and amortization expenses related to natural gas delivery service and the absence of a 2014 benefit resulting from an ICC order regarding debt redemption costs. The comparison was also negatively affected by lower retail electric and gas sales volumes in 2015 driven by milder winter temperatures. 

Other Results from Continuing Operations, including ATXI and Parent

Other earnings, including those of Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois (ATXI) and the parent company, for 2015 were $14 million, compared to a loss of $4 million for 2014. These improvements reflected an increase in earnings at ATXI to $31 million from $14 million as a result of increased investments in electric transmission infrastructure.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In this release, Ameren has presented core earnings, which is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results has been included in this release. Generally, core earnings (or losses) include earnings or losses attributable to common stockholders and exclude income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as the Callaway COL provision. Ameren uses core earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core earnings as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the company believes that core earnings allow the company to more accurately compare its ongoing performance across periods. In providing core earnings guidance, there could be differences between core earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP as a result of our treatment of certain items, such as those described above. Ameren is unable to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of such items.

Given these uncertainties, undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements. Except to the extent required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements to reflect new information or future events.
