PEER-LEADING EXPENSE CONTROL 5 (1) For Aimco and peers, results include all property operating costs, which is comprised of COE, taxes, insurance and utilities. Peer group consists of AvalonBay, Camden, Equity Residential, Essex, MAA, Post Properties and UDR. Data Sources: SNL Financial, company reports. (2) Controllable Property Operating Expenses (“COE”) represent property operating expenses before taxes, insurance and utilities. • Focus on efficient operations: Over the past seven years, the compound annual growth rate for Aimco’s property operating expenses before taxes, insurance, and utilities (“COE”) is below zero. In 2015, Aimco expects COE to be up approximately 1.7%. • Centralize: moving administrative tasks to Shared Service Center reduces cost and allows site teams to focus on sales and service. • Standardize: reduce complexity, increase purchasing volume discounts. • Invest: focus on total lifecycle costs and invest in more durable materials such has plank flooring instead of carpet, granite countertops instead of laminate. 7.0% Aimco (1) 20.0% Peer Avg (1) 16.2% CPI -1.8% Aimco COE (2) 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 125 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015E Cumulative Same Store Expense Growth 2008 - 2015E

10 PORTFOLIO STRATEGY To continuously upgrade our portfolio through redevelopment, property upgrades, acquisitions, and limited development activity. We do this through a strict paired-trade discipline with: DISPOSITION of 5-10% of our portfolio annually, primarily from submarkets with lower revenue growth prospects; and REINVESTMENT of these proceeds in properties in target submarkets with above-average revenue growth prospects. We maintain sufficient geographic and price point DIVERSIFICATION to limit volatility and concentration risk, while focusing investment in higher growth, higher margin submarkets. We offer a product that ATTRACTS highly qualified residents with positive prospects for income growth and the ability and willingness to pay for high quality properties and service.

On average, during the last four years, we have disposed of 5% of our portfolio annually. • We fund redevelopment, development and property upgrades from the sale of 2-3% of assets each year (~$200-$300M) and fund acquisitions with additional sales up to the 5-10% target, only if accretive opportunities are identified that improve portfolio quality. • Activity over the last four years has been leverage-neutral. * Represents gross investment in real estate net of property debt utilized to fund the investment. During 2015, Aimco reduced leverage on redevelopment by use of proceeds from its January 2015 equity issuance.

6.1x 7.1x 5.1x Peer Wt. Avg. Aimco Aimco Adj for Refunding Risk HIGH QUALITY BALANCE SHEET • Aimco Debt and Preferred Equity to EBITDA of 7.1x reflects outstanding balances at 9/30/2015, but overstates the refunding risk of our leverage. • Our property debt balances at maturity are more than $800 million lower than are current balances as scheduled amortization is paid from retained earnings. (1) Peer group consists of AvalonBay, Camden, Equity Residential, Essex, MAA, Post Properties and UDR. Peer weighted average computed by Aimco based on 9/30/2015 debt and preferred equity balances, less cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, divided by last twelve months recurring EBITDA, all as reported by SNL Financial. Balances are adjusted to reflect company share of unconsolidated debt and NOI. For Aimco, leverage represents Aimco’s share of property debt, preferred equity and any balance on the revolving credit facility, reduced by Aimco’s share of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments in a securitization trust that holds Aimco property loans. See further information in Aimco’s 3Q 2015 Earnings Release. (2) Refunding Risk is lower than Total Leverage because property debt balances are reduced by scheduled amortization funded from retained earnings and because perpetual preferred equity is not subject to mandatory refunding.
