“2019 was a transformative year for Masco,” said Allman. “We executed on our strategy to become more focused on our higher margin, lower ticket, and less cyclical Plumbing and Decorative Architectural Products segments. We also delivered on our commitments, achieving sales growth of 2 percent in local currencies and adjusted earnings per share growth from continuing operations of 6 percent, despite slower overall end markets and higher input costs for many of our products. Lastly, we continued our balanced capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 20.1 million shares for $896 million, increasing our dividend for the sixth year in a row, and reducing our debt by $201 million.”

“The fundamentals of the repair and remodel industry, which now represents approximately 90% of our business, remain strong,” continued Allman. “We believe our markets and our performance will improve throughout the year as we work through higher input costs in the first half of 2020, and we anticipate our adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.55 per share for 2020.”
