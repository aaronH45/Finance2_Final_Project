FARMINGTON, Conn., January 28, 2020 – United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) reported fourth quarter and full year 2019 results and announced its 2020 outlook for Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace Systems.

“United Technologies delivered record sales, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow in 2019 on continued aerospace strength and a return to profit growth at Otis,” said UTC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes. “Organic sales grew 5 percent and adjusted earnings and free cash flow exceeded the high end of the ranges we expected. In a year of unprecedented change, our 2019 financial performance is a testament to our focus on our customers and the hard work and dedication of the 240,000 employees across UTC.”

Hayes continued, “Operational separation activities for Otis and Carrier are substantially complete, and we are executing the final steps required to spin both businesses as independent companies early in the second quarter. We also remain excited about the transformational merger of UTC’s aerospace businesses with Raytheon to create Raytheon Technologies, which will be the premier aerospace and defense systems and services provider. Our goal is to have the merger ready to close concurrent with the portfolio separation.” 

Fourth Quarter 2019

Fourth quarter sales of $19.6 billion were up 8 percent over the prior year, including 1 point of organic sales growth and 8 points of net acquisition benefit, offset by 1 point of foreign exchange headwind. GAAP EPS of $1.32 was up 59 percent versus the prior year and included 46 cents of net nonrecurring charges and 16 cents of restructuring charges. Adjusted EPS of $1.94 was down 1 percent versus the prior year.

Net income in the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 67 percent versus the prior year and included $540 million of net nonrecurring charges. Cash flow from operations was $2.8 billion and capital expenditures were $897 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.9 billion.

Collins Aerospace commercial aftermarket sales were up 42 percent and up 9 percent organically. On a pro forma basis, Collins Aerospace commercial aftermarket sales were up 11 percent including Rockwell Collins. Pratt & Whitney commercial aftermarket sales were flat, following 11 percent growth in 2018. Equipment orders at Carrier were down 4 percent organically. Otis new equipment orders were up 3 percent at constant currency in the quarter and flat on a rolling twelve month basis. 

Full Year 2019 

Full year sales of $77.0 billion were up 16 percent over the prior year, including 5 points of organic sales growth and 12 points of net acquisition benefit, offset by 1 point of foreign exchange headwind. Full year GAAP EPS of $6.41 was down 1 percent versus the prior year and included $1.85 of net restructuring charges and other significant items, including $1.46 of one-time portfolio separation costs. Adjusted EPS of $8.26 was up 9 percent versus the prior year. 

Net income for the year was $5.5 billion, up 5 percent versus the prior year. Cash flow from operations was $8.9 billion and capital expenditures were $2.3 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $6.6 billion, including approximately $400 million of one-time portfolio separation cash costs.

In 2019, the Pratt & Whitney GTF engine achieved over 4.6 million cumulative revenue flight hours and ended the year with 47 operators benefiting from reduced fuel burn, emissions and noise. Collins Aerospace continued to deliver strong performance and achieved approximately $300 million in cost synergies during the year, remaining on track to deliver at least $600 million in cost synergies by year four. Otis completed one of the largest and most complex modernization projects to date at the Empire State Building, including the installation of a custom-made Gen2 glass elevator. Carrier continued its commitment to innovation, launching more than 100 new products for the fifth year in a row. 

Outlook for 2020

Given the upcoming portfolio actions, the outlook for sales, adjusted EPS and free cash flow for Raytheon Technologies will be provided after the merger closes. 

The outlooks for Carrier and Otis will be provided in conjunction with their upcoming pre-spin investor meetings scheduled for February 10th and 11th, respectively. 

For Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace, we provide the following 2020 outlook*:

•Pratt & Whitney sales up mid single digit versus 2019;

•Pratt & Whitney adjusted operating profit up $225 to $275 million versus 2019; 

•Collins Aerospace sales down low single digit versus 2019, including an estimated 5 point headwind resulting from the suspension of 737 MAX production, lower ADS-B mandate sales and the expected impact of divestitures associated with the Raytheon merger;

•Collins Aerospace adjusted operating profit down $275 to $325 million versus 2019, including an estimated headwind of approximately $550 to $600 million resulting from the 737 MAX, lower ADS-B mandate profit and the expected impact of divestitures associated with the Raytheon merger.

*Note: When we provide expectations for adjusted operating profit on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures generally is not available without unreasonable effort. See “Use and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information.

Use and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

United Technologies Corporation (“UTC”) reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under GAAP with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP information presented provides investors with additional useful information, but should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the related GAAP measures. Moreover, other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently, which limits the usefulness of these measures for comparisons with such other companies. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

Adjusted net sales, organic sales, adjusted operating profit, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”), and the adjusted effective tax rate are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted net sales represents consolidated net sales from continuing operations (a GAAP measure), excluding significant items of a non-recurring and/or nonoperational nature (hereinafter referred to as “other significant items”). Organic sales represents consolidated net sales (a GAAP measure), excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures completed in the preceding twelve months and other significant items. Adjusted operating profit represents income from continuing operations (a GAAP measure), excluding restructuring costs and other significant items. Adjusted net income represents net income from continuing operations (a GAAP measure), excluding restructuring costs and other significant items. Adjusted EPS represents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (a GAAP measure), excluding restructuring costs and other significant items. The adjusted effective tax rate represents the effective tax rate (a GAAP measure), excluding restructuring costs and other significant items. For the business segments, when applicable, adjustments of net sales, operating profit and margins similarly reflect continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other significant items. GAAP financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates (AFX). We use the non-GAAP measure “at constant currency” or “CFX” to show changes in our financial results without giving effect to period-to-period currency fluctuations. Under U.S. GAAP, income statement results are translated in U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate for the period presented. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures just mentioned are useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of the Company’s ongoing operational performance. 

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents cash flow from operations (a GAAP measure) less capital expenditures. Management believes free cash flow is a useful measure of liquidity and an additional basis for assessing UTC's ability to fund its activities, including the financing of acquisitions, debt service, repurchases of UTC's common stock and distribution of earnings to shareholders.

A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding amounts prepared in accordance with GAAP appears in the tables in this Appendix. The tables provide additional information as to the items and amounts that have been excluded from the adjusted measures. 

When we provide our expectation for adjusted EPS, adjusted operating profit, adjusted effective tax rate, organic sales and free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures (expected diluted EPS from continuing operations, operating profit, the effective tax rate, sales and expected cash flow from operations) generally is not available without unreasonable effort due to potentially high variability, complexity and low visibility as to the items that would be excluded from the GAAP measure in the relevant future period, such as unusual gains and losses, the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact and timing of potential acquisitions and divestitures, and other structural changes or their probable 

significance. The variability of the excluded items may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP results.
