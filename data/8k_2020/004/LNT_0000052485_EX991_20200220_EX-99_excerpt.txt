ALLIANT ENERGY ANNOUNCES 2019 RESULTS

MADISON, Wis. - February 20, 2020 - Alliant Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: LNT) today announced U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP consolidated unaudited earnings per share (EPS) for 2019 and 2018 as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

“In 2019, we once again delivered solid financial and operational results. Consistent with our 5-7% long-term earnings growth goal, our temperature-normalized non-GAAP earnings per share increased 7% over calendar year 2018,” said John Larsen, Alliant Energy Chairman, President and CEO. “We’re putting renewable energy to work for our customers by advancing our renewable energy investments and preparing the energy grid for more distributed energy resources.”

Utilities and Corporate Services - Alliant Energy’s Utilities and Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc. (Corporate Services) operations generated $2.22 per share of GAAP EPS in 2019, which was $0.14 per share higher than 2018. The primary drivers of higher EPS were higher earnings due to Interstate Power and Light Company’s (IPL’s) and Wisconsin Power and Light Company’s (WPL’s) increasing rate base. This item was partially offset by higher depreciation expense, higher interest expense and equity dilution.

Non-utility and Parent - Alliant Energy’s Non-utility and Parent operations generated $(0.03) per share of GAAP EPS in 2019, which was $0.02 per share lower than 2018. The primary driver of lower EPS was higher interest expense.

Earnings Adjustments - Non-GAAP EPS for 2019 excludes earnings of $0.02 per share related to ATC return on equity (ROE) reserve adjustments due to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision in the fourth quarter of 2019 regarding Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. transmission owners’ authorized ROE. Non-GAAP EPS for 2018 excludes earnings of $0.02 per share related to Federal Tax Reform adjustments as a result of clarifying rules issued in 2018. Non-GAAP adjustments, which relate to material charges or income that are not normally associated with ongoing operations, are provided as a supplement to results reported in accordance with GAAP.

Temperature Impacts to Non-GAAP EPS - The estimated net impacts of temperatures on retail electric and gas sales were $0.05 per share and $0.06 per share gains in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS was $2.26 and $2.11 for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Details regarding GAAP EPS variances between 2019 and 2018 for Alliant Energy are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Higher revenue requirements primarily due to increasing rate base - In March 2019, IPL filed a request with the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to increase annual rates for its Iowa retail electric customers by $204 million, based on a 2020 forward-looking test period. IPL concurrently filed for interim retail electric rates based on 2018 historical data adjusted for certain known and measurable changes occurring in the first quarter of 2019. An interim retail electric rate increase of $90 million, on an annual basis, was implemented effective April 2019. In October 2019, IPL filed a partial settlement agreement with the IUB to increase annual rates for its Iowa retail electric customers by $127 million. This settlement agreement was approved by the IUB in January 2020. As part of this agreement, IPL will refund $8 million of 2019 interim rates in 2020. IPL recognized $0.34 per share of higher electric margins in 2019 due to retail electric rate increases, including the interim refund agreed to as part of the settlement.

In December 2018, WPL received an order from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approving WPL’s proposed settlement for its retail electric and gas rate review covering the 2019/2020 Test Period, effective January 1, 2019. Under the settlement, WPL’s retail electric and gas base rates will not change from current levels through the end of 2020. The $61 million retail electric revenue requirement increase for 2019, resulting from increasing investments in rate base, was offset by lower fuel-related costs and federal tax reform refunds. WPL recognized $0.21 per share of higher electric margins from increasing investments in rate base in 2019.

Net temperature impact of electric and gas sales - Alliant Energy’s retail electric and gas sales increased in 2019 and 2018 due to impacts of temperatures on customer demand.

WPL’s recent retail electric and gas rate orders included an earnings sharing mechanism whereby WPL must defer a portion of its earnings and return this amount to its retail electric and gas customers if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeds 10.25%. As a result, a portion of the higher margins recognized at WPL due to the temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales in 2019 and 2018 is expected to be returned to customers in the future.

A portion of Alliant Energy’s performance pay is based on earnings. As a result, a portion of the higher earnings resulting from the temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales in 2019 and 2018 was offset by higher performance pay expense. Alliant Energy’s estimated temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales, net of the WPL earnings sharing mechanism and the portion of performance pay associated with temperature impacts on earnings, was estimated to be a $0.05 per share and $0.06 per share increase in earnings for 2019 and 2018, respectively.

2020 Earnings Guidance

Alliant Energy’s consolidated EPS guidance of $2.34 to $2.48 for 2020 remains unchanged. Drivers for Alliant Energy’s 2020 earnings guidance include, but are not limited to:

•Ability of IPL and WPL to earn their authorized rates of return

•Stable economy and resulting implications on utility sales

•Normal temperatures in its utility service territories

•Execution of cost controls

•Execution of capital expenditure and financing plans

•Consolidated effective tax rate of (11%)

The 2020 earnings guidance does not include the impacts of any material non-cash valuation adjustments, regulatory-related charges or credits, reorganizations or restructurings, future changes in laws, regulations or regulatory policies, adjustments made to deferred tax assets and liabilities from valuation allowances, adjustments related to guarantees, pending lawsuits and disputes, federal and state income tax audits and other Internal Revenue Service proceedings, or changes in GAAP and tax methods of accounting that may impact the reported results of Alliant Energy.

“The customers and the communities we serve will continue to benefit from reliable, affordable, cleaner energy as a result of our strong pipeline of investments in renewable energy, and electric and gas distribution. Our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 to $2.48 per share is consistent with our long-term growth objective of 5% to 7% annually,” said Larsen.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To provide investors with additional information regarding Alliant Energy’s financial results, this press release includes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures include the use of (1) income and EPS for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2019 excluding the ATC ROE reserve adjustments; and (2) income and EPS for the year ended December 31, 2018 excluding the tax return adjustments due to Federal Tax Reform. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide an alternate measure to better understand and compare across periods the operating performance of Alliant Energy without the distortion of items that management believes are not normally associated with ongoing operations, and also provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance. Alliant Energy’s management also uses income, as adjusted, to determine performance-based compensation.

In addition, Alliant Energy included in this press release IPL; WPL; Corporate Services; Utilities and Corporate Services; ATC Holdings; and Non-utility and Parent EPS for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Alliant Energy believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends, and provide additional information about Alliant Energy’s operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance.

This press release references year-over-year variances in utility electric margins and utility gas margins. Utility electric margins and utility gas margins are non-GAAP financial measures that are reported and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income, in our 2019 Form 10-K.

This press release also includes temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Alliant Energy believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because the measure facilitates period-to-period comparison of Alliant Energy’s operating performance and provides investors with information on a basis consistent with measures that management uses to assess Alliant Energy’s earnings growth rate.

The tax impact adjustments represent the impact of the tax effect of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments excluded from non-GAAP net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based on the estimated consolidated statutory tax rate.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings summaries that follow, and in the case of temperature-normalized non-GAAP EPS, in the press release above.

Note: Unless otherwise noted, all “per share” references in this release refer to earnings per diluted share.
