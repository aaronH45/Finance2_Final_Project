December 31, 2019

ROCKVILLE, Md. (February 10, 2020) - Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) today reported operating results for its year and quarter ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, net income available for common shareholders was $4.61 per diluted share and $3.18 per diluted share, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, net income available for common shareholders was $1.92 per diluted share and $0.71 per diluted share, respectively.

Key Highlights of the full year and quarter include:

For the fourth quarter, generated FFO per diluted share of $1.58 compared to $1.57 for the fourth quarter 2018.

•Generated comparable property operating income (POI) growth of 2.9% for the year ended 2019. For the fourth quarter, comparable property POI growth was 2.4%.

•Signed leases for 461,952 square feet of comparable space in the fourth quarter at an average rent of $37.78 psf and achieved cash basis rollover growth on those comparable spaces of 7%.

•Sold three properties and two land parcels for $304 million in 2019 including the sale under threat of condemnation of an 11.7-acre portion of San Antonio Center, located in Mountain View, California, for $155 million in the fourth quarter.

•Purchased three properties in 2019 totaling 380,000 square feet and 123 apartment units for $295 million. Purchased one property subsequent to quarter end totaling 49,000 square feet for $22 million.

•Introduced 2020 FFO per diluted share guidance range of $6.40 to $6.58.

“With over a billion dollars invested in 2019 acquisitions and construction currently in progress at our established properties, we’re committed to maintaining and growing our leadership position in some of the best retail-centric real

estate in the country,” said Donald C. Wood, Federal Realty’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “To be able to make that level of investment while also growing current earnings is a testament to the quality of our real estate and the diversity of our income streams.”

Financial Results

For the full year 2019, Federal Realty reported net income available for common shareholders of $345.8 million and earnings per diluted share of $4.61. This compares to net income available for common shareholders of $233.9 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.18 for the full year 2018. Net income available for common shareholders was $145.3 million and earnings per diluted share was $1.92 for the fourth quarter 2019 versus $52.5 million and $0.71, respectively, for the fourth quarter 2018.

For the full year 2019, Federal Realty generated funds from operations available for common shareholders (FFO) of $465.8 million, or $6.17 per diluted share ($6.33 excluding the $11.9 million charge related to the buyout of the Kmart lease at Assembly). This compares to FFO of $461.8 million, or $6.23 per diluted share, for the full year 2018. For the fourth quarter 2019, FFO was $120.0 million, or $1.58 per diluted share, compared to $117.2 million, or $1.57 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2018.

FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental earnings measure which the Trust considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is attached to this press release.

Portfolio Results

The overall portfolio was 94.2% leased as of December 31, 2019, and the comparable portfolio was 94.9% leased. Comparable property POI increased 2.9% for the year 2019 and 2.4% in the fourth quarter. Comparable property POI represents our consolidated property portfolio other than those properties that distort comparability between periods in two primary categories (1) assets that were not owned for the full quarter in both periods presented and (2) assets currently under development or being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment. Additionally, the charge related to the buyout of the Kmart lease at Assembly is excluded.

For the year 2019, Federal Realty signed 409 leases for 1.7 million square feet of retail space. On a comparable space basis (i.e., spaces for which there was a former tenant), Federal Realty leased 1.6 million square feet at an average rent of $40.48 per square foot compared to the average contractual rent of $37.63 per square foot for the last year of the prior leases, representing a cash basis rollover growth on those comparable spaces of 8%.

During fourth quarter 2019, Federal Realty signed 112 leases for 494,768 square feet of retail space. On a comparable space basis (i.e., spaces for which there was a former tenant), Federal Realty leased 461,952 square feet at an average rent of $37.78 per square foot compared to the average contractual rent of $35.41 per square foot for the last year of the prior leases, representing a cash basis rollover growth on those comparable spaces of 7%.

Federal Realty’s Board of Trustees also declared a quarterly cash dividend on its Class C depositary shares, each representing 1/1000 of a 5.000% Series C Cumulative Preferred Share of Beneficial Interest, of $0.3125 per depositary share. All dividends on the depositary shares will be payable on April 15, 2020 to shareholders of record as of April 1, 2020.

(1)There is no guarantee that the Trust will ultimately complete any or all of these opportunities, that the Projected Return on Investment (ROI) or Projected Costs will be the amounts shown or that stabilization will occur as anticipated. The projected ROI and Projected Cost are management's best estimate based on current information and may change over time. 

(2)Projected ROI for redevelopment projects generally reflects only the deal specific cash, unleveraged incremental Property Operating Income (POI) generated by the redevelopment and is calculated as Incremental POI divided by incremental cost. Incremental POI is the POI generated by the redevelopment after deducting rent being paid or management's estimate of rent to be paid for the redevelopment space and any other space taken out of service to accommodate the redevelopment. Projected ROI for redevelopment projects does NOT include peripheral impacts, such as the impact on future lease rollovers at the property or the impact on the long-term value of the property.  

(3)Stabilization is generally the year in which 90% physical occupancy of the redeveloped space is achieved. Economic stabilization may occur at a later point in time.

Glossary of Terms

EBITDA for Real Estate ("EBITDAre"): EBITDAre is a non-GAAP measure that the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines as: net income computed in accordance with GAAP plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on sale of real estate, impairments of real estate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. We calculate EBITDAre consistent with the NAREIT definition. As EBITDA is a widely known and understood measure of performance, management believes EBITDAre represents an additional non-GAAP performance measure, independent of a company's capital structure, that will provide investors with a uniform basis to measure the enterprise value of a company. EBITDAre also approximates a key performance measure in our debt covenants, but it should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net income to EBITDAre for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) For the periods noted above, the provision (benefit) for income tax primarily relates to condominium sales gains.

(2) Excluding the charge related to the buyout of the Kmart lease at Assembly Square Marketplace, our EBITDAre would have been $611.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Funds From Operations (FFO): FFO is a supplemental measure of real estate companies' operating performances. NAREIT defines FFO as follows: net income, computed in accordance with GAAP plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses on sale of real estate, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate. NAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure of performance and liquidity of an equity REIT in order to recognize that the value of income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. However, FFO does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income); should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance; and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to pay dividends. We consider FFO a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. 

Property Operating Income: Rental income and mortgage interest income, less rental expenses and real estate taxes.

Overall Portfolio: Includes all operating properties owned in reporting period.

Comparable Properties: Represents our consolidated property portfolio other than those properties that distort comparability between periods in two primary categories: (1) assets that were not owned for the full quarter in both periods presented and (2) assets currently under development or being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment. Comparable property growth statistics are calculated on a GAAP basis. 

Tenant Improvements and Incentives: Represents not only the total dollars committed for the improvement (fit-out) of a space as it relates to a specific lease and, except for redevelopments, may also include base building costs (i.e. expansion, escalators or new entrances) which are required to make the space leasable. Incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements. Costs related to redevelopments require judgment by management in determining what reflects base building cost and thus, is not included in the "tenant improvements and incentives" amount.
