Other Events   

Cash Tender Offers  

On February 3, 2020, V.F. Corporation (the “Company”) issued a press release announcing its commencement of cash tender offers (each, a “Tender Offer” and collectively the “Tender Offers”) for any and all of the Company’s $300 million total aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.000% Notes due 2033 (the “2033 Notes”) and $350 million total aggregate principal amount of outstanding 6.450% Notes due 2037 (the “2037 Notes” and together with the 2033 Notes, the “Securities”). The Tender Offers are subject to a number of conditions, including a financing condition. The Tender Offers are being made only pursuant to the Offer to Purchase, dated February 3, 2020 (the “Offer to Purchase”), which sets forth the terms and conditions of the Tender Offers. This Current Report on Form 8-K is neither an offer to purchase nor the solicitation of an offer to sell any Securities.  

The Tender Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 2, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated, and tendered Securities may be withdrawn at or prior to, but not after, 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 14, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated. The foregoing is qualified by reference to the press release announcing the commencement of the Tender Offers that is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.  

Redemption  

On February 3, 2020, the Company issued a notice of redemption for $500 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 3.500% Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”). The redemption date for the 2021 Notes will be March 4, 2020 (the “Redemption Date”). The redemption price for the 2021 Notes will be calculated in accordance with the indenture governing the 2021 Notes and will be equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be redeemed and (ii) a make-whole amount based on the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the 2021 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date. As of December 28, 2019, $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 2021 Notes were outstanding. The foregoing does not constitute a notice of redemption for the 2021 Notes or an offer to purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell any securities.
