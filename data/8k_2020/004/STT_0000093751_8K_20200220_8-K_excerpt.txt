Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

State Street Corporation is reporting on this Current Report on Form 8-K an increase of $140 million to the fourth-quarter 2019 legal accrual associated with the invoicing matter first reported in December 2015. This additional accrual relates to events that developed subsequent to January 17, 2020, the date State Street originally announced its financial results for the fourth-quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2019.

The table below sets forth State Street’s summary financial results for the fourth-quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2019, both as originally announced on January 17, 2020 and as adjusted to reflect the effects of the $140 million legal accrual increase.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

State Street is making available an updated financial information addendum for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 reflecting the additional legal accrual. The updated addendum is furnished with this report as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference in this Item 2.02.

State Street’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof, will reflect the effects of the increased legal accrual and the adjusted financial results described above. 

Our legal accrual associated with the invoicing matter, including the increase described above, reflects our intention to seek to resolve the related pending government investigations and civil litigation. In late January 2020, the Department of Justice outlined a framework for a possible resolution of their review of this matter, and we have subsequently inquired of the Department of Labor on the status of their review. We expect that any settlement with the DOJ will include both financial and non-financial provisions.There can be no assurance that we will reach a settlement in any of these proceedings, including the DOJ or DOL reviews, on financial or other terms acceptable to us or at all. The aggregate amount of penalties that may potentially be imposed upon us in connection with the resolution of all government investigations and civil litigation relating to the invoicing matter is not currently known and might be significantly in excess of our current accrual. The outcome of any of these proceedings and, in particular, any criminal sanction could materially adversely affect our results of operations and could have significant collateral consequences for our business and reputation.

Forward Looking Statements 

This report, including this Item 2.02 and the materials furnished under Item 9.01, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of United States securities laws, including statements about our goals and expectations regarding pending government investigations and civil litigation associated with our previously disclosed invoicing matter, as well as regarding our business, financial and capital condition, results of operations, strategies, the financial and market outlook, dividend and stock purchase programs, governmental and regulatory initiatives and developments, expense reduction programs, new client business, and the business environment. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by such forward-looking terminology as “outlook,” “guidance,” “expect,” “priority,” “objective,” “intend,” “plan,” “forecast,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “seek,” “may,” “will,” “trend,” “target,” “strategy” and “goal,” or similar statements or variations of such terms. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, are inherently uncertain, are based on current assumptions that are difficult to predict and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in those statements.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited, those set forth in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K expected to be filed with the SEC on the date hereof. We encourage investors to read these filings, particularly the sections on risk factors, for additional information with respect to any forward-looking statements and prior to making any investment decision. The forward-looking statements contained in this report should not by relied on as representing our expectations or beliefs as of any time subsequent to the time this report is filed with the SEC, and we do not undertake efforts to revise those forward-looking statements to reflect events after that time.

Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

On February 20, 2020, State Street Corporation’s Board of Directors amended Article II Section 3 of the corporation’s by-laws, with immediate effect. The by-laws, as amended, allow for the removal of any director with or without cause at a meeting of shareholders duly called and noticed for that purpose. Prior to this amendment, the by-laws provided for the removal of a director by the shareholders only for cause. Other than this amendment, no other changes were made to the by-laws.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

On February 20, 2020, State Street Corporation made available an updated slide presentation providing highlights of its fourth-quarter 2019 and full-year 2019 results of operations and related information as of December 31, 2019. The updated slide presentation reflects the additional legal accrual disclosed in Item 2.02 above. A copy of that slide presentation is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated by reference in this Item 7.01.
