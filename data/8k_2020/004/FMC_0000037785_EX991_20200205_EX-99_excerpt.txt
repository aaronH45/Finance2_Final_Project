PHILADELPHIA, February 5, 2020 – FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) today reported fourth quarter 2019 revenue of $1.2 billion, an increase of 9 percent versus recast fourth quarter 2018, driven by higher volumes across all regions. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, year-over-year sales grew 11 percent organically. On a GAAP basis, the company reported a loss of $0.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. This compares to recast GAAP earnings of $0.24 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2018.1 

Fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $1.76 per diluted share, an increase of 21 percent versus recast fourth quarter 2018, and 25 cents above the midpoint of guidance. Year-over-year growth in the quarter was 

Page 2/ FMC Corporation Delivers Strong Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Results

driven by strong operational performance and a lower share count; EBITDA growth contributed 34 cents of the EPS growth, and the lower share count contributed 5 cents of EPS growth. Total company adjusted 

EBITDA was $320 million, an increase of 17 percent versus recast fourth quarter 2018 and at the top end of guidance. 1

“Our financial outperformance reflects the strength of our portfolio and new technology launches,” said Pierre Brondeau, chairman and CEO of FMC. “FMC delivered continued strong revenue growth in the quarter driven by high demand in all regions despite adverse weather conditions in Europe and Asia.”

FMC fourth quarter revenue growth was driven by an 11 percent contribution from volume, partially offset by a 2 percent currency headwind. FMC achieved higher year-over-year pricing in Latin America, EMEA and Asia. Latin America sales grew 10 percent year over year, led by strong growth in Argentina following significant changes the company made to its go-to-market access in that country. In North America, revenue increased 10 percent driven by volume growth and strength in Rynaxypyr® and Cyazypyr® insect controls. In Asia, revenue increased 9 percent with double-digit growth in India, China, Indonesia and Pakistan, driven by strong demand for the diamides and new product launches. Sales in EMEA grew 5 percent year over year due to higher demand for herbicides and insecticides in France and Russia.

For the full year, FMC reported revenue of $4.6 billion, an increase of 8 percent compared to recast 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, year-over-year sales grew 11 percent organically. On a GAAP basis, the company reported full-year earnings of $477 million, or $3.62 per diluted share. Full-year adjusted earnings were $6.09 per diluted share, an increase of 16 percent compared to the prior year. 1

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Free cash flow in 2019 was $302 million, more than double compared to recast 2018. 1 This was lower than the guidance range, due primarily to slower than expected collection of refunds of value added and similar taxes and delayed collections in Pakistan and Indonesia. Delays in collecting these tax refunds were driven by short-term complexities of operating in multiple SAP systems, particularly in India. Weather conditions in Pakistan and Indonesia impacted grower liquidity late in the quarter, which hampered collections. Both factors are execution related and will reverse. FMC expects to collect this cash in 2020.

2020 Outlook2

FMC full-year revenue is forecasted to be in the range of $4.8 to $4.95 billion, an increase of 6 percent at the midpoint versus 2019 driven by volume and pricing in all regions. Total company adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $1.3 to $1.34 billion, an increase of 8 percent at the midpoint versus 2019. Full-year adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.70 per diluted share, an increase of 8 percent at the midpoint versus 2019 and assuming weighted average diluted shares outstanding (WADSO) of approximately 131 million. 

First Quarter 2020 Outlook2

First quarter revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.23 billion to $1.27 billion, representing 5 percent growth at the midpoint compared to first quarter 2019. Total company adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be in the range of $346 million to $366 million, representing a 4 percent increase at the midpoint versus Q1 2019. FMC expects adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.76 to $1.86 in the first quarter, representing an increase of 5 percent at the midpoint versus Q1 2019 and assuming WADSO of approximately 131 million.

This press release contains certain “non-GAAP financial terms” which are defined on our website www.fmc.com. In addition, we have also provided on our website at www.fmc.com reconciliations of non-GAAP terms to the most directly comparable GAAP term. 

1.Recast 2018 financials, as filed on a Form 8-K on March 22, 2019, exclude the former Lithium segment, which allows us to show a true year-over-year comparable metric for the 2019 periods. 

2.Although we provide forecasts for non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to, adjusted earnings per share, total company adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, we are not able to forecast the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Certain elements of the composition of the GAAP amounts are not predictable, making it impractical for us to forecast. Such elements include, but are not limited to, restructuring, acquisition charges, and discontinued operations. As a result, no GAAP outlook is provided.

____________________

(1) The Company believes that the Non-GAAP financial measure “Adjusted After-Tax Earnings from Continuing Operations, Attributable to FMC Stockholders”, and its presentation on a per share basis, provides useful information about the Company’s operating results to investors and securities analysts. Adjusted earnings excludes the effects of Corporate special charges, tax-related adjustments and the results of our discontinued operations. The Company also believes that excluding the effects of these items from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of its underlying businesses from period to period.

(a) Three Months Ended December 31, 2019: 

Restructuring and other charges (income) is primarily comprised of charges of environmental sites of $96.4 million. $72.8 million of those charges were due to the unfavorable court ruling related to our decommissioned plant near Pocatello, Idaho. Restructuring and other charges (income) also includes a charge of $34.1 million as a result of the decision to exit all sales of Furadan® insecticide/nematicide (as well as Curaterr® insecticide/nematicide and any other brands used with carbofuran) end-use products globally. There were restructuring charges of $13.2 million associated with the continued integration of the DuPont Crop Protection Business. We expect restructuring charges associated with the continued integration of the DuPont Crop Protection Business to be largely complete by the first half of 2020.

Three Months Ended December 31, 2018: 

Restructuring and other charges (income) is primarily comprised of charges associated with the integration of the DuPont Crop Protection Business of $15.8 million. $8.8 million of these charges were for asset write-offs, $5.5 million was for severance, and $1.5 million was for other miscellaneous charges. There were also additional restructuring charges as well as other charges totaling $3.7 million. Additionally, restructuring and other charges (income) includes charges of environmental sites of $13.0 million and other Corporate charges of $2.3 million.

Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019:

Restructuring and other charges (income) primarily consists of charges of environmental sites of $108.7 million. As noted above, $72.8 million of those charges were due to the unfavorable court ruling related to our decommissioned plant near Pocatello, Idaho. Restructuring and other charges (income) also includes a charge of $34.1 million as a result of the decision made to exit all sales of Furadan® insecticide/nematicide (as well as Curaterr® insecticide/nematicide and any other brands used with carbofuran) end-use products globally. There were restructuring charges of $26.4 million associated with the continued integration of the DuPont Crop Protection Business. All remaining charges totaled $1.8 million. 

Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2018:

Restructuring and other charges (income) primarily consists of the total gain on sales of $87.2 million from the divestments of certain product portfolios as part of our commitment to both the European Commission and Competition Commission of India related to the DuPont Crop Protection Acquisition. Restructuring and other charges (income) also consists of $27.8 million of charges due to our decision to exit the Ewing R&D facility and $58.8 million of charges related to the change in our market access model in India. Other restructuring charges as we continued to integrate the acquired DuPont Crop Protection Business totaled to $21.7 million. There were also additional restructuring charges as well as other charges totaling $12.3 million. Restructuring and other charges (income) includes charges of environmental sites of $21.7 million and other Corporate charges of $6.1 million.

(b) Our non-operating pension and postretirement charges (income) are defined as those costs (benefits) related to interest, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements. These are excluded from our Adjusted Earnings and are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and we consider these costs to be outside our operational performance. We continue to include the service cost and amortization of prior service cost in our Adjusted Earnings results noted above. These elements reflect the current year operating costs to our businesses for the employment benefits provided to active employees.

(c) Charges related to the expensing of the inventory fair value step-up resulting from the application of acquisition accounting and legal and professional fees. We expect these charges associated with integrating the DuPont Crop Protection Business to be largely completed by the first half of 2020 which coincides with significant portions of the ERP system adoption and the TSA exit. Amounts represent the following:

(1) Represents transaction costs, costs for transitional employees, other acquired employees related costs, and transactional-related costs such as legal and professional third-party fees. These charges are recorded as a component of “Selling, general and administrative expense" on the condensed consolidated statements of income (loss).

(2) These charges are included in “Costs of sales and services” on the condensed consolidated statements of income (loss).

(d) The income tax expense (benefit) on Corporate special charges (income) is determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which the Corporate special charge or income occurred and includes both current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) based on the nature of the non-GAAP performance measure.

(e) Discontinued operations, net of income taxes include, in periods up to its separation on March 1, 2019, the results of FMC Lithium, including separation related costs, as well as provisions, net of recoveries, for environmental liabilities and legal reserves and expenses related to previously discontinued operations.

Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: 

The three months ended December 31, 2019 has no results of our FMC Lithium segment compared to a full quarter for the three months ended December 31, 2018. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a charge of approximately $106 million as a result of negotiations for a settlement agreement primarily to address discontinued operations at our Middleport, New York plant which was the subject of an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) entered into with the EPA and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation in 1991.

Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:

The twelve months ended December 31, 2019 includes two months of results of our FMC Lithium segment compared to a full twelve months in 2018. Partially offsetting the loss was the gain on sale of approximately $21 million, net of tax from the sale of the first of two parcels of land of our discontinued site in Newark, California. Discontinued operations, net of income taxes for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 includes the charge of approximately $106 million associated with our Middleport, New York plant discussed above.

(f) We exclude the GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from the Non-GAAP measure of income, and instead include a Non-GAAP tax provision based upon the annual Non-GAAP effective tax rate. The GAAP tax provision includes certain discrete tax items including, but not limited to: income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to ongoing business operations in the current year; unusual or infrequently occurring items; tax adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency remeasurement of certain foreign operations; certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years; certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets; and changes in tax law. Management believes excluding these discrete tax items assists investors and securities analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations thereby providing investors with useful supplemental information about FMC's operational performance.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an adjustment to our provisional tax expense of $7.8 million of income tax expense pertaining to a change in the net transition tax to be paid, the impact of the remeasurement of the Company’s U.S. net deferred tax assets and the realizability of the Company’s U.S. state net deferred tax assets.
