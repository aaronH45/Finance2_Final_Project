The company adopted the mark-to-market method of accounting for its pension and other postretirement benefits as of Dec. 31, 2018.

Excluding this expense, MTM-adjusted fourth quarter 2019 net earnings1 increased 12 percent to $949 million, or $5.61 per share, and 2019 MTM-adjusted net earnings1 totaled $3.6 billion, or $21.21 per share. 

“Northrop Grumman delivered strong results in 2019, and we continue to create sustained value for our shareholders and customers through an unwavering focus on performance, innovation and agility,” said Kathy Warden, chairman, chief executive officer and president. “With our diverse portfolio, we are positioned to meet our customers’ current and emerging needs.”

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Disclosure: This earnings release contains non-GAAP (accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) financial measures, as defined by SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) Regulation G and indicated by a footnote in the text of the release. Definitions for the non-GAAP measures are provided below and reconciliations are provided in the body of the release. Other companies may define these measures differently or may utilize different non-GAAP measures.

MTM-adjusted net earnings: Net earnings excluding MTM (expense) benefit and related tax impacts. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the non-operational impact of pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. This measure is also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of MTM accounting is not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards. MTM-adjusted net earnings is reconciled in the “MTM-adjusted Earnings and EPS” table within the body of this release.

MTM-adjusted diluted EPS: Diluted earnings per share excluding the per share impact of MTM (expense) benefit and related tax impacts. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance per share by presenting the company’s diluted earnings per share results before the non-operational impact of pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. MTM-adjusted diluted EPS is reconciled in the “MTM-adjusted Earnings and EPS” table within the body of this release.

Segment operating income and segment operating margin rate: Segment operating income, as reconciled in the “Consolidated Operating Results and Cash Flows” table within the body of this release, and segment operating margin rate (segment operating income divided by sales) reflect total earnings from our four segments, including allocated pension expense recognized under CAS, and excluding unallocated corporate items and FAS pension expense. These measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP. 

Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We use free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, stock repurchases and the payment of dividends. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow is reconciled in the “Consolidated Operating Results and Cash Flows” table within the body of this release.
