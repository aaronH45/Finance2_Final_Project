CEO COMMENTARY

Harris H. Simmons, Chairman and CEO, of Zions Bancorporation, commented, “Fourth quarter earnings of $174 million or $0.97 per share were dampened by comparatively flat loan volumes and $37 million in severance and restructuring charges to facilitate a cost reduction initiative that will largely take effect during the first quarter of 2020. We were nevertheless pleased with the strong 10.5% annualized growth in average deposit balances we experienced during the quarter, including 7.5% annualized growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits; and by the relative stability of our net interest margin in a challenging interest rate and competitive environment.” Mr. Simmons continued, “Economic conditions throughout the markets we serve remain vibrant, and we are optimistic that credit quality will continue to be relatively strong in 2020.”

Comparisons noted in the sections below are calculated for the current quarter versus the same prior-year period, unless otherwise specified. Growth rates of 100% or more are rendered as not meaningful as they are generally reflective of a low initial starting point.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net interest income decreased $17 million to $559 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 from $576 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Total interest income decreased $9 million due to a $10 million decrease in interest on securities, primarily resulting from an $804 million decline in the average securities balance and a decline in the average yield received on securities, discussed in further detail below. Interest expense increased $8 million primarily due to increases in the rate paid on deposits.

The yield on interest earning assets was 4.00%, a decrease of 15 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2019, and a decrease of 17 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. Interest income recoveries did not materially impact this quarter or the prior periods presented. The yield on securities decreased 4 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2019 primarily due to a decline in interest rates, and 13 basis points from the year ago rate primarily from increased premium amortization in our Small Business Administration (“SBA”) portfolio resulting from faster repayment speeds. The yield on loans decreased 19 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2019 and 23 basis points from the year ago rate, primarily due to a decline in interest rates across all loan products. 

The rate paid on total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities was 0.57% for the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease from 0.71% for the third quarter of 2019, and an increase from 0.54% for the fourth quarter of 2018. The decline in the rate paid on total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities from the third quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower rates paid on all interest bearing liabilities, in addition to deposit growth and lower use of short-term borrowings. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2018 was due to an increase in the cost of deposits. The annualized cost of total

deposits for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 0.44%, compared with 0.50% for the third quarter of 2019, and 0.35% for the fourth quarter of 2018.

The net interest margin decreased to 3.46% in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with 3.48% in the third quarter of 2019, and 3.67% in the same prior year period. The decrease from the third quarter of 2019 was primarily due to lower loan yields, partially offset by a lower rate paid on total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities. The decrease from the same prior year period was primarily due to lower loan and securities yields and a higher rate paid on total deposits and interest-bearing liabilities.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased by $12 million, or 9%, to $152 million from $140 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. Customer-related fees increased $3 million, or 2%, as a result of higher capital markets and foreign exchange fees, wealth management and trust income and commercial account fees, partially offset by a decrease in card fees. Dividends and other income increased $9 million primarily due to a positive $6 million valuation adjustment on client-related interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with a negative $3 million valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2018.

January 21, 2020

Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $472 million, an increase of $52 million, or 12%, when compared with $420 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily as a result of a $35 million increase in salaries and employee benefits and a $21 million increase in other noninterest expense. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2018 in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to a $20 million increase in severance expenses as a result of the previously announced reduction in staffing levels, an $8 million increase in base salaries mainly due to annual salary merit increases, and a $4 million increase in employee benefits.

Other noninterest expense increased primarily as a result of a $13 million impairment on owned or leased properties from actual and planned branch and other office building closures and $10 million of customer reimbursements made by the Bank to remedy a self-identified operational issue. Furniture, equipment, and software expense increased by $3 million as a result of increased amortization expense related to capitalized technology costs from the successful implementation of our commercial loan systems, while advertising expense decreased by $3 million. 

Our efficiency ratio was 61.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with 57.3% in the third quarter of 2019, and 57.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased $17 million, or 4%, to $435 million, compared with $418 million for the same prior year period. Adjusted noninterest expense for the current quarter excludes severance and restructuring costs of $22 million and $15 million, respectively, however it does not exclude the $10 million operational-related expense described previously. For information on non-GAAP financial measures, including differences between noninterest expense and adjusted noninterest expense, see pages 19-22.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Classified loans increased 15%, while nonperforming assets declined 2% from the fourth quarter of 2018. The ratio of nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due 90 days or more to loans and leases was 0.52%, compared with 0.56% in the fourth quarter of 2018.

The Bank recorded a $4 million provision for credit losses during the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with $10 million during the third quarter of 2019, and $6 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. The allowance for credit losses

January 21, 2020

was $554 million at December 31, 2019, compared with $552 million at December 31, 2018. The slight increase in the allowance for credit losses from the prior-year period is primarily due to loan growth, offset by recent default and loss rates that are lower than long-term averages. 

On January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and its subsequent updates, often referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL") model. Upon adoption of the guidance, Zions recorded the full amount of the allowance for credit losses of $526 million, compared with $554 million at December 31, 2019, resulting in an after-tax increase to retained earnings of approximately $20 million.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Loans and leases, net of unearned income and fees, increased $2.0 billion, or 4%, to $48.7 billion at December 31, 2019 from $46.7 billion at December 31, 2018. Within commercial loans, municipal loans increased $732 million, commercial and industrial loans increased $247 million, and owner-occupied loans increased $240 million. Term commercial real estate loans increased $405 million. The growth in consumer loans was primarily due to a $392 million increase in 1-4 family residential loans. Unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit increased $1.6 billion, or 7.2%, to $23.9 billion at December 31, 2019, from $22.3 billion at December 31, 2018.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total deposits increased by $3.0 billion, or 6%, to $57.1 billion as of December 31, 2019, while noninterest bearing deposits decreased slightly over the same period. Average total deposits increased to $56.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with $54.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018. Average noninterest bearing deposits declined 2% to $23.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with $24.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, and were 42% and 45% of average total deposits, respectively, for the same periods. 

Total borrowed funds decreased $2.6 billion, or 41%, to $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2019. Average borrowed funds decreased to $4.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with $4.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in both end of period and average borrowed funds reflects deposit growth exceeding loan growth and securities run-off.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Bank’s common stock dividend was $0.34 per share, compared with $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Common stock repurchases during the current quarter totaled $275 million, or 5.5 million shares, which is equivalent to 3.2% of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2019. During the last

four quarters, the Bank repurchased $1.1 billion, or 23.5 million shares, of common stock which is equivalent to 12.5% of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank had 29.3 million ZIONW warrants outstanding with a strike price of $33.91 per share that expire on May 22, 2020.

Common stock and additional paid-in capital decreased $1.1 billion, or 28%, from the fourth quarter of 2018, due to the previously mentioned share repurchases. Accumulated other comprehensive income improved $293 million, from a negative $250 million as of December 31, 2018, to $43 million as of December 31, 2019. The improvement was primarily a result of increases in the fair value of available-for-sale securities due to changes in interest rates.

Tangible book value per common share increased to $34.98 at December 31, 2019, compared with $31.97 at December 31, 2018, primarily due to a 12.0% decrease in common shares outstanding over the same period. Basel III common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) capital was $5.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and $6.2 billion at December 31, 2018. The estimated Basel III CET1 capital ratio was 10.2% at December 31, 2019 compared with 11.7% at December 31, 2018. For information on non-GAAP financial measures, see pages 19-22.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations

(Unaudited)

This press release presents non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to provide investors with additional information. The adjustments to reconcile from the applicable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures are presented in the following schedules. The Bank considers these adjustments to be relevant to ongoing operating results and provide a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to assess the performance and financial position of the Bank and for presentations of Bank performance to investors. The Bank further believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Bank on the same basis as that applied by management.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, and are not required to be uniformly applied by individual entities. Although non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders to evaluate a company, they have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP.

The following are non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release and a discussion of the reasons for which management uses these non-GAAP measures:

Tangible Book Value per Common Share – this schedule also includes “tangible common equity.” Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides additional useful information about the level of tangible equity in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information to management and others about capital adequacy because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations

(Unaudited)

Return on Average Tangible Common Equity – this schedule also includes “net earnings applicable to common shareholders, excluding the effects of the adjustments, net of tax” and “average tangible common equity.” Return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides useful information to management and others about the Bank’s use of shareholders’ equity. Management believes the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations 

(Unaudited)

Efficiency Ratio – this schedule also includes “adjusted noninterest expense,” “taxable-equivalent net interest income,” “adjusted taxable-equivalent revenue,” “pre-provision net revenue (PPNR)” and “adjusted PPNR.” The methodology of determining the efficiency ratio may differ among companies. Management makes adjustments to exclude certain items as identified in the subsequent schedules which it believes allows for more consistent comparability among periods. Management believes the efficiency ratio provides useful information regarding the cost of generating revenue. Adjusted noninterest expense provides a measure as to how well the Bank is managing its expenses, and adjusted PPNR enables management and others to assess the Bank’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. Taxable-equivalent net interest income allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.
