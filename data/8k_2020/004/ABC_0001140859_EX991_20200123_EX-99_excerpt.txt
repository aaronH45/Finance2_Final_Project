FISCAL 2020 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

Revenues of $47.9 Billion for the First Quarter, a 5.4 Percent Increase Year-Over-Year

First Quarter GAAP Diluted EPS of $0.90 and Adjusted Diluted EPS of $1.76 

Adjusted Diluted EPS Guidance Range Raised to $7.55 to $7.80 for Fiscal 2020

The Board of Directors Increased the Quarterly Dividend Rate by 5% to $0.42 per share

VALLEY FORGE, PA, January 30, 2020 - AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE:ABC) today reported that in its fiscal year 2020 first quarter ended December 31, 2019, revenue increased 5.4 percent to $47.9 billion. On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.90 for the December quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to $1.84 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes items described below, increased 10.0 percent to $1.76 in the fiscal first quarter. 

"We delivered strong revenue and adjusted EPS growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health groups," said Steven H. Collis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of AmerisourceBergen. "Our results continue to demonstrate the strength of AmerisourceBergen's unique pharmaceutical-centered strategy and compelling position in the U.S. market," said Mr. Collis.

In late January 2020 the Company decided to exit the PharMEDium compounding business and as a result, the Company will cease all commercial and administrative operations related to this business. Additional details can be found in the section labeled "PharMEDium Update".

"After a comprehensive strategic and financial review of the PharMEDium business and continued operational challenges and financial burden, we have determined that the best path forward is to shut down the PharMEDium business." Mr. Collis continued, "Our increased fiscal 2020 guidance reflects the ongoing strength of our business and the removal of PharMEDium's operating loss for the remainder of the fiscal year."

Today, the Company announced that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per common share, a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend rate from $0.40 per common share. The quarterly dividend of $0.42 per common share will be payable March 2, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 14, 2020.

"As we move further into fiscal 2020, we remain confident that we will continue to execute our unique and differentiated business strategy to deliver long-term growth for our shareholders," Mr. Collis said.

Segment Discussion

The Company's operations are comprised of the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment and other operating segments that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and, therefore, have been included in Other for the purpose of reportable segment presentation. Other consists of operating segments that focus on global commercialization services and animal health and includes AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS), World Courier and MWI Animal Health (MWI).

Pharmaceutical Distribution Services Segment

Pharmaceutical Distribution Services revenue was $46.0 billion, an increase of 5.2 percent compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year primarily due to continued strong specialty product sales and increased volume associated with the growth of some of its largest customers. Segment operating income of $391.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was up 5.0 percent compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to the increase in gross profit resulting from the growth in revenue. 

Other

Revenue in Other was $1.8 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, an increase of 10.5 percent compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to growth at MWI, ABCS and World Courier. Operating income in Other increased 5.6 percent to $104.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. This increase was primarily due to the performance of ABCS and World Courier.

Recent Company Highlights & Milestones

•AmerisourceBergen enhanced its logistics offering by integrating two of its businesses, World Courier, a global logistics provider, and ICS, a third party logistics (3PL) provider, creating the first and only specialty logistics partner to deliver complete support from clinical trials through commercialization. The integration offers enhanced global capabilities for manufacturers navigating the complexities of their product’s journey end-to-end, ultimately progressing the global growth of the advanced therapy industry and enabling more patients to be treated with these life-changing products.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•AmerisourceBergen received a perfect score of 100 on the 2019 Corporate Equality Index, the nation’s premier benchmarking survey and report on corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality, administered by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures described below. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These supplemental measures may vary from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies.

The non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance, to perform financial planning, and to determine incentive compensation. Therefore, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors. The presented non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that management does not believe reflect the Company’s core operating performance because such items are outside the control of the Company or are inherently unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash. We have included the following non-GAAP earnings-related financial measures in this release:

•Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit margin: Adjusted gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the gain from antitrust litigation settlements, LIFO expense (credit), certain PharMEDium remediation costs, and the (credit) related to the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act. Gain from antitrust litigation settlements and LIFO expense (credit) are excluded because the Company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items. PharMEDium remediation costs are excluded because they are unpredictable expenses. The (credit) related to the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act is excluded because it is unusual, non-recurring and non-cash. Adjusted gross profit margin is the ratio of adjusted gross profit to total revenue. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as a supplemental measure of the Company’s ongoing operating performance. The gain from antitrust litigation settlements relates to the settlement of lawsuits that have been filed against brand pharmaceutical manufacturers alleging that the manufacturer, by itself or in concert with others, took improper actions to delay or prevent generic drugs from entering the market. The PharMEDium remediation costs relate to costs incurred in connection with suspended production activities following U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspections. LIFO expense (credit) is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. The New York State Opioid Stewardship Act, which went into effect on July 1, 2018, established an annual $100 million fund and requires manufacturers, distributors, and importers to ratably share the assessment based upon opioids sold or distributed to or within New York state. In December 2018, the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. 

•Adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating expense margin: Adjusted operating expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes acquisition-related intangibles amortization, employee severance, litigation, and other, certain PharMEDium remediation costs, and impairment of long-lived assets. Adjusted operating expense margin is the ratio of adjusted operating expenses to total revenue. Acquisition-related intangibles amortization is excluded because it is a non-cash item and does not reflect the operating performance of the acquired companies. We exclude employee severance amounts that relate to unpredictable and/or non-recurring business restructuring. We exclude the amount of litigation settlements and other expenses, as well as PharMEDium remediation costs and the impairment of long-lived assets, that are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature because we believe these exclusions facilitate the analysis of our ongoing operational performance.

•Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin: Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the same items that are described above and excluded from adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expenses. Adjusted operating income margin is the ratio of adjusted operating income to total revenue. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as a supplemental way to evaluate the Company’s performance because the adjustments are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature.

•Adjusted income before income taxes: Adjusted income before income taxes is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the same items that are described above and excluded from adjusted operating income. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it facilitates the calculation of the Company’s adjusted effective tax rate.

•Adjusted effective tax rate: Adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure that is determined by dividing adjusted income tax expense/benefit by adjusted income before income taxes. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it presents an effective tax rate that does not reflect unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash amounts or items that are outside the control of the Company.

•Adjusted income tax expense: Adjusted income tax expense is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the income tax expense associated with the same items that are described above and excluded from adjusted income before income taxes. In addition, the final U.S. tax reform measurement period adjustment to the one-time transition tax liability on historical foreign earnings and profits through December 31, 2017 ("Tax Reform") is excluded from adjusted income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2018. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as a supplemental way to evaluate the Company’s performance because the adjustments are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature.

•Adjusted net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest: Adjusted net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest excludes the non-controlling interest portion of acquisition-related intangibles amortization. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it facilitates the calculation of adjusted net income attributable to ABC. 

•Adjusted net income attributable to ABC: Adjusted net income attributable to ABC is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the same items that are described above. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as a supplemental way to evaluate the Company's performance because the adjustments are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature.

•Adjusted diluted earnings per share: Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the per share impact of adjustments including gain from antitrust litigation settlements; LIFO expense (credit); PharMEDium remediation costs; the (credit) related to the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act; acquisition-related intangibles amortization; employee severance, litigation, and other; and impairment of long-lived assets; in each case net of the tax effect calculated using the applicable effective tax rate for those items. In addition, the per share impact of Tax Reform is excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2018. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the per share impact of the items that are outside the control of the Company or that we consider to not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash nature.

In addition, the Company has provided non-GAAP fiscal year 2020 guidance for diluted earnings per share, operating expense, operating income, and effective income tax rate that excludes the same or similar items as those that are excluded from the historical non-GAAP financial measures, as well as significant items that are outside the control of the Company or inherently unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature. In addition, it has provided fiscal year 2020 adjusted free cash flow guidance. For fiscal year 2020, we have defined the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding other significant unpredictable or non-recurring cash payments or receipts relating to legal settlements, minus capital expenditures. For the three months ended December 31, 2019 adjusted free cash flow of $133.7 million consisted of net cash provided by operating activities of $142.8 million, plus $66.7 million in cash payments made relating to unfavorable legal settlements, minus $8.5 million in cash payments received related to favorable legal settlements, and minus capital expenditures of $67.3 million. The Company does not provide forward looking guidance on a GAAP basis for such metrics because certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated. For example, LIFO expense (credit) is largely dependent upon the future inflation or deflation of brand and generic pharmaceuticals, which is out of the Company’s control, and acquisition-related intangibles amortization depends on the timing and amount of future acquisitions, which cannot be reasonably estimated. Similarly, the timing and amount of litigation settlements is unpredictable and non-recurring.
