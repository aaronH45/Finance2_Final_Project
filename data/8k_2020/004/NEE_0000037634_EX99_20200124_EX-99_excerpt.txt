NextEra Energy reports fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 financial results

•NextEra Energy delivers strong full-year financial and operational results

•Florida Power & Light Company's continued investments in the business to further advance its customer value proposition result in residential bills nearly 30% below the national average and best-ever service reliability

JUNO BEACH, Fla. - NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE) today reported 2019 fourth-quarter net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $975 million, or $1.99 per share, compared to $422 million, or $0.88 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2018. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy's 2019 fourth-quarter earnings were $706 million, or $1.44 per share, compared to $718 million, or $1.49 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2018.

For the full year 2019, NextEra Energy reported net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $3.769 billion, or $7.76 per share, compared to $6.638 billion, or $13.88 per share, in 2018. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy's full-year 2019 earnings were $4.062 billion, or $8.37 per share, compared to $3.673 billion, or $7.70 per share, in 2018, which represents year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings per share of approximately 8.7%.

Adjusted earnings for these periods exclude the effects of transitional impacts of tax reform, including the impact on differential membership interests; non-qualifying hedges; NextEra Energy Partners, LP net investment gains; change in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear decommissioning funds and other than temporary impairments (OTTI); operating results from the Spain solar projects; and acquisition-related expenses.

NextEra Energy's management uses adjusted earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, internally for financial planning, analysis of performance, reporting of results to the board of directors and as an input in determining performance-based compensation under the company's employee incentive compensation plans. NextEra Energy also uses earnings expressed in this fashion when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to analysts and investors. NextEra Energy's management believes that adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of NextEra Energy's fundamental earnings power. A reconciliation of historical adjusted earnings to net income attributable to NextEra Energy, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is included in the attachments to this news release.

"NextEra Energy's performance in 2019 was strong both financially and operationally with outstanding execution on all of our initiatives," said Jim Robo, chairman and chief executive officer of NextEra Energy. "We achieved approximately 8.7% growth in adjusted earnings per share for the year and delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 43%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index. During 2019, FPL successfully executed smart capital investments to improve its already best-in-class customer value proposition. As a result, FPL's typical residential electric bill remains nearly 30% below the national average, and FPL was recognized for the fourth time in five years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. At Gulf Power Company, we had terrific execution throughout the first year of ownership and delivered significant value to customers and shareholders. The NextEra Energy Resources team continues to capitalize on what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history, adding more than 5,800 megawatts to its contracted renewables backlog and commissioning another approximately 2,700 megawatts of wind and solar projects, including repowering. I continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy's long-term growth prospects and will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in 2020, 2021 and 2022, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings." 

Florida Power & Light Company

FPL, which serves more than 5 million customer accounts in Florida and is the largest rate-regulated electric utility in the United States as measured by retail electricity produced and sold, reported fourth-quarter 2019 net income of $400 million, or $0.81 per share, compared to $407 million, or $0.85 per share, for the prior-year quarter. For the full year 2019, FPL reported net income on a GAAP basis of $2.334 billion, or $4.81 per share, compared to $2.171 billion, or $4.55 per share, in 2018.

FPL's full-year growth was primarily driven by continued investment in the business. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, bringing its full-year capital investments to a total of roughly $5.8 billion. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 8.3% for 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2019, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 100,000 from the prior-year comparable quarter.

FPL continues to identify smart capital investments in clean, efficient, modernized generation, as well as a stronger and smarter grid, to further enhance its already best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability, award-winning customer service and a clean emissions profile. FPL's typical residential electric bill remains nearly 30% below the national average and among the lowest of all 54 electric providers in the state of Florida. Earlier this month, the typical FPL residential customer monthly bill decreased nearly $4, or approximately 4%. FPL had continued success with its cost-saving initiatives, reducing its already best-in-class dollar per retail-megawatt-hour non-fuel O&M costs by more than 5% year-over-year. These ongoing cost savings, combined with the flexibility afforded by FPL's current settlement agreement, enabled FPL to avoid a customer surcharge for the roughly $260 million of storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Dorian. In addition to low bills, FPL delivered its best-ever service reliability performance in 2019 and was named the winner of the 2019 ReliabilityOneTM National Reliability Excellence Award, presented by PA Consulting, for the fourth time in five years.

In 2019, FPL successfully executed on its ongoing capital plan, including bringing online the highly efficient Okeechobee Clean Energy Center and an additional 300 megawatts (MW) of cost-effective solar on time and on budget. Construction on an additional 10 solar sites, totaling nearly 750 MW of combined capacity, remain on track and on budget to begin providing cost-effective energy to FPL customers in early 2020. These projects are part of FPL's groundbreaking "30-by-30" plan, which is one of the world's largest solar expansions and will result in approximately 10,000 MW of incremental solar capacity on FPL's system. This solar expansion combined with low-cost battery storage solutions, such as the Manatee Energy Storage Center that was announced during the year, represent the next phase of FPL's generation modernization efforts and are expected to further reduce FPL's CO2 emissions rate, which is already among the lowest in the nation and has declined more than 30% since 2005.

Beyond solar, construction on the highly efficient, roughly 1,200-MW Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance toward its projected commercial operation date in 2022.

In addition, after an extensive and thorough 18-month review, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted Turkey Point units 3 and 4 their second 20-year license extensions. These units are the first nuclear power units in the U.S. to achieve this milestone, and this decision supports the continued production of clean, zero-emission, reliable and affordable nuclear power in Florida for many years to come.

Gulf Power Company

Gulf Power, a rate-regulated electric utility that serves approximately 470,000 customers in eight counties throughout northwest Florida, reported fourth-quarter 2019 net income on a GAAP basis of $23 million, or $0.05 per share. On an adjusted basis, Gulf Power's earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $26 million, or $0.05 per share. For the full year 2019, Gulf Power reported net income on a GAAP basis of $180 million, or $0.37 per share. On an adjusted basis, Gulf Power's earnings for the full year 2019 were $200 million, or $0.41 per share.

The Gulf Power integration continues to progress well, and the team remains focused on improving the customer value proposition by reducing costs and making smart capital investments for the benefit of customers. In the first year of ownership, Gulf Power reduced its O&M costs by approximately 20%, while investing approximately $730 million to support regulatory capital employed growth of 11% year-over-year. Gulf Power customers are already beginning to benefit as the company achieved its best-ever service reliability year, which was approximately 20% better than 2018.

The approximately 75-MW Blue Indigo Solar Energy Center, Gulf Power's first solar development project, is expected to go into service later this quarter and generate significant customer savings over its lifetime. All of the other major capital investments, including the North Florida Resiliency Connection and the Plant Crist coal-to-natural gas conversion, continue to remain on track.

During the fourth quarter of 2019, Gulf Power's average number of customers increased slightly from the prior-year comparable quarter.

NextEra Energy Resources 

NextEra Energy Resources, the competitive energy and rate-regulated transmission businesses of NextEra Energy, reported a fourth-quarter 2019 contribution to net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $433 million, or $0.88 per share, compared to $264 million, or $0.55 per share, in the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources' earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $326 million, or $0.66 per share, compared to $323 million, or $0.67 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2018. For the full year 2019, NextEra Energy Resources reported net income attributable to NextEra Energy on a GAAP basis of $1.807 billion, or $3.72 per share, compared to $4.704 billion, or $9.82 per share, in 2018. On an adjusted basis, NextEra Energy Resources' earnings for the full year 2019 were $1.695 billion, or $3.49 per share, compared to $1.498 billion, or $3.14 per share, for the full year 2018.

In 2019, NextEra Energy Resources continued to advance its position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects, commissioning approximately 2,700 MW of renewables projects in the U.S., including repowering. The team extended its long track record of renewables origination success, adding more than 5,800 MW to the backlog over the past year. Since the third-quarter financial results call in late October, the team added 1,609 MW of renewables projects to the backlog, including approximately 500 MW of combined wind and repowering, 770 MW of solar and 340 MW of battery storage, all of which will be paired with new solar projects.

Corporate and Other

In the fourth quarter of 2019 on a GAAP basis, Corporate and Other earnings increased $0.77 per share, compared to the prior-year quarter. On an adjusted basis, Corporate and Other earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019 declined $0.05 compared to the prior-year quarter. For the full year 2019, Corporate and Other earnings decreased $0.65 per share on a GAAP basis, compared to 2018. On an adjusted basis, Corporate and Other earnings for the full year 2019 decreased $0.35 per share, compared to 2018. 

Outlook 

NextEra Energy's financial expectations, which were extended last year through 2022, remain unchanged. NextEra Energy continues to expect its adjusted earnings per share compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021, off the 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $7.70, plus accretion of $0.15 and $0.20 in 2020 and 2021, respectively, from the Florida acquisitions. For 2020, NextEra Energy continues to expect its adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $8.70 to $9.20. For 2022, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8%, off 2021 adjusted earnings per share, translating to a range of $10.00 to $10.75 per share.

NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings expectations exclude the cumulative effect of adopting new accounting standards; the effects of non-qualifying hedges and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in NextEra Energy Resources' nuclear decommissioning funds and OTTI, none of which can be determined at this time. Adjusted earnings expectations also exclude the effects of transitional impacts of tax reform, including the impact on differential membership interests; NextEra Energy Partners, LP net investment gains; the financial results from the Spain solar projects; and acquisition-related expenses. In addition, adjusted earnings expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions; continued recovery of the national and the Florida economy; supportive commodity markets; current forward curves; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion to support wind and solar development; market demand for pipeline capacity; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; no divestitures other than to NextEra Energy Partners, LP or acquisitions; no adverse litigation decisions; and no changes to governmental tax policy or incentives. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results.
