ROBERT HALF REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER AND YEAR-END FINANCIAL RESULTS

MENLO PARK, Calif., January 30, 2020 — Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE symbol: RHI) today reported revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2019. 

For the quarter ended December 31, 2019, net income was $113 million, or $.98 per share, on revenues of $1.537 billion. Net income for the prior year’s fourth quarter was $114 million, or $.95 per share, on revenues of $1.482 billion.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, net income was $454 million, or $3.90 per share, on revenues of $6.074 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net income was $434 million, or $3.57 per share, on revenues of $5.800 billion.

“We ended 2019 with continued strength in the U.S. job market and solid demand for our professional staffing and consulting services,” said M. Keith Waddell, Chief Executive Officer of Robert Half. “We are particularly pleased with how Protiviti performed during the quarter. Our Robert Half Technology and Robert Half Management Resources divisions also turned in solid results, largely due to ongoing talent shortages in the professional disciplines they serve.”

Waddell added, “Return on invested capital for the company was 40 percent in the fourth quarter.”

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The financial results of Robert Half International Inc. (the “Company”) are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). To help readers understand the Company’s financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with revenue growth rates derived from non-GAAP revenue amounts.

Variations in the Company’s financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, billing days, and certain intercompany adjustments. The Company provides “as adjusted” revenue growth calculations to remove the impact of these items. These calculations show the year-over-year revenue growth rates for the Company’s lines of business on both a reported basis and also on an as adjusted basis for global, U.S., and international operations. This information is presented for each of the six most recent quarters. The Company has provided this data because it focuses on the Company’s revenue growth rates attributable to operating activities and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time. The Company expresses year-over-year revenue changes as calculated percentages using the same number of billing days, constant currency exchange rates, and certain intercompany adjustments.

The non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to actual revenue growth derived from revenue amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided on the following pages.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

REVENUE GROWTH RATES (%) (UNAUDITED):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The non-GAAP financial measures included in the table above adjust for the following items:

Foreign Currency Translation. The “As Reported” revenue growth rates are based upon reported revenues, which include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to calculate “Constant Currency” revenue growth rates, as-reported amounts are retranslated using foreign exchange rates from the prior year’s comparable period.

Billing Days. The “As Reported” revenue growth rates are based upon reported revenues. Management calculates a global, weighted-average number of billing days for each reporting period based upon inputs from all countries and all lines of business. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billing days, the company calculates “same billing day” revenue growth rates by dividing each comparative period’s reported revenues by the calculated number of billing days for that period to arrive at a “per billing day” amount. The “same billing day” growth rates are then calculated based upon the “per billing day” amounts.

Intercompany Adjustments. The “As Reported” revenue growth rates are based upon reported revenues. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by the impact of certain intercompany adjustments, applicable comparative period revenues are reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.

The term “As Adjusted” means that the impact of different billing days, constant currency fluctuations, and certain intercompany adjustments are removed from the revenue growth rate calculation. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP year-over-year revenue growth rates to the “As Reported” year-over-year revenue growth rates is included herein on Pages 8-10.
