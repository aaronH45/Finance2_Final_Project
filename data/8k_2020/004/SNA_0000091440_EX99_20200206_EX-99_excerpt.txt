 “We are encouraged by our progress in strengthening our operations in 2019 despite ongoing headwinds from unfavorable currency and economic challenges in certain geographies throughout the year,” said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on chairman and chief executive officer. “Our results have demonstrated progress along a number of our runways for growth, including within our U.S. franchise network, and reflected the effectiveness of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes to help mitigate the headwinds. Finally, as we begin 2020, our 100th anniversary year, I want to thank our franchisees and associates for their ongoing contributions and to recognize their capabilities and commitment in making our progress possible now and in the future.”  

 Segment Results - Fourth Quarter  

 Commercial & Industrial Group segment sales of $352.9 million in the quarter increased $9.2 million, or 2.7%, from 2018 levels, reflecting an $11.8 million, or 3.5%, organic sales gain and $0.9 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase includes higher sales in the segment’s power tools and Asia Pacific operations, as well as increases with customers in critical industries, partially offset by lower sales in the segment's European-based hand tools business.  

 Operating earnings of $45.0 million in the period, including $0.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $50.8 million in 2018, while the operating margin (operating earnings as a percentage of segment sales) of 12.8% compared to 14.8% a year ago.  

 Snap-on Tools Group segment sales of $411.7 million in the quarter increased $4.3 million, or 1.1%, from 2018 levels, reflecting a $5.3 million, or 1.3%, organic sales gain, partially offset by $1.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase includes higher sales in the U.S. van network, partially offset by a decrease in the segment’s international operations.  

 Operating earnings of $54.3 million in the period, including $1.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $2.7 million from 2018 levels, and the operating margin of 13.2% compared to 14.0% last year.  

 Repair Systems & Information Group segment sales of $335.0 million in the quarter decreased $4.9 million, or 1.4%, from 2018 levels, reflecting a $5.2 million, or 1.5%, organic sales decline and $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $2.6 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic decrease includes lower sales to OEM dealerships, partially offset by higher sales of undercar equipment and increased sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers.  

 Operating earnings of $87.2 million in the period, including $0.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $87.4 million in 2018, while the operating margin of 26.0% compared to 25.7% a year ago.

 Outlook  

 As Snap-on enters its 100th anniversary year, the company expects to make continued progress in 2020 along its defined runways for coherent growth, leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base, not only in automotive repair, but in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including extending in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. In pursuit of these initiatives, Snap-on expects that capital expenditures in 2020 will be in a range of $90 million to $100 million.  

 Snap-on currently anticipates that its full year 2020 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%.

 Non-GAAP Measures  

 References in this document to “organic sales” refer to sales from continuing operations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), adjusted to exclude acquisition-related sales and the impact of foreign currency translation. Management evaluates the company’s sales performance based on organic sales growth, which primarily reflects growth from the company’s existing businesses as a result of increased output, customer base and geographic expansion, new product development and/or pricing, and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prior-year reporting period. The company’s organic sales disclosures also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in our businesses and facilitates comparisons of our sales performance with prior periods.  

 For the full year 2019, the company is including operating earnings before financial services, consolidated operating earnings, net earnings and diluted earnings per share, all as adjusted to exclude the impact of an $11.6 million benefit ($8.7 million after tax) from the 2019 legal settlement, which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  

 For the fourth quarter and full year 2018, the company is including operating earnings before financial services, consolidated operating earnings, net earnings and diluted earnings per share, all as adjusted to exclude the impact of a $4.3 million benefit ($3.2 million after tax) from the 2018 legal settlement. In addition, for the full year 2018, the company is including net earnings and diluted earnings per share, both as adjusted to exclude a net gain of $5.5 million ($4.1 million after tax) associated with a treasury lock settlement gain of $13.3 million related to the issuance of debt, partially offset by a $7.8 million expense related to the early extinguishment of debt, both of which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Finally, for the full year 2018, the company is including net earnings, diluted earnings per share and its effective tax rate, all as adjusted to exclude the impact of a $3.9 million charge related to the implementation of U.S. tax legislation.  

 Management believes that these are unusual events and therefore the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude them provide more meaningful year-over-year comparisons of the company’s 2019 operating performance. For a reconciliation of the adjusted metrics, see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
