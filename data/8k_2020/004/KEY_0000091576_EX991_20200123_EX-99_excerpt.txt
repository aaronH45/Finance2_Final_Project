CLEVELAND, January 23, 2020 - KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $439 million, or $.45 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $383 million, or $.38 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2019 and $459 million, or $.45 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2018. Key’s fourth quarter 2019 diluted earnings per share was $.48(a), excluding $.03 per diluted common share related to a previously disclosed fraud and a pension settlement charge. Key's results in the third quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018 also included notable items; additional detail can be found on page 24 of this release.

"Key’s fourth quarter results marked a good finish to another strong year for our company. We achieved our seventh consecutive year of positive operating leverage, supported by solid balance sheet growth, continued momentum in our fee-based businesses and strong expense control. Across our company, we continued to add and expand client relationships, which drove growth in loans, deposits and fees.

Our ongoing focus on expense management and continuous improvement resulted in lower expenses for the year and a 140 basis point improvement in our cash efficiency ratio, excluding notable items. While we have continued to reduce costs, we remain committed to making strategic investments that will drive future growth and returns. Our recent investments in talent, products and capabilities, including our Laurel Road acquisition in April of last year, have exceeded our expectations, benefiting our top line growth, improving the client experience and driving efficiency.

Strong risk management and being disciplined with our capital have also remained top priorities. Credit quality trends remained solid this quarter, and we continue to be diligent in our credit underwriting. We have also returned capital to our shareholders throughout the year in the form of share repurchases and a 9% increase in our common stock dividend.

Our CEO transition continues to progress smoothly, and we remain very confident in the way we have positioned Key for the future. We fully expect to continue on the path to achieve our long-term targets and drive improved returns."

 - Beth Mooney, Chairman & CEO

(a)The table entitled “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” in the attached financial supplement presents the computations of certain financial measures related to “Return on average tangible common equity from continuing operations.” The table reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons.

(b)12/31/19 ratio is estimated.

TE = Taxable Equivalent, N/A = Not Applicable

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

TE = Taxable Equivalent

Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $987 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $1.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in net interest income reflects a lower net interest margin, which was partially offset by an increase in earning asset balances. The net interest margin was impacted by a lag in deposit pricing as interest rates moved lower. Additionally, purchase accounting accretion declined $8 million.

Compared to the third quarter of 2019, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $7 million. The increase was driven by higher earning asset balances, partially offset by a slight decline in the net interest margin. The net interest margin reflected lower earning asset yields and the benefit of lower interest-bearing deposit costs.

Key’s noninterest income was $651 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $645 million for the year-ago quarter. The increase reflects higher operating lease income, as well as growth in corporate services income, driven by higher derivatives income. Investments made in Key's mortgage business continue to drive consumer mortgage income and mortgage servicing fees.

Compared to the third quarter of 2019, noninterest income increased by $1 million, due to growth in investment banking and debt placement fees, related to an increase in commercial mortgage income, as well as seasonally higher corporate-owned life insurance income. The increase was partially offset by lower other income.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Key’s noninterest expense was $980 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $1.0 billion in the year-ago quarter and $939 million in the prior quarter. The fourth quarter of 2019 included notable items of $22 million, which consist of a pension settlement charge and professional fees related to a previously disclosed fraud loss. The year-ago period included notable items of $41 million, which were efficiency-related expenses and a pension settlement charge, while no notable items were reported in the prior period.

Excluding notable items, noninterest expense decreased by $13 million from the year-ago period, reflecting the successful implementation of Key's expense initiatives, which drove personnel expenses lower. These expenses were partially offset by additional expenses from Laurel Road, which was acquired in April 2019.

Noninterest expense increased $41 million from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily driven by notable items in the quarter - a pension settlement charge of $18 million and professional fees related to a previously disclosed fraud loss of $4 million, as well as seasonally higher business and professional fees and an increase in incentive compensation, driven by higher stock-based compensation related to a quarterly increase in share price.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Average loans were $93.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $4.3 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Commercial loans increased $1.6 billion, reflecting broad-based growth in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by declines in commercial mortgage and construction loans. Consumer loans increased $2.7 billion, driven by solid growth from Laurel Road, residential mortgage loans, and indirect auto lending.

Average deposits totaled $112.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $4.7 billion compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting growth from consumer and commercial relationships.

Compared to the third quarter of 2019, average deposits increased by $2.3 billion, primarily driven by short-term and seasonal commercial deposits.

N/A = Not Applicable

In the fourth quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2019, Key realized pre-tax losses related to a previously disclosed fraud incident of $16 million and $123 million, respectively. Excluding the fraud losses, Key’s provision for credit losses was $93 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $59 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and $77 million for the third quarter of 2019. Key’s allowance for loan and lease losses was $900 million, or .95% of total period-end loans at December 31, 2019, compared to .99% at December 31, 2018, and .96% at September 30, 2019.

Excluding the fraud loss, net loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled $83 million, or .35% of average total loans. These results compare to $60 million, or .27%, for the fourth quarter of 2018, and $73 million, or .31%, for the third quarter of 2019.

At December 31, 2019, Key’s nonperforming loans totaled $577 million, which represented .61% of period-end portfolio loans. These results compare to .61% at December 31, 2018, and .63% at September 30, 2019. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2019, totaled $715 million, and represented .75% of period-end portfolio loans and OREO and other nonperforming assets. These results compare to .64% at December 31, 2018, and .77% at September 30, 2019.

CAPITAL

Key’s estimated risk-based capital ratios included in the following table continued to exceed all “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks at December 31, 2019.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)12/31/2019 ratio is estimated.

(b)The table entitled “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” in the attached financial supplement presents the computations of certain financial measures related to “tangible common equity.” The table reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons. See below for further information on the Regulatory Capital Rules. 

Key's capital position remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2019. As shown in the preceding table, at December 31, 2019, Key’s estimated Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios stood at 9.43% and 10.85%, respectively. Key's tangible common equity ratio was 8.64% at December 31, 2019. 

As a “standardized approach” banking organization, Key’s mandatory compliance with the final Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Regulatory Capital Rules”) began on January 1, 2015, subject to transitional provisions. Key’s estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio as calculated under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules was 9.35% at December 31, 2019. This estimate exceeds the fully phased-in required minimum Common Equity Tier 1 and Capital Conservation Buffer of 7.00%.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Consistent with Key's 2019 Capital Plan, during the fourth quarter of 2019, Key declared a dividend of $.185 per common share. Key also completed $241 million of common share repurchases during the quarter.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations

(dollars in millions)

The table below presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to “tangible common equity,” “return on average tangible common equity,” “Common Equity Tier 1,” “pre-provision net revenue," “cash efficiency ratio," "earnings per common share excluding notable items," "net loan charge-offs to average loans excluding notable items," and "provision for credit losses excluding notable items."

Notable items include certain revenue or expense items that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of ongoing financial performance. Management believes it is useful to consider certain financial metrics with and without notable items, in order to enable a better understanding of company results, increase comparability of period-to-period results, and to evaluate and forecast those results.

The tangible common equity ratio and the return on average tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing Key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. In October 2013, the federal banking regulators published the final Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Regulatory Capital Rules”). The Regulatory Capital Rules require higher and better-quality capital and introduced a new capital measure, “Common Equity Tier 1,” a non-GAAP financial measure. The mandatory compliance date for Key as a “standardized approach” banking organization began on January 1, 2015, subject to transitional provisions. 

The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for credit losses makes it easier to analyze the results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.

The cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-GAAP performance measures. As such, there is no directly comparable GAAP performance measure. The cash efficiency ratio performance measure removes the impact of Key’s intangible asset amortization from the calculation. Management believes this ratio provide greater consistency and comparability between Key’s results and those of its peer banks. Additionally, this ratio is used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis. 

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.
