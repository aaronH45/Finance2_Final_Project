Fiscal 2020 Guidance:

•Reaffirmed fiscal 2020 Adjusted Earnings per diluted share guidance range of $14.60 to $14.80; previously raised from $14.00 to $14.60 on January 13, 2020.

IRVING, Texas, February 4, 2020 - McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) today reported results for the third quarter ended December 31, 2019. 

Fiscal 2020 Third-Quarter and Year-to-Date Result Summary

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

“We delivered solid operating performance and we are pleased to report third-quarter adjusted earnings results ahead of our expectations,” said Brian Tyler, chief executive officer. “McKesson’s unwavering focus on strategic and operational execution is demonstrated in the adjusted operating profit growth we reported in the third quarter across our core operating segments. Additionally, we have deployed meaningful capital toward share repurchases year-to-date, delivering further value to our shareholders. Our outlook for fiscal 2020 Adjusted EPS remains unchanged from the prior guidance we provided on January 13th, 2020.” 

Third-quarter revenues were $59.2 billion, up 5% from a year ago. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenues grew 6%, primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, largely due to branded pharmaceutical price increases and higher volumes from retail national account customers.

Third-quarter earnings per diluted share of $1.06 included a pre- and post-tax charge of $282 million within our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment for the remeasurement to fair value of assets and liabilities held for sale related to the expected formation of a new German wholesale joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance.

Third-quarter Adjusted Earnings per diluted share was $3.81 compared to $3.40 a year ago, an increase of 12%, primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, Medical Surgical and European segments and a lower share count, partially offset by the previously anticipated increase in corporate expenses and a higher tax rate. Prior year third-quarter results included a pre-tax charge of $60 million related to a customer bankruptcy, partially offset by a $17 million pre-tax reversal of an accrued estimated liability related to the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act. Excluding the impact of these prior year items from Adjusted Earnings, third-quarter adjusted results per diluted share increased approximately 7% year-over-year.

For the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson returned $2.2 billion of cash to shareholders via $1.9 billion of common stock repurchases and $222 million of dividend payments. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, McKesson used cash from operations of $280 million, and invested $338 million internally, resulting in negative free cash flow of $618 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

GAAP refers to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This press release includes GAAP financial measures as well as Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Earnings, FX-Adjusted results and Free Cash Flow which are financial measures not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Refer to the “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of the accompanying financial statement tables for the definitions and usefulness of the Company’s Non-GAAP financial measures and the attached schedules for reconciliations of the differences between the Non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

The company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as McKesson is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, without unreasonable effort, because McKesson cannot reliably forecast LIFO inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment and related charges, and other adjustments, which are difficult to predict and estimate. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control, and as such, any associated estimate and its impact on GAAP performance could vary materially.

Cautionary Statements

Except for historical information contained in this press release, matters discussed may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in those statements. It is not possible to identify all such risks and uncertainties. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, such as references to the expected joint venture in Germany, which speak only as of the date they are first made. Except to the extent required by law, the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may be identified by their use of terminology such as “believes”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “seeks”, “approximately”, “intends”, “plans”, “estimates” or the negative of these words or other comparable terminology. The discussion of financial trends, strategy, plans, assumptions or intentions may also include forward-looking statements. We encourage investors to read the important risk factors described in the company’s Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risk factors include, but are not limited to: changes in the healthcare industry and regulatory environment; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the impact of the Change Healthcare joint venture on the company’s results of operations; the company’s ability to manage and complete divestitures and distributions; material adverse resolution of pending legal proceedings, including those related to the distribution of controlled substances; cyberattack, natural disaster, or malfunction of sophisticated internal computer systems to perform as designed; and the potential inadequacy of insurance to cover property loss or liability claims.

McKESSON CORPORATION

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company's financial results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), McKesson Corporation (the "Company" or "we") also presents the following Non-GAAP measures in this press release. The Company believes the presentation of Non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors with regard to its operating performance, as well as assists with the comparison of its past financial performance to the Company’s future financial results. Moreover, the Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures assists investors’ ability to compare its financial results to those of other companies in the same industry. However, the Company's Non-GAAP measures used in the press tables may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in the same industry.

•Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP): We define Adjusted Earnings as GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to McKesson, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, transaction-related expenses and adjustments, last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) inventory-related adjustments, gains from antitrust legal settlements, restructuring, impairment and related charges, other adjustments as well as the related income tax effects for each of these items, as applicable. The Company evaluates its definition of Adjusted Earnings on a periodic basis and updates the definition from time to time. The evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Earnings. A reconciliation of McKesson’s GAAP financial results to Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedules 2 and 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles - Amortization expenses of intangible assets directly related to business combinations and the formation of joint ventures.

Transaction-related expenses and adjustments - Transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business combinations, the formation of joint ventures, divestitures and other transaction-related costs including initial public offering costs. Examples include transaction closing costs, professional service fees, legal fees, severance charges, retention payments and employee relocation expenses, facility or other exit-related expenses, certain fair value adjustments including deferred revenues, contingent consideration and inventory, recoveries of acquisition-related expenses or post-closing expenses, bridge loan fees, and gains or losses on business combinations and divestitures of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations.

LIFO inventory-related adjustments - LIFO inventory-related non-cash expense or credit adjustments.

Gains from antitrust legal settlements - Net cash proceeds representing the Company’s share of antitrust lawsuit settlements.

Restructuring, impairment and related charges - Restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted as well as long-lived asset impairments. Such charges may include employee severance, retention bonuses, facility closure or consolidation costs, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The restructuring programs may be implemented due to the sale or discontinuation of a product line, reorganization or management structure changes, headcount rationalization, realignment of operations or products, integration of acquired businesses, and/or company-wide cost saving initiatives. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring charges are not part of our underlying business, which include normal levels of reinvestment in the business. Any credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates are also excluded from Adjusted Earnings.

Other adjustments - The Company evaluates the nature and significance of transactions qualitatively and quantitatively on an individual basis and may include them in the determination of our Adjusted Earnings from time to time. While not all-inclusive, other adjustments may include: adjustments to claim and litigation reserves for estimated probable losses and settlements; other asset impairments; certain discrete benefits and subsequent true-up adjustments related to the December 2017 enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; gains or losses from debt extinguishment; and other similar substantive and/or infrequent items as deemed appropriate. Prior to fiscal 2020, this category also included certain gains or losses from divestitures of businesses that did not qualify as discontinued operations.

Income taxes on Adjusted Earnings are calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, “Income Taxes,” which is the same accounting principle used by the Company when presenting its GAAP financial results.

Additionally, the Company's investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture's financial results are adjusted for the above noted items, except for the effect of potentially dilutive securities issued by the joint venture on our adjusted earnings per diluted share.

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION (continued)

•FX-Adjusted (Non-GAAP): McKesson also presents its financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis. To present our financial results on an FX-Adjusted basis, we convert current year period results of our operations in foreign countries, which are recorded in local currencies, into U.S. dollars by applying the average foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year period. To present Adjusted Earnings per diluted share on an FX-Adjusted basis, we estimate the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the Company’s noncontrolling interests and adjusted income tax expense, which may vary from quarter to quarter. The supplemental FX-Adjusted information of the Company’s GAAP financial results and Adjusted Earnings (Non-GAAP) is provided in Schedule 3 of the financial statement tables included with this release.

•Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP): We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less payments for property, plant and equipment and capitalized software expenditures, as disclosed in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. For the nine months ended December 31, 2019, free cash flow was $(618) million, calculated as $(280) million net cash used in operating activities less $(242) million in payments for property, plant and equipment and $(96) million in payments for capitalized software expenditures. For the nine months ended December 31, 2018, free cash flow was $(264) million, calculated as $141 million net cash provided by operating activities less $(309) million in payments for property, plant and equipment and $(96) million in payments for capitalized software expenditures. We believe free cash flow is important to management and useful to investors as a supplemental measure as it indicates the cash flow available for working capital needs, re-investment opportunities, strategic acquisitions, dividend payments or other strategic uses of cash.

The Company internally uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own financial planning and reporting processes. Specifically, Adjusted Earnings serves as one of the measures management utilizes when allocating resources, deploying capital and assessing business performance and employee incentive compensation. The Company conducts its businesses internationally in local currencies, including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We present FX-Adjusted information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the estimated effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Nonetheless, Non-GAAP financial results and related measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures as determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.
