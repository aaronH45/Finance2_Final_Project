COLUMBUS, IND. - Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI) today reported results for the fourth quarter of 2019.

Fourth quarter revenues of $5.6 billion decreased 9 percent from the same quarter in 2018. Lower truck production in North America and weaker demand in global construction, mining, and power generation markets drove the majority of the revenue decrease. Currency negatively impacted revenues by 1 percent primarily due to a stronger US dollar. 

Fourth quarter sales in North America declined by 8 percent while international revenues decreased by 10 percent led by declines in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and India.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the fourth quarter were $563 million (10.1 percent of sales), or $682 million (12.2 percent of sales) excluding restructuring, compared to $896 million (14.6 percent of sales) a year ago. 

“After a strong start to 2019, demand declined across most geographies and end markets in the second half of the year,” said Tony Satterthwaite, President and Chief Operating Officer. “We moved quickly to align costs with the weaker global outlook, executing a number of actions which we expect to yield annual savings of $250 to $300 million.”

The Company executed several measures to reduce costs and improve future performance in the second half of 2019. These actions included a plan to reduce headcount, which resulted in a charge of $119 million ($90 million after tax) in the fourth quarter.

Net income attributable to Cummins in the fourth quarter was $300 million ($1.97 per diluted share), or $390 million ($2.56 per diluted share) excluding restructuring, compared to $579 million ($3.63 per

diluted share) in 2018. In addition to the restructuring costs, fourth quarter net income included charges of $22 million ($0.14 per diluted share) related to the cessation of development and production of certain products in North America and our planned exit of a business in Africa. The tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17.9 percent.

Revenues for the full year were $23.6 billion, 1 percent lower than 2018. Revenues in North America increased 3 percent and international sales declined 6 percent led by lower demand in Europe and India.

EBITDA for the year was a record $3.6 billion (15.3 percent of sales), or $3.7 billion (15.8 percent of sales) excluding restructuring. This compares to $3.5 billion or 14.6 percent of sales in 2018.

Net income attributable to Cummins for the full year was $2.3 billion ($14.48 per diluted share), or $2.4 billion ($15.05 per diluted share) excluding restructuring, compared to net income of $2.1 billion ($13.15 per diluted share) in 2018. The tax rate for the full year was 20 percent.

“Despite challenging conditions in many of our largest markets over the last six months, Cummins delivered record profits and operating cash flow in 2019,” said Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger. “The actions we have taken to reduce costs will mitigate a further slowdown in 2020 and position the Company for stronger performance when market demand improves. We will continue investment in new technologies and products in 2020 to generate strong growth and profitability for the company in both the near and long term, which is consistent with how we have managed through prior cycles.”

2020 Outlook:

Based on the current forecast, Cummins projects full year 2020 revenues to be down 8 to 12 percent, and EBITDA to be in the range of 14.2 to 15.2 percent of sales. Revenue declines in 2020 are driven by lower truck production in North America, Europe, China, and India as well as lower projected demand in off-highway markets, including global Power Generation, mining, oil and gas, and construction markets. The midpoint of guidance represents a 25 percent decremental EBITDA margin excluding the impact of the New Power segment.

The company plans to return 75 percent of Operating Cash Flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.

Our outlook does not include any potential impact of the company’s review of its emission certification process and compliance with emission standards or additional expenses associated with executing future cost reduction initiatives.

2019 Highlights:

•The Company returned a record $2.0 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased 8.1 million shares, representing 5.2 percent of shares outstanding. 

•Cummins closed on its previously announced acquisition of fuel cell and hydrogen production technologies provider Hydrogenics Corporation.

•Announced Cummins new environmental sustainability strategy called PLANET 2050 which includes science based goals that meet or exceed the goals in the United Nations Paris agreement on climate change. 

•Cummins was ranked No. 17 in Newsweek magazine’s first rating of America’s Most Responsible Companies, the highest ranked company in the automotive and component category.

•Launched the Company’s new 2020 X15 Efficiency Series engine which meets 2021 greenhouse gas standards one year early in North America, delivering up to 5 percent better fuel economy than the prior X15 Efficiency Series. The X15 Efficiency Series is paired with a 12-speed Cummins Eaton Joint Venture Automated Manual Transmission and delivers both improved fuel economy and reliability for customers, while lowering greenhouse gas emissions.

•The first Cummins-powered battery electric bus entered service in Santa Monica, California.

Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Information

EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used in this release, and is defined and reconciled to what management believes to be the most comparable GAAP measure in a schedule attached to this release. Cummins presents this information as it believes it is useful to understanding the Company's operating performance, and because EBITDA is a measure used internally to assess the performance of the operating units.

We believe net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. excluding restructuring charges is a useful measure of our operating performance without regard to restructuring charges. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for GAAP and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS 

In November 2019, we announced our intentions to reduce our global workforce in response to the continued deterioration in our global markets in the second half of 2019, as well as expected reductions in orders in most U.S. and international markets in 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we began executing restructuring actions, primarily in the form of voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs. To the extent these programs involve voluntary separations, a liability is generally recorded at the time offers to employees are accepted. To the extent these programs provide separation benefits in accordance with pre-existing agreements or policies, a liability is recorded once the amount is probable and reasonably estimable. We incurred a charge of $119 million ($90 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2019 for these actions which impacted approximately 2,300 employees. The voluntary actions were completed by December 31, 2019 and the majority of the involuntary actions were executed prior to January 31, 2020, with expected completion by March 31, 2020. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates. 

INCOME TAXES 

Our effective tax rates for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, were 17.9 percent and 20.0 percent, respectively.

The three months ended December 31, 2019, contained $4 million of favorable net discrete tax items, primarily due to withholding taxes and provision to return adjustments. The year ended December 31, 2019, contained $34 million of favorable net discrete tax items, primarily due to withholding taxes and provision to return adjustments.

FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP

(Unaudited)

Reconciliation of Non GAAP measures - Earnings before interest, income taxes, noncontrolling interests, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)

We believe EBITDA is a useful measure of our operating performance as it assists investors and debt holders in comparing our performance on a consistent basis without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or depreciation and amortization methods, which can vary significantly depending upon many factors.

EBITDA is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. It should be considered supplemental data; however, the amounts included in the EBITDA calculation are derived from amounts included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income. Below is a reconciliation of “Net income attributable to Cummins Inc.” to EBITDA for each of the applicable periods:
