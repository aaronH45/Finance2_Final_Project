 FOURTH QUARTER 2019 RESULTS  

 REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION  

 Wallingford, Connecticut. January 22, 2020. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE: APH) reported today GAAP diluted Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) for the fourth quarter 2019 of $1.03 compared to $1.09 for the comparable 2018 period. GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter 2019 included an excess tax benefit of approximately $17 million ($0.05 per share) related to stock options exercised during the quarter. In the fourth quarter 2018, GAAP Diluted EPS included (i) a benefit of approximately $15 million ($0.04 per share) resulting from the finalization of the provisional income tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter 2017 related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) and (ii) an excess tax benefit of $6 million ($0.02 per share) related to stock options exercised, partially offset by (iii) acquisition-related transaction costs of $9 million ($0.02 per share). Excluding the effect of these items, Adjusted Diluted EPS1 for the fourth quarter 2019 was $0.98 compared to $1.05 for the fourth quarter 2018.   

 Sales for the fourth quarter 2019 were $2.151 billion compared to $2.225 billion for the comparable 2018 period. Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $14 million in the fourth quarter 2019 compared to the 2018 period.  

 For the year ended December 31, 2019, GAAP Diluted EPS was $3.75, compared to $3.85 in 2018. GAAP Diluted EPS in 2019 included (i) an excess tax benefit of $38 million ($0.12 per share) related to stock options exercised during the period, partially offset by (ii) acquisition-related costs of approximately $25 million ($0.07 per share) and (iii) refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt during the period of $14 million ($0.04 per share). In the comparable 2018 period, GAAP Diluted EPS included (i) the previously mentioned benefit resulting from the finalization of the provisional income tax charge related to the Tax Act and (ii) an excess tax benefit of $20 million ($0.06 per share) related to stock options exercised during the period, partially offset by (iii) the previously mentioned acquisition-related transaction costs. Excluding the effect of these items, Adjusted Diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $3.74 and $3.77, respectively.  

 Sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 were a record $8.225 billion, which compared to $8.202 billion for the 2018 period. Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $126 million in 2019 compared to 2018.  

 Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated, “We are very pleased to close 2019 with both fourth quarter sales and Adjusted Diluted EPS exceeding the high end of our guidance, reaching $2.151 billion and $0.98, respectively. Compared to the fourth quarter 2018, sales decreased 3% as a result of moderations in the communications-related markets, particularly the mobile devices and mobile networks markets, which were offset in part by strong growth in the military and commercial air markets together with contributions from the Company’s acquisition program. For the full year 2019, sales were up slightly in U.S. dollars, driven by strong growth in the military and commercial air markets as well as contributions from the Company’s acquisition program. This growth was largely offset by reductions in the communications-related markets, in particular the mobile devices market, together with the negative effect of currency translation.”  

 “We are very proud that the Company continues to execute well amidst an uncertain demand environment, with Adjusted Operating Margins reaching 20.0% for both the fourth quarter and full year 2019.”   

 “Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter and full year 2019 was a very strong $424 million and $1.502 billion, respectively, another confirmation of the quality of the Company’s earnings. The Company continues to deploy its financial strength in a variety of ways to increase shareholder value. To that end, the Company purchased 0.4 million shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter for $43 million, bringing total share repurchases in 2019 to 6.5 million shares or $602 million. The Company also paid dividends of $74 million during the fourth quarter, bringing total dividends paid in 2019 to $280 million, resulting in total capital returned to shareholders in 2019 of more than $880 million.”  

 “The Company continues to expand its growth opportunities through a deep commitment to developing enabling technologies for customers in all markets, an ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification and an active and successful acquisition program. We are particularly proud of the Company’s progress in our acquisition program in 2019, with nine new companies joining the Amphenol family. These new family members broaden our product offering, expand our position across our diversified end markets and deepen our pool of talent. As part of that program, we are excited to have closed on the acquisition of EXA Thermometrics India Private Limited (“EXA”) in January. Based in India and with annual sales of approximately $10 million, EXA designs and manufactures temperature sensors for the industrial market. While relatively small in scale, this acquisition bolsters our growing sensor offering and expands our low-cost capabilities for these important products, while bringing another strong management team into the Amphenol family.”   

  “As we look ahead, the overall demand environment continues to reflect a heightened level of uncertainty in the global economy. Given this environment, and assuming current exchange rates, we expect first quarter 2020 sales in the range of $1.960 billion to $2.000 billion and Adjusted Diluted EPS in the range of $0.85 to $0.87. For the full year 2020, we expect sales in the range of $8.240 billion to $8.400 billion, representing flat to 2% growth over 2019, and Adjusted Diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.76 to $3.84, representing 1% to 3% growth over 2019.  

 “While the current demand environment is still challenging, we remain confident in the platform of strength that has been created by the Company’s consistent and strong performance. The electronics revolution continues to create exciting long-term growth opportunities for Amphenol across each of our diversified end markets, with customers driving their products and networks to achieve ever higher levels of performance. We believe these opportunities will drive a long-term increase in demand for our expanded range of high-technology interconnect, sensor and antenna products. Our ongoing actions to leverage our competitive advantages and create sustained financial strength in all economic environments, as well as our initiatives to expand our high-technology product offerings, both organically and through our acquisition program, have created an excellent base for future performance. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding, entrepreneurial management team to dynamically adjust to the always-changing environment, to continue to generate strong profitability and to further capitalize on the many opportunities to expand our market position.”

The following non-GAAP financial measures exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (1)    While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure. 

   (2)    The definitions of non-GAAP financial measures used are as follows: 

 Adjusted Operating Income is defined as Operating Income (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income), excluding income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented.  

 Adjusted Operating Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income (as defined above) expressed as a percentage of Net sales (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income).  

 Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation is defined as Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented.   

 Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as Provision for income taxes (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income) expressed as a percentage of Income before income taxes (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income), each excluding the income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the periods presented.  

 Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the periods presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined above, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares (as reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income).
