DUBLIN (Feb. 18, 2020) - Allegion plc (NYSE: ALLE), a leading global provider of security products and solutions, today reported fourth-quarter 2019 net revenues of $719.5 million and net earnings of $80.7 million, or $0.86 per share. Excluding charges related to restructuring, acquisitions, divestitures and trade name impairments, adjusted net earnings were $119.8 million, or $1.28 per share, up 4.9 percent when compared with fourth-quarter 2018 adjusted EPS of $1.22. Reported net earnings for fourth-quarter 2019 include a $0.34 per share charge for losses related to the divestiture of the company’s business operations in Colombia and Turkey, which were divested during the fourth quarter. The charges were primarily related to non-cash, currency translation adjustments (amounting to $0.28 per share) previously deferred in equity and were reclassified into earnings upon sale of the divested businesses. Reported net earnings for fourth-quarter 2018 include a $0.19 per share benefit related to U.S. Tax Reform.

Fourth-quarter 2019 net revenues increased 2.4 percent when compared to the prior-year period (up 3.5 percent on an organic basis). Organic growth was led by the Americas region, at 6.8 percent, offset by weakness in EMEIA and Asia Pacific. Reported revenues reflect strong pricing and modest volume that more than offset impacts from foreign currency and divestitures.

“I am extremely pleased with Americas’ fourth-quarter performance,” said David D. Petratis, Allegion chairman, president and CEO. “The region delivered strong organic growth and electronics performed well as we continue to see healthy end-market fundamentals there. Conversely, weak market conditions in Australia and softened market conditions across China and Europe during the quarter posed challenges for the other regions.”

Fourth-quarter 2019 operating income was $143.3 million, an increase of $1.9 million or 1.3 percent compared to 2018. Adjusted operating income in fourth-quarter 2019 was $151 million, an increase of $5.8 million or 4 percent compared to 2018.

Fourth-quarter 2019 operating margin was 19.9 percent, compared with 20.1 percent in 2018. The adjusted operating margin in fourth-quarter 2019 was 21 percent, compared with 20.7 percent in 2018. The 30-basis-point increase in adjusted operating margin is attributable to strong performance in the Americas region offsetting pressure experienced in EMEIA and Asia Pacific. 

The Americas segment revenues increased 6.8 percent on both a reported and organic basis. The non-residential and residential businesses grew at similar rates, driving the strong top-line performance. 

The EMEIA segment revenues decreased 5 percent (down 1.5 percent on an organic basis), reflecting soft volume, the impact of the Turkey divestiture and unfavorable currency effects partially offset by price increases.

The Asia-Pacific segment revenues declined 16.6 percent (down 13.4 percent on an organic basis). The revenue change in the quarter was the result of volume declines and unfavorable currency impacts. The drop in organic revenue continues to be driven by market weakness in Australia, particularly in residential end markets, along with weakness experienced in China.

Full-year Results

Full-year 2019 net revenues of $2.85 billion increased 4.5 percent, when compared with the prior year (up 4.6 percent on an organic basis). The impacts related to currency and the Turkey divestiture were almost completely offset by the carryover benefit of acquisitions made during 2018.

Full-year 2019 net earnings were $401.8 million or $4.26 per share, compared with $434.9 million or $4.54 per share for the prior year. Full-year adjusted net earnings were $460.8 million or $4.89 per share, compared with $430.3 million or $4.50 per share in 2018 - an increase of 8.7 percent. Reported EPS for 2019 includes a $0.34 per share charge related to the divestiture of the company’s business operations in Colombia and Turkey. The charges were primarily related to non-cash, currency translation adjustments (amounting to $0.28 per share) previously deferred in equity and were reclassified into earnings upon sale of the divested businesses. Reported EPS for 2018 includes a $0.23 per share benefit related to U.S. Tax Reform.

Full-year 2019 operating margin was 19.8 percent, compared with 19.2 percent in 2018. The adjusted operating margin for full-year 2019 was 20.8 percent, compared with 20.1 percent in 2018. The 70 basis-point adjusted operating margin increase was primarily driven by strong pricing, volume leverage and productivity more than offsetting inflationary pressures and investment spending.

“Allegion’s full-year results again reflect solid performance in revenue, operating margin, EPS and cash flow,” Petratis added. “We continue to drive shareholder value and have taken the necessary steps to deliver on our commitments in 2020.”

Additional Items

Interest expense for fourth-quarter 2019 was $13.3 million, down from $13.7 million for fourth-quarter 2018.

Other expense net for fourth-quarter 2019 was $2.2 million, compared to other expense net of $0.5 million in the same period of 2018.

The company’s effective tax rate for fourth-quarter 2019 was 17.4 percent, compared with negative 4.5 percent in 2018. The fourth-quarter 2018 included a benefit of $18.6 million related to U.S. Tax Reform. The company’s adjusted effective tax rate for fourth-quarter 2019 was 12.8 percent, compared with 10.9 percent in 2018.

Cash Flow and Liquidity

Available cash flow for 2019 was $422.6 million, an increase of $13.9 million versus the prior year. The company ended 2019 with cash and cash equivalents of $355.3 million, as well as total debt of $1,427.7 million.

Share Repurchase and Dividends

During fourth-quarter 2019, the company repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares for approximately $46.3 million under its previously authorized share-repurchase program approved by the company's board of directors in February 2017. As announced on Feb. 6, 2020, Allegion’s board of directors approved an $800 million share repurchase program, which replaced the 2017 authorization. The board of directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per ordinary share of the company, an increase of 18.5 percent over the prior dividend. The dividend is payable March 31, 2020, to shareholders of record on March 17, 2020.

2020 Outlook

The company expects full-year 2020 revenues to increase 3 to 4 percent on a reported basis and 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent organically, when compared with 2019. Revenue growth is expected to be led by the Americas region, at an estimated 4 to 5 percent overall and 4.5 to 5.5 percent on an organic basis.

Full-year 2020 reported EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.00 to $5.10, or $5.10 to $5.20 on an adjusted basis. This reflects an increase of approximately 4 to 6 percent versus adjusted 2019 EPS. The outlook includes incremental investment of approximately $0.15 per share; assumes a full-year adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 16.5 to 17 percent; and assumes an average diluted share count for the full year of approximately 93 million shares.

The company is targeting full-year available cash flow of approximately $450 to $470 million.
