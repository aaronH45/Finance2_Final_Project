“I’m pleased with Principal’s results for the quarter and full year,” said Dan Houston, chairman, president and CEO. “We finished strong with fourth quarter non-GAAP operating earnings of $396 million, which brought full year operating earnings to $1.6 billion. We also delivered $17.3 billion of positive net cash flow in 2019. Our positive net cash, combined with favorable investment performance, led to record AUM of $735 billion. Our past decade is a good story of growth: We’ve delivered positive total company net cash flow in nine of the last ten years.” 

“We continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value through a balanced approach to capital deployment,” added Houston. “In 2019 we deployed $2.1 billion, which was well above our initial target.

On top of that, we returned $863 million to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases.”

Segment Results 

Retirement and Income Solutions - Fee 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ·Pre-tax operating earnings increased $26.1 million as higher net revenue was partially offset by higher operating expenses, including the transition service agreement (TSA) costs associated with the IRT business and $13.7 million of integration expenses. In the year ago quarter, we had unfavorable equity markets which negatively impacted results.  

 ·Net revenue increased $137.2 million primarily due to revenue from the IRT business as well as higher fees and other revenue driven by favorable equity market performance and growth in the legacy businesses.  

Retirement and Income Solutions - Spread 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ·Pre-tax operating earnings decreased $2.5 million primarily due to lower net revenue in the quarter, partially offset by lower commission expense.  

 ·Net revenue decreased $4.1 million due to lower annuity sales and greater experience losses in the current quarter. 

7 Pre-tax operating earnings = operating earnings before income taxes and after noncontrolling interest. 

8 Net revenue = operating revenues less benefits, claims and settlement expenses less dividends to policyholders. 

9 Pre-tax return on net revenue = pre-tax operating earnings divided by net revenue. 

Principal Global Investors 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ·Pre-tax operating earnings increased $41.6 million from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher operating revenues less pass-through expenses and a $12.1 million benefit due to a reduction in an earnout liability, partially offset by higher variable expenses.

Use of Non-GAAP financial measures 

The company uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful to investors because they illustrate the performance of normal, ongoing operations, which is important in understanding and evaluating the company’s financial condition and results of operations. They are not, however, a substitute for U.S. GAAP financial measures. Therefore, the company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure at the end of the release. The company adjusts U.S. GAAP measures for items not directly related to ongoing operations. However, it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP measures for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts.

Summary of Principal Financial Group, Inc. and Segment Results 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

*U.S. GAAP (GAAP) net income attributable to PFG versus non-GAAP operating earnings 

Management uses non-GAAP operating earnings, which is a financial measure that excludes the effect of net realized capital gains and losses, as adjusted, and other after-tax adjustments the company believes are not indicative of overall operating trends, for goal setting, as a basis for determining employee and senior management awards and compensation, and evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by investors and securities analysts. Note: it is possible these adjusting items have occurred in the past and could recur in future reporting periods. While these items may be significant components in understanding and assessing our consolidated financial performance, management believes the presentation of non-GAAP operating earnings enhances the understanding of results of operations by highlighting earnings attributable to the normal, ongoing operations of the company’s businesses.
