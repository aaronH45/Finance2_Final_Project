2019 FULL-YEAR REPORTED DILUTED EPS OF $4.61 VS. $5.08 IN 2018, REFLECTING

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL LIKE-FOR-LIKE ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS GROWTH OF 9.9%;

PROVIDES 2020 EARNINGS PER SHARE FORECAST

NEW YORK, February 6, 2020 – Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE: PM) today announces its 2019 fourth-quarter and full-year results. Comparisons presented in this press release on a "like-for-like" basis reflect pro forma 2018 results, which have been adjusted for the deconsolidation of PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. (RBH), effective March 22, 2019 (the date of deconsolidation). In addition, reflecting the deconsolidation, PMI's total market share has been restated for previous periods.

2019 FULL-YEAR & FOURTH-QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS

•Regular quarterly dividend increase of 2.6% to an annualized rate of $4.68 per common share

•Total IQOS users at year-end estimated at 13.6 million, of which 9.7 million have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS

•IQOS introduced for sale in the U.S. following its marketing order authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 Fourth-Quarter[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Asset impairment and exit costs of approximately $0.20 per share, principally related to a plant closure in Germany as part of global manufacturing infrastructure optimization[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

"2019 marked a year of strong underlying business performance for PMI, driven by broad-based growth for IQOS and solid pricing for our combustible tobacco portfolio, with like-for-like adjusted diluted EPS up by 9.9%, excluding currency," said André Calantzopoulos, Chief Executive Officer.

"We continue to make significant progress in the transformation of our business, with smoke-free products now accounting for 8% of shipment volume and nearly one-fifth of net revenues, while further demonstrating our ability to maintain combustible tobacco leadership internationally, as evidenced by Marlboro’s full-year cigarette share of 10% -- an all-time high."

"Although we anticipate a few temporary headwinds, notably in Indonesia, we enter 2020 with favorable momentum, and expect to deliver like-for-like currency-neutral net revenue and adjusted diluted EPS growth this year consistent with our 2019 to 2021 compound annual growth targets of at least 5% and 8%, as well as further margin expansion."

2020 FULL-YEAR FORECAST

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Reported diluted earnings per share forecast to be at least $5.50, at prevailing exchange rates, representing a projected increase of at least 19% versus reported diluted earnings per share of $4.61 in 2019.

- -2 -

•Excluding an unfavorable currency impact, at prevailing exchange rates, of approximately $0.04 per share, this forecast represents a projected increase of at least 8% versus pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.13 in 2019, as detailed in the above table.

2020 Full-Year Forecast Assumptions

This forecast assumes:

•An estimated total international industry volume decline, excluding China and the U.S., of approximately 3% to 4%, partly reflecting the impact of an above-inflation excise tax increase in Indonesia (following no increase in 2019) and further out-switching to the cigarillo category in Japan, which together account for approximately 100 basis points of the decline;

•A total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume decline for PMI of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% on a like-for-like basis, partly reflecting the same factors as noted above for the total international industry volume decline;

•A full-year heated tobacco unit shipment volume that keeps PMI well on-track to reach its 2021 target of 90 to 100 billion units;

•Currency-neutral net revenue growth, on a like-for-like basis, of approximately 5%;

•An increase in full-year currency-neutral, like-for-like adjusted operating income margin of at least 150 basis points versus 2019, partly reflecting cost efficiencies that fully offset incremental net RRP investment;

•Operating cash flow of approximately $10.5 billion, subject to year-end working capital requirements and currency movements;

•Capital expenditures of approximately $1.0 billion;

•An effective tax rate of approximately 23.0%; and

•No share repurchases.

This forecast excludes the impact of any future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates, further developments related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, further developments pertaining to the judgment in the two Québec Class Action lawsuits and the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) protection granted to RBH, and any unusual events.

Factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections.

Global Collaboration Agreement with KT&G

On January 29, 2020, PMI announced a global collaboration agreement with the leading tobacco and nicotine company in South Korea, KT&G, to commercialize KT&G’s smoke-free products outside of the country. This collaboration serves to accelerate the achievement of PMI's vision of a smoke-free future, by offering adult smokers a broader choice of smoke-free alternatives to cigarettes.

The agreement, which will run for an initial period of three years, allows PMI to distribute current KT&G smoke-free products, and their evolutions, on an exclusive basis, and does not restrict PMI from distributing its own or third-party products. KT&G’s smoke-free product portfolio includes heat-not-burn tobacco products (e.g., Lil Mini and Lil Plus), hybrid technologies that combine heat-not-burn tobacco and e-vapor technologies (e.g., Lil Hybrid), and e-vapor products (e.g., Lil Vapor). 

- -3 -

Products sold under the agreement will be subject to careful assessment to ensure they meet the regulatory requirements in the markets where they are launched, as well as PMI’s high standards of quality and scientific substantiation of their harm reduction potential. PMI and KT&G will seek any necessary regulatory approvals that may be required on a market-by-market basis. 

PMI will be responsible for the commercialization of smoke-free products supplied under the agreement. The agreement does not pertain to the South Korean market or combustible products. There are no current plans to commercialize KT&G products in the U.S.

Conference Call

A conference call, hosted by André Calantzopoulos, Chief Executive Officer, and Martin King, Chief Financial Officer, will be webcast at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on February 6, 2020.

CONSOLIDATED SHIPMENT VOLUME & MARKET SHARE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

- -4 -

Full-Year 

Estimated international industry cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding China and the U.S., of 2.7 trillion, decreased by 2.0%, due to the EU, EE, S&SA, EA&A and LA&C, as described in the Regional sections below.

PMI's total shipment volume decreased by 2.0%, or by 1.4% on a like-for-like basis, due to: 

•Middle East & Africa, primarily reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume, notably in Turkey, partly offset by Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and lower heated tobacco unit shipment volume in PMI Duty Free;

•South & Southeast Asia, reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume, primarily in Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines, partly offset by Thailand;

•East Asia & Australia, primarily reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume in Japan and lower cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume in Korea, partly offset by higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume in Japan; and[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

partly offset by

Impact of Inventory Movements 

On a like-for-like basis, excluding the net favorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements of approximately 1.1 billion units, PMI’s total in-market sales declined by 1.5%, due to a 3.7% decline of cigarettes, partly offset by a 35.3% increase in heated tobacco units.

The net favorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements of approximately 1.1 billion units reflected a 2.7 billion favorable impact from heated tobacco units (driven primarily by Japan, mainly reflecting a favorable comparison with 2018 in which IQOS consumable inventories were reduced, partly offset by PMI Duty Free), partially offset by a 1.6 billion unfavorable impact from cigarettes (due primarily to Japan, North Africa and Thailand, partly offset by the EU Region and Saudi Arabia).

Fourth-Quarter

PMI's total shipment volume decreased by 5.0%, or by 4.4% on a like-for-like basis, principally due to:

•the EU, reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume, primarily in France, Germany and Italy, partly offset by higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume across the Region, notably in Italy;

•Middle East & Africa, reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume, notably in Turkey, partly offset by Saudi Arabia;

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SUMMARY

Full-Year 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net revenues, excluding unfavorable currency, increased by 3.8%, mainly reflecting: a favorable pricing variance, notably in Germany, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines and Turkey; and favorable volume/mix, mainly driven by heated tobacco unit and IQOS device volume in the EU and Russia, and heated tobacco unit volume in Japan, partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix of cigarettes, notably in Australia, the EU, Indonesia, Japan and Russia, unfavorable heated tobacco unit volume in PMI Duty Free, and unfavorable IQOS device volume in Japan and Korea. The currency-neutral growth in net revenues of 3.8% came despite the unfavorable impact of $763 million, shown in "Cost/Other," predominantly resulting from the deconsolidation of RBH. On a like-for-like basis, net revenues, excluding unfavorable currency, increased by 6.4%, as detailed in Schedule 9.

Operating income, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased by 4.9%. Excluding the loss on deconsolidation of RBH, the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense, asset impairment and exit charges related to plant closures in Argentina, Colombia, Germany and Pakistan as part of global manufacturing infrastructure optimization, as well as the Russia excise and VAT audit charge, adjusted operating income, excluding unfavorable currency, increased by 5.9%, primarily reflecting: a favorable pricing variance; favorable volume/mix, mainly driven by heated tobacco units in the EU, Japan and Russia, partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix of cigarettes, notably in Australia, the EU, Indonesia, Japan and Russia, as well as unfavorable heated tobacco unit volume in PMI Duty Free; and lower

The unfavorable volume/mix was partly offset by a favorable pricing variance, as well as lower manufacturing costs and lower marketing, administration and research costs, principally in Japan.

Adjusted operating income margin, excluding currency, increased by 1.5 points to 32.1%, as detailed in Schedule 8.

Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future 

Philip Morris International (PMI) is leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders. PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, as well as smoke-free products and associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the United States. In addition, PMI ships a version of its IQOS Platform 1 device and its consumables authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to Altria Group, Inc. for sale in the United States under license. PMI is building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. PMI's smoke-free IQOS product portfolio includes heat-not-burn and nicotine-containing vapor products. As of December 31, 2019, PMI estimates that approximately 9.7 million adult smokers around the world have already stopped smoking and switched to PMI's heat-not-burn product, available for sale in 52 markets in key cities or nationwide under the IQOS brand.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements

This press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI.

PMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco use; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; changes in adult smoker behavior; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials; and the integrity of its information systems and effectiveness of its data privacy policies. PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and commercialize reduced-risk products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; or if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent. Future results are also subject to the lower predictability of our reduced-risk product category's performance.

PMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a

Key Terms, Definitions and Explanatory Notes

General 

•"PMI" refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries. Trademarks and service marks that are the registered property of, or licensed by, the subsidiaries of PMI, are italicized.

•Comparisons are made to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated.

•Unless otherwise stated, references to total industry, total market, PMI shipment volume and PMI market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units.

•References to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the U.S., total industry, total market and market shares are PMI estimates for tax-paid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may, in defined instances, exclude the People's Republic of China and/or PMI's duty free business. In addition, to reflect the deconsolidation of PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. (RBH), effective March 22, 2019, PMI's total market share has been restated for previous periods.

•"OTP" is defined as "other tobacco products," primarily roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos, and does not include reduced-risk products.

•"Combustible products" is the term PMI uses to refer to cigarettes and OTP, combined.

•In-market sales, or "IMS," is defined as sales to the retail channel, depending on the market and distribution model. 

•"Total shipment volume" is defined as the combined total of cigarette shipment volume and heated tobacco unit shipment volume.

•"North Africa" is defined as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia.

•"The GCC" (Gulf Cooperation Council) is defined as Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•From time to time, PMI’s shipment volumes are subject to the impact of distributor inventory movements, and estimated total industry/market volumes are subject to the impact of inventory movements in various trade channels that include estimated trade inventory movements of PMI’s competitors arising from market-specific factors that significantly distort reported volume disclosures. Such factors may include changes to the manufacturing supply chain, shipment methods, consumer demand, timing of excise tax increases or other influences that may affect the timing of sales to customers. In such instances, in addition to reviewing PMI shipment volumes and certain estimated total industry/market volumes on a reported basis, management reviews these measures on an adjusted basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements. Management also believes that disclosing PMI shipment volumes and estimated total industry/market volumes in such circumstances on a basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements, such as on an IMS basis, improves the comparability of performance and trends for these measures over different reporting periods.

Financial

•Net revenues related to combustible products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. PMI recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer, typically either upon shipment or delivery of goods.

•Net revenues related to RRPs represent the sale of heated tobacco units, IQOS devices and related accessories, and other nicotine-containing products, primarily e-vapor products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. PMI recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer, typically either upon shipment or delivery of goods. 

•"Cost of sales" consists principally of: tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs; shipping and handling costs; and the cost of IQOS devices produced by third-party electronics manufacturing service providers. Estimated costs associated with IQOS warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.

- -28 -

•"Marketing, administration and research costs" include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. The most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses. 

•"Cost/Other" in the Consolidated Financial Summary table of total PMI and the six operating segments of this release reflects the currency-neutral variances of: cost of sales (excluding the volume/mix cost component); marketing, administration and research costs (including asset impairment and exit costs, the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense and the charge related to the deconsolidation of RBH in Canada, and the Russia excise & VAT audit charge); and amortization of intangibles. “Cost/Other” also includes the currency-neutral net revenue variance, unrelated to volume/mix and price components, attributable to fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets in the ME&A Region, as well as the impact of the deconsolidation in RBH.

•"Adjusted Operating Income Margin" is calculated as adjusted operating income, divided by net revenues.

•"Adjusted EBITDA" is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and equity (income)/loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries, excluding asset impairment and exit costs, and unusual items.

•"Net debt" is defined as total debt, less cash and cash equivalents.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Management reviews these measures because they exclude changes in currency exchange rates and other factors that may distort underlying business trends, thereby improving the comparability of PMI’s business performance between reporting periods. Furthermore, PMI uses several of these measures in its management compensation program to promote internal fairness and a disciplined assessment of performance against company targets. PMI discloses these measures to enable investors to view the business through the eyes of management. 

•Non-GAAP measures used in this release should neither be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, see the relevant schedules provided with this press release.

•U.S. GAAP Treatment of Argentina as a Highly Inflationary Economy. Following the categorization of Argentina by the International Practices Task Force of the Center for Audit Quality as a country with a three-year cumulative inflation rate greater than 100%, the country is considered highly inflationary in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Consequently, PMI began to account for the operations of its Argentinian affiliates as highly inflationary, and to treat the U.S. dollar as the functional currency of the affiliates, effective July 1, 2018.

•"Fair value adjustment for equity security investments" reflects the adjustment resulting from share price movements in passive investments for publicly traded entities that are not controlled or influenced by PMI. Under U.S. GAAP, such adjustments are required, since January 1, 2018, to be reflected directly in the income statement.

Reduced-Risk Products

•Reduced Risk Products (“RRPs”) is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing smoking. PMI has a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. PMI's RRPs are smoke-free products that produce an aerosol that contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to PMI's heat-not-burn products.

•The IQOS heat-not-burn device is a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

IQOS in the United States

•On April 30, 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the marketing of a version of IQOS, PMI's heat-not-burn product, together with its heated tobacco units (the term PMI uses to refer to heated tobacco consumables), is appropriate for the protection of public health and authorized it for sale in the U.S. The FDA’s decision follows its comprehensive assessment of PMI’s premarket tobacco product applications (PMTAs) submitted to the Agency in 2017. In the third quarter of 2019, PMI brought a version of its IQOS Platform 1 device and three variants of its heated tobacco units to the U.S. through its license with Altria Group, Inc., whose subsidiary, Philip Morris USA Inc., is responsible for marketing the product and complying with the provisions set forth in the FDA's marketing order.

•Shipment volume of heated tobacco units to the U.S. is included in the heated tobacco unit shipment volume of the Latin America & Canada segment. Revenues from shipments of Platform 1 devices, heated tobacco units and accessories to Altria Group, Inc. for sale under license in the U.S. are included in Net Revenues of the Latin America & Canada segment.
