Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

Accelerated Share Repurchase Program

On February 13, 2020, eBay entered into a master confirmation (each a “Master ASR Confirmation”) and a supplemental confirmation (together with the related Master ASR Confirmation, an “ASR Agreement”), with each of Citibank, N.A., HSBC Bank USA, National Association, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (each, an “ASR Counterparty”), as part of eBay’s share repurchase program. Under the ASR Agreements, eBay will pay an aggregate amount of $3 billion to the ASR Counterparties for an initial number of shares of the eBay’s common stock (the “Common Stock”) at the beginning of the transaction. The ultimate number of shares of Common Stock that eBay will repurchase under each ASR Agreement will be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the Common Stock during the term of such ASR Agreement, less a discount. At final settlement, each ASR Counterparty may be required to deliver additional shares of Common Stock to eBay or, under certain circumstances, eBay may be required to make a cash payment or deliver shares of Common Stock to the applicable ASR Counterparty. Each ASR Agreement contains the principal terms and provisions governing the accelerated share repurchase, including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the number of shares of Common Stock that will be delivered, the required timing of delivery of the shares, the circumstances under which adjustments may be made to the transactions, the circumstances under which the transactions may be terminated prior to their scheduled maturities and various acknowledgments, representations and warranties made by eBay and the applicable ASR Counterparty to one another.
