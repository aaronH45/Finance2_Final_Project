Item 2.02: Results of Operations and Financial Condition

The second paragraph of Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.02. 

Item 7.01: Regulation FD Disclosure

Cardinal Health, Inc. (the “Company”) today issued a news release announcing that it is initiating voluntary field actions for select surgical procedure packs, which have been on voluntary hold since January 13, 2020. A copy of the news release is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. 

In connection with the matters described in the release and the January 21, 2020 voluntary recall of certain surgical gowns, the Company expects to record a $96 million pre-tax charge in the three-months ended December 31, 2019. This charge represents our current best estimate of costs for the recalls and field action, including inventory write-offs and other remediation costs, such as costs to replace recalled products. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from this accrual. This charge, and any future increases or adjustments, will be excluded from our non-GAAP financial results. 

In addition to the current estimated costs for the three months ended December 31, 2019, we expect that these recalls will have other negative impacts, which could include: government investigations and enforcement actions by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or other regulators or U.S. or international governmental bodies (possibly resulting in product seizures, additional recalls, the issuance of safety alerts, the suspension or revocation of the authority to produce, distribute and sell products, and other civil or criminal sanctions; losses due to customer and patient claims, including product liability claims and lawsuits; reputational harm; and loss of customers and sales.
