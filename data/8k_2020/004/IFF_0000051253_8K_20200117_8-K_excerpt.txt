Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements  

This communication contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “would,” “target,” similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words.  

Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about the proposed Transactions, the expected timetable for completing the proposed Transactions, the benefits and synergies of the proposed Transactions, future opportunities for the combined company and products and any other statements regarding DuPont’s, IFF’s and N&Bco’s future operations, financial or operating results, capital allocation, dividend policy, debt ratio, anticipated business levels, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth, market opportunities, strategies, competitions, and other expectations and targets for future periods. There are several factors which could cause actual plans and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, (1) the parties’ ability to meet expectations regarding the timing, completion and accounting and tax treatments of the proposed Transactions, (2) changes in relevant tax and other laws, (3) any failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, approval of IFF’s shareholders, anticipated tax treatment or any required financing or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the proposed Transactions, (4) the possibility that unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies that could impact the value, timing or pursuit of the proposed Transactions, (5) risks and costs and pursuit and/or implementation of the separation of N&Bco, including timing anticipated to complete the separation, any changes to the configuration of businesses included in the separation if implemented, (6) potential inability or reduced access to the capital markets or increased cost of borrowings, including as a result of a credit rating downgrade, (7) inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates and judgments used in the preparation of financial statements and the providing of estimates of financial measures, in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and related standards, or on an adjusted basis, (8) the integration of IFF and its Frutarom business and/or N&Bco being more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected, (9) the failure to achieve expected or targeted future financial and operating performance and results, (10) the possibility that IFF may be unable to achieve expected benefits, synergies and operating efficiencies in connection with the proposed Transactions within the expected time frames or at all or to successfully integrate Frutarom and N&Bco, (11) customer loss and business disruption being greater than expected following the proposed Transactions, (12) the impact of divestitures required as a condition to consummation of the proposed Transactions as well as other conditional commitments, (13) legislative, regulatory and economic developments; (14) an increase or decrease in the anticipated transaction taxes (including due to any changes to tax legislation and its impact on tax rates (and the timing of the effectiveness of any such changes)), (15) potential litigation relating to the proposed Transactions that could be instituted against DuPont, IFF or their respective directors, (16) risks associated with third party contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the proposed Transactions, (17) negative effects of the announcement or the consummation of the Transactions on the market price of IFF’s common stock, (18) risks relating to the value of the IFF shares to be issued in the Transactions and uncertainty as to the long-term value of IFF’s common stock, (19) risks relating to IFF’s ongoing investigations into improper payments made in Frutarom businesses principally operating in Russia and the Ukraine, including expenses incurred with respect to the investigations, the cost of any remedial measures or compliance programs arising out of the investigations, legal proceedings or government investigations that may arise relating to the subject of IFF’s investigations, and the outcome of any such legal or government investigations, such as the imposition of fines, penalties, orders, or injunctions, (20) the impact of the failure to comply with U.S. or foreign anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, including with respect to IFF’s ongoing investigations into improper payments made in Frutarom businesses principally operating in Russia and the Ukraine, (21) the impact of the outcome of legal claims, regulatory investigations and litigation, including any that may arise out of IFF’s ongoing investigations into improper payments made in Frutarom businesses principally operating in Russia and the Ukraine, (22) the ability of N&Bco or IFF to retain and hire key personnel, (23) the risk that N&Bco, as a newly formed entity that currently has no credit rating, will not have access to the capital markets on acceptable terms, (24) the risk that N&Bco and IFF will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the potential Transactions, and the degree to which IFF will be leveraged following completion of the potential Transactions may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations, (25) the ability to obtain or consummate financing or refinancing related to the Transactions upon acceptable terms or at all, and (26) other risks to N&Bco’s and IFF’s business, operations and results of operations including from: failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; ability, cost and impact on business operations, including the supply chain, of responding to changes in market acceptance, rules, regulations and policies and failure to respond to such changes; outcome of significant litigation, environmental matters and other commitments and contingencies; failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues; global economic and capital market conditions, including the continued availability of capital and financing, as well as inflation, interest and currency exchange rates; changes in political conditions, including tariffs, trade disputes and retaliatory actions; impairment of goodwill or intangible assets; the availability of and fluctuations in the cost of energy and raw materials; business or

Further lists and descriptions of risks and uncertainties can be found in IFF’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2019 and IFF’s subsequent reports on Form 10-Q,  Form 10-K and Form 8-K. IFF disclaims any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.
