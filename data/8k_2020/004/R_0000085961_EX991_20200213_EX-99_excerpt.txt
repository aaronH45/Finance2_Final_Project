MIAMI, February 13, 2020 – Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE: R), a leader in commercial fleet management, supply chain and dedicated transportation solutions, reported record total and operating revenue for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. Total and operating revenue increased in all three segments reflecting new business and higher volumes for the full year. GAAP and comparable EPS for both the fourth quarter and full year were impacted by higher depreciation expense resulting from the previously announced change in residual value estimates. 

Results for the three months ended December 31 were as follows:

Total and operating revenue for the three months ended December 31 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Commenting on the company’s results, Ryder Chairman and CEO Robert Sanchez said, "In the fourth quarter, we delivered record total and operating revenue, driven by continued favorable outsourcing trends. Our earnings reflect the impact of the previously announced vehicle residual value estimate change. Comparable EPS in the fourth quarter was at the lower end of our forecast range, reflecting a modest increase in the depreciation impact of the vehicle residual value estimate change. As anticipated, the impact in the fourth quarter was less than in the prior quarter and is expected to continue to lessen which will benefit sequential earnings comparisons in future periods.

"In our supply chain and dedicated businesses, we saw pre-tax earnings improvement driven by strong operating performance, with SCS earnings overcoming the impact of customer labor strikes, previously announced lost business, and the impact of the previously announced vehicle residual value estimate change. 

"In our fleet management business, rental demand softened and came in slightly below our expectations. We made significant progress in rightsizing the rental fleet and redeploying equipment for a slower demand environment. Used vehicle sales results were in line with our expectations. Used vehicle sales volumes were up both year over year and sequentially, while used vehicle pricing was down and inventory levels were above our long-term target. 

"Looking back to the full year of 2019, we delivered comparable EBITDA growth of 11%. We continued to track ahead of expectations to achieve our multi-year maintenance cost-savings target. Additionally, we continued to realize significant benefits from our zero-based budgeting initiative.

"In connection with our initiatives to drive higher returns, we further increased ChoiceLease pricing and closed some underperforming FMS locations in the U.S. and Canada. We expanded the used vehicle retail sales capacity by increasing locations and are enhancing our online sales capability. 

"We continued to benefit from long-term outsourcing trends, with approximately 36% of growth coming from customers new to lease, and the impact of our sales and marketing initiatives.

"We continue to lead the market with new technologies in transportation and logistics. We expanded our commercial truck sharing platform COOP by RyderTM from Georgia and Florida into the Texas market and announced a new strategic partnership with In-Charge Energy, Inc. for electric vehicle charging infrastructure as we continue to invest in areas that can provide long-term revenue and earnings growth opportunities."

Fourth Quarter Business Segment Operating Results

Fleet Management Solutions

In the Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment, total revenue was $1.4 billion, up 4% from the year-earlier period. FMS operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel) was $1.2 billion, up 6% from the year-earlier period. Ryder ChoiceLeaseTM (lease) revenue increased 9%, reflecting a larger average fleet size as well as higher prices on new vehicles. The lease fleet grew by 10,500 vehicles or 7% for the full year. Commercial rental revenue decreased 4% from the year-earlier period due to lower demand for heavy-duty tractors.

FMS loss before tax was $80 million compared with earnings before tax of $111 million in 2018, reflecting $118 million of higher depreciation expense resulting from the vehicle residual value estimate change effective July 1, 2019, as well as lower rental earnings, higher insurance-related costs, and increased expense related to a higher number of vehicles being prepared for sale. Earnings in lease benefited from fleet growth and higher pricing. Commercial rental performance was negatively impacted primarily by lower demand for heavy-duty tractors, partially offset by higher demand for trucks and increased pricing on all vehicle types. Rental power fleet utilization was 76% in the fourth quarter, down from 82% in the year-earlier period, primarily driven by lower heavy-duty tractor utilization. The ending commercial rental fleet declined by 6% sequentially as compared to the third quarter, driven by the company's initiative to rightsize the fleet to align with current demand conditions. FMS loss before tax as a percentage of FMS total revenue and FMS operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure) were (5.6)% and (6.5)%, respectively. 

Supply Chain Solutions

In the Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment, total revenue was down 3% to $649 million and operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) was down 5% to $466 million compared with the year-earlier period. The decline in SCS total revenue and operating revenue primarily reflects previously announced lost business and customer labor strikes, partially offset by higher pricing.

SCS earnings before tax of $32 million increased 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $31 million in 2018. This increase was driven by improved operating performance and partially offset by impacts from customer labor strikes and a $3 million impact from the change in residual value estimates for vehicles used in this segment (which is eliminated in consolidation). SCS earnings before tax as a 

3

percentage of SCS total revenue and SCS operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure) were 5.0% and 6.9%, respectively, up 30 and 50 basis points from the prior year.

Dedicated Transportation Solutions

In the Dedicated Transportation Solutions (DTS) business segment, total revenue was down 5% to $346 million and operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure excluding fuel and subcontracted transportation) was up 4% to $241 million compared with the year-earlier period. The decline in DTS total revenue reflects lower subcontracted transportation revenue and lower fuel costs passed through to customers. DTS operating revenue growth reflects higher pricing and new business.

DTS earnings before tax of $18 million increased 14.6% compared with $16 million in 2018 due to improved operating performance and favorable developments from prior-period insurance claims, partially offset by $6 million from the change in residual value estimates on vehicles used in this segment (which is eliminated in consolidation). DTS earnings before tax as a percentage of DTS total revenue and DTS operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure) were 5.2% and 7.5%, respectively, up 80 and 70 basis points from the year-earlier period.

Corporate Financial Information

Central Support Services

In the fourth quarter of 2019, unallocated CSS costs were $15 million, unchanged from the year-earlier period.

Income Taxes

Tax rates in the fourth quarter were impacted by higher depreciation expense related to the previously announced vehicle residual value estimate change. Our effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2019 was a benefit of 56.6% as compared to an expense of 3.6% in the prior year. The comparable effective income tax rate (a non-GAAP measure) from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2019 was a benefit of 98.7% as compared to an expense of 21.0% in the prior year.

Capital Expenditures

Full-year capital expenditures increased to $3.6 billion in 2019 compared with $3.2 billion in 2018. The increase in capital expenditures reflects higher planned investments to grow and refresh the lease fleet to fulfill customer contracts. Proceeds of $518 million were up $122 million from the prior year and include $43 million from the sale of property in the second quarter of 2019. Net capital expenditures (including proceeds from the sale of assets) were $3.1 billion in 2019 up from $2.8 billion in 2018. 

Cash Flow and Leverage

Full-year operating cash flow was $2.1 billion in 2019, up from $1.7 billion in 2018. Total cash generated (a non-GAAP measure that includes proceeds from used vehicle sales) was $2.7 billion compared with $2.1 billion in 2018. Free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) was negative $1.1 billion, compared with negative $936 million in 2018, reflecting increased net capital spending.

Total debt as of December 31, 2019 was $7.9 billion, up from $6.6 billion in 2018. Debt-to-equity as of December 31, 2019 was 320% compared with 262% at year-end 2018, above the company's long-term target of 250-300%. The increase in debt-to-equity reflects the impacts from capital spending on vehicles 

4

and a reduction in equity related to higher non-cash depreciation expense from the previously announced vehicle residual value estimate change. Ryder plans to reduce leverage over time as the company moves past the near-term impact of the residual value estimate change.

2020 Earnings Forecast

Commenting on the company’s outlook, Mr. Sanchez said, "Going forward, we anticipate executing a strategy of moderate growth in FMS and accelerating growth in dedicated and supply chain, delivering a balance of revenue and earnings growth with positive free cash flow over a cycle. 

"The demand for our core services remains strong, and we continue to benefit from favorable outsourcing trends in large, attractive markets. As a reminder, we continue to expect leases signed since 2014 to provide returns at or above target levels, including the record number of leases signed in the last two years. Additionally and in light of the increased volatility in the used truck market, we are taking actions that we expect will further improve returns in the coming years. These initiatives include additional up-pricing of leases, pruning lower-return accounts upon renewal, expanding used vehicle retail sales capacity, and accelerating cost-savings initiatives. As an industry leader, we are confident in our ability to execute on our initiatives. 

"In 2020, we expect year-over-year operating revenue to be unchanged. While we anticipate growth in lease and supply chain, we expect this growth to be offset by a slowdown in rental and dedicated transportation solutions.

"In ChoiceLease, we forecast revenue to grow but at a slower pace than last year, partially due to an anticipated decline in new vehicle production by OEMs and from our initiatives to improve returns, including additional price increases on new and renewing leases. We expect our active lease fleet count to be higher by up to 1,000 vehicles. 

"We anticipate softer conditions in rental throughout the year reflecting a weaker freight environment, particularly for heavy duty tractors. We expect the rental fleet to be substantially rightsized by the end of first quarter in line with the anticipated demand environment. As a result year-over-year utilization comparisons are forecast to improve in the second half. We expect modestly higher rental pricing in 2020. 

"In used vehicle sales, we anticipate a higher number of vehicles to be sold during the year. Used vehicle pricing is forecast to remain soft during the first half of 2020, with a modest recovery in the second half of the year. 

"In supply chain, while first half 2020 revenue growth will continue to be impacted by two previously announced customer losses, we anticipate the revenue growth rate in the second half of the year to be near our long-term target. We expect supply chain earnings to benefit from higher pricing and new business, offset by strategic investments, prior-year favorable insurance developments, and residual value estimate changes on vehicles used in this segment. 

"In dedicated, we anticipate that 2020 revenue growth will be impacted by lower than expected sales in the second half of 2019, following two years of record sales. We expect earnings headwinds from prior-year favorable insurance developments, residual value estimate changes on vehicles used in this segment, and strategic investments. We have taken additional steps to expand the sales force and implement targeted marketing initiatives in this segment. We remain confident in our expectation that we will achieve our multi-year target growth rates, although sales in this segment can be uneven due to the impact of large deals.

5

"As for our earnings outlook, we expect an increase in EPS reflecting a lessened impact from the previously announced vehicle residual value estimate change and growth in our contractual business. These benefits are expected to be partially offset by lower rental demand, strategic investments, and costs related to our actions to improve future returns. Benefits related to our zero-based budgeting cost savings program are anticipated to offset higher employee compensation and benefit costs.

"We expect a near-term negative earnings impact related to some of our return-on-capital action plans which are expected to improve performance in future years. These include impacts from the termination of our lease insurance program in order to reduce future risk, the closure of underperforming facilities, and the non-renewal of lower-return accounts. 

"To drive future earnings growth, we plan to continue to invest in strategic initiatives in sales and marketing including additional resources in dedicated and supply chain, information technology, and new product development related to disruptive trends in the industry. These investments in recent years have allowed us to grow revenue and launch exciting new products like COOP by RyderTM and our e-commerce fulfillment solution. We're encouraged by the progress we're making with RyderShareTM, which is aimed at digitizing the supply chain and creating real-time visibility and collaboration for our customers.

"We anticipate a significant reduction in capital spending as a result of slower market conditions in rental and lower lease growth. Free cash flow is forecast to turn positive and significantly increase to $350 million. We anticipate our balance sheet leverage to decline modestly at year-end.

"First quarter earnings in 2020 reflect the impact of the previously announced vehicle residual value estimate change and are typically the lowest quarter seasonally in the year. Additionally, first quarter earnings comparisons are challenging versus very strong results in the first quarter of 2019."

Forecast and results for full year and first quarter are as follows:

APPENDIX - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE RECONCILIATIONS - UNAUDITED

Set forth in the table below is an overview of each non-GAAP financial measure and why management believes that presentation of each non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. See reconciliations for each of these measures following this table.

 Operating Revenue Measures:

 Operating Revenue

FMS Operating Revenue

SCS Operating Revenue

DTS Operating Revenue

FMS EBT as a % of FMS Operating Revenue

SCS EBT as a % of SCS Operating Revenue

DTS EBT as a % of DTS Operating Revenue

Operating revenue is defined as total revenue for Ryder System, Inc. or each business segment (FMS, SCS and DTS) excluding any (1) fuel and (2) subcontracted transportation. We believe operating revenue provides useful information to investors as we use it to evaluate the operating performance of our core businesses and as a measure of sales activity at the consolidated level for Ryder System, Inc., as well as for each of our business segments. We also use segment EBT as a percentage of segment operating revenue for each business segment for the same reason. Note: FMS EBT, SCS EBT and DTS EBT, our primary measures of segment performance, are not non-GAAP measures.

Fuel: We exclude FMS, SCS and DTS fuel from the calculation of our operating revenue measures, as fuel is an ancillary service that we provide our customers, which is impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices and the costs are largely a pass-through to our customers, resulting in minimal changes in our profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by rapid changes in market fuel prices during a short period of time, as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on trailing market fuel costs.

Subcontracted transportation: We also exclude subcontracted transportation from the calculation of our operating revenue measures, as these services are also typically a pass-through to our customers and, therefore, fluctuations result in minimal changes to our profitability. While our SCS and DTS business segments subcontract certain transportation services to third party providers, our FMS business segment does not engage in subcontracted transportation and, therefore, this item is not applicable to FMS.

 Comparable Earnings Measures:

Comparable Earnings before Income Taxes (EBT) and Comparable Tax Rate

Comparable Earnings

Comparable earnings per diluted common share (EPS)

Adjusted Return on Equity (ROE)

Adjusted Return on Capital (ROC)

Comparable EBT, comparable earnings and comparable EPS are defined, respectively, as GAAP EBT, earnings and EPS, all from continuing operations, excluding (1) non-operating pension costs and (2) any other significant items that are not representative of our business operations. We believe these comparable earnings measures provide useful information to investors and allow for better year-over-year comparison of operating performance.

Non-operating pension costs: Our comparable earnings measures exclude non-operating pension costs, which include the amortization of net actuarial loss and prior service cost, interest cost and expected return on plan assets components of pension and postretirement benefit costs, as well as a settlement or curtailment of a plan. We exclude non-operating pension costs because we consider these to be impacted by financial market performance and outside the operational performance of our business.

Other Items Impacting Comparability: Our comparable and adjusted earnings measures also exclude other significant items that are not representative of our business operations as detailed in the reconciliation table below. These other significant items vary from period to period and, in some periods, there may be no such significant items. 

Calculation of comparable tax rate: The comparable provision for income taxes is computed using the same methodology as the GAAP provision for income taxes. Income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated based on the statutory tax rates of the jurisdictions to which the non-GAAP adjustments relate.

Adjusted ROE: Adjusted ROE is defined as adjusted net earnings divided by adjusted average shareholders' equity and represents the rate of return on shareholders' investment. Other items impacting comparability described above are excluded, as applicable, from the calculation of net earnings and average shareholders' equity. We use adjusted ROE as an internal measure of how effectively we use the owned capital invested in our operations.

Adjusted ROC: Adjusted ROC is defined as adjusted net earnings divided by average total capital and represents the rate of return generated by the capital deployed in our business. Other items impacting comparability described above are excluded, as applicable, from the calculation of net earnings and average shareholders' equity (a component of average total capital).We use adjusted ROC as an internal measure of how effectively we use the capital invested (borrowed or owned) in our operations.

Comparable EBITDA is defined as earnings from continuing operations, net of tax, first adjusted to exclude the following items, all from continuing operations: (1) non-operating pension costs and (2) any other items that are not representative of our business operations (these items are the same items that are excluded from comparable earnings measures for the relevant periods and are described under Comparable Earnings Measures above) and then adjusted further for (1) interest expense, (2) income taxes, (3) depreciation, (4) losses from used vehicle fair value adjustments and (5) amortization.

We believe comparable EBITDA provides investors with useful information, as it is a standard measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to measure financial performance and our ability to service debt and meet our payment obligations. In addition, we believe that the inclusion of comparable EBITDA provides consistency in financial reporting and enables analysts and investors to perform meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results. Other companies may calculate comparable EBITDA differently; therefore, our presentation of comparable EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.

Comparable EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes or earnings from continuing operations determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.

Cash Flow Measures:

Total Cash Generated

Free Cash FlowWe consider total cash generated and free cash flow to be important measures of comparative operating performance, as our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment.

Total Cash Generated: Total cash generated is defined as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities, (2) net cash provided by the sale of revenue earning equipment, (3) net cash provided by the sale of operating property and equipment, and (4) other cash inflows from investing activities. We believe total cash generated is an important measure of total cash flows generated from our ongoing business activities. 

Free Cash Flow: We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating activities and investing activities (excluding acquisitions) from continuing operations as “free cash flow”. We calculate free cash flow as the sum of (1) net cash provided by operating activities, (2) net cash provided by the sale of revenue earning equipment, (3) net cash provided by the sale of operating property and equipment, and (4) other cash inflows from investing activities, less (5) purchases of property and revenue earning equipment. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and for shareholders, after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
