EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY 

“In 2019, Zoetis delivered another year of strong growth and market leadership thanks to our diverse and durable portfolio and commitment to continuous innovation,” said Kristin Peck, Chief Executive Officer of Zoetis. “We grew revenue 10% operationally, which is once again above market growth in a competitive, global sector. We also grew our adjusted net income faster than revenue, at 14% operationally, continuing to achieve our goal of growing profitability faster than revenue over the long term.”

“Looking ahead in 2020, we are excited about the launch of Simparica® Trio, our new triple combination parasiticide for dogs, and we will be heavily focused on bringing this key innovation to customers around the world,” said Peck. “Additionally, we will continue to advance our pipeline with innovations in parasiticides, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines; support our latest product launches and lifecycle innovations across the portfolio; and invest in newer growth areas for us such as diagnostics, digital and data analytics. For full year 2020, we expect operational growth of 7% to 9.5% in revenue and 8% to 11% in adjusted net income. As the new CEO of Zoetis, I look forward to carrying on the company’s successful formula of customer focus, innovation and execution, as we continue to deliver on our long-term value proposition to shareholders.”

INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH

Zoetis diversifies and grows its business through the introduction of new products, lifecycle innovations, business development initiatives, and entries into new markets and technologies. The company is increasingly focused on developing integrated solutions for pet owners, veterinarians and farmers that span the continuum of animal care - helping to predict, prevent, detect and treat diseases.

Since our last quarterly earnings announcement, Zoetis has continued to expand its reference laboratory capabilities in the U.S. with the acquisitions of Phoenix Lab and ZNLabs in November 2019 and Ethos Diagnostic Science this month. This builds on the company’s strategy to develop a more comprehensive diagnostics offering with enhanced value for veterinarians.

Zoetis also received approval for Rimadyl® (carprofen) for dogs in China, one of the fastest growing companion animal markets in the world. This product, approved in both chewable and injectable formulations, is indicated for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis (chewables), and for the control of postoperative pain associated with soft tissue and orthopedic surgeries (injectable). It was first approved in the UK in 1993, and is an example of the product durability and longevity generated by the company’s focus on lifecycle innovation and geographic expansion.

DISCLOSURE NOTICES

Forward-Looking Statements: This press release contains forward-looking statements, which reflect the current views of Zoetis with respect to business plans or prospects, future operating or financial performance, future guidance, future operating models, expectations regarding products, product approvals or products under development, expected timing of product launches, expectations regarding the performance of acquired companies and our ability to integrate new businesses, expectations regarding the financial impact of acquisitions, future use of cash and dividend payments, tax rate and tax regimes, changes in the tax regimes and laws in other jurisdictions, and other future events. These statements are not guarantees of future performance or actions. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if management's underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. Zoetis expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A further list and description of risks, uncertainties and other matters can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, including in the sections thereof captioned “Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Future Results” and “Item 1A.

These filings and subsequent filings are available online at www.sec.gov, www.zoetis.com, or on request from Zoetis.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and operational results (which exclude the impact of foreign exchange), to assess and analyze our results and trends and to make financial and operational decisions. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors because they provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release should not be considered alternatives to measurements required by GAAP, such as net income, operating income, and earnings per share, and should not be considered measures of liquidity. These non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this press release and are posted on our website at www.zoetis.com.

Internet Posting of Information: We routinely post information that may be important to investors in the 'Investors' section of our website at www.zoetis.com, on our Facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/zoetis and on Twitter@zoetis. We encourage investors and potential investors to consult our website regularly and to follow us on Facebook and Twitter for important information about us.

2020 GUIDANCE 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January 2020.

Reconciliations of 2020 reported guidance to 2020 adjusted guidance follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Operational growth (a non-GAAP financial measure) excludes the impact of foreign exchange.

(b)Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are defined as reported U.S. GAAP net income and its components and reported diluted EPS excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. Adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted R&D expenses, and adjusted interest expense and other (income)/deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and, therefore, components of the overall adjusted income measure. Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. Adjusted net income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS. 

(c)We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted net income operational growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP reported financial measure because we are unable to calculate with reasonable certainty the foreign exchange impact of unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, potential future asset impairments and other certain significant items, without unreasonable effort. The foreign exchange impacts of these items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the guidance period. 

(d)Primarily includes certain nonrecurring costs related to acquisitions and other charges.
