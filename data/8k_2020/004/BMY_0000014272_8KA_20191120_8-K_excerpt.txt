 Item 2.01.  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.      

On November 20, 2019, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“Bristol-Myers Squibb”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Current Report on Form 8-K (the “Initial Report”) to report the consummation of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s acquisition of Celgene Corporation (“Celgene”) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of January 2, 2019, by and among Bristol-Myers Squibb, Burgundy Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb (“Merger Sub”), and Celgene. Under the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Celgene with Celgene surviving as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb (the “Merger”). 

This Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends the Initial Report to include the following historical financial statements and pro forma financial information required by Item 9.01 of Form 8-K that were previously omitted from the Initial Report as permitted by Item 9.01(a)(4): (a) the audited consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule of Celgene as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2018, and the notes related thereto and the related reports of KPMG LLP, Celgene’s independent registered public accounting firm, which are included as Exhibit 99.1, (b) Celgene’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes for the nine-months ended September 30, 2019, which are included as Exhibit 99.2 and (c) the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of Bristol-Myers Squibb giving effect to the Merger (the “pro forma financial information”), which includes the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2019, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 and for the nine-months ended September 30, 2019, and the notes related thereto, which is included as Exhibit 99.3. 

In addition, this Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends the Initial Report to update the total number of Bristol-Myers Squibb Contingent Value Rights (“CVRs”) that may be issuable to former Celgene equity award holders as a consequence of the Merger. In respect of outstanding Celgene equity awards, Bristol-Myers Squibb has an obligation to deliver up to 55,906,849 CVRs to former Celgene equity award holders in exchange for their outstanding equity awards in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.  

The pro forma financial information included in this Current Report on Form 8-K has been presented for informational purposes only. It does not purport to represent the actual results of operations that Bristol-Myers Squibb and Celgene would have achieved had the companies been combined during the periods presented in the pro forma financial information and is not intended to project the future results of operations that the combined company may achieve after the consummation of the Merger. Except as described above, all other information in the Initial Report remains unchanged.
