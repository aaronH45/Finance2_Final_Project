Nucor Reports Results for Fourth Quarter of 2019 

CHARLOTTE, N.C. – January 28, 2020 - Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) today announced consolidated net earnings of $107.8 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2019. Included in the fourth quarter of 2019 earnings are non-cash impairment charges of $66.9 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. By comparison, Nucor reported consolidated net earnings of $275.0 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2019 and consolidated net earnings of $646.8 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2018.  

For the full year 2019, Nucor reported consolidated net earnings of $1.27 billion, or $4.14 per diluted share, compared to $2.36 billion, or $7.42 per diluted share, in 2018. 

“Stronger than expected steel mill segment performance in December was the primary driver for higher actual fourth quarter earnings than we indicated in our mid-December quantitative guidance,” said Leon Topalian, Nucor’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We believe that the inventory destocking that occurred throughout most of 2019 concluded in the fourth quarter, when customers resumed more normal buying patterns. Additionally, general business conditions improved in the fourth quarter due to a number of factors, including a rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the new labor agreement between the United Automobile Workers and GM, and definitive progress on the trade front.” 

“For the full year, strong performance in many of our steel products businesses partially offset the impact of destocking on our steelmaking operations. In particular, our Vulcraft/Verco and Building Systems groups both achieved record profitability in 2019, reflecting both strong execution by our teammates and favorable nonresidential construction market conditions.” 

Mr. Topalian added, “We are encouraged by recent economic trends and confident that our positive momentum will continue in 2020. I would like to thank Nucor’s dedicated teammates across the company for their continued focus on safety, serving our customers and creating value for shareholders.”

Financial Review 

As previously mentioned, included in the fourth quarter of 2019 results are non-cash impairment charges of $66.9 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. Of that amount, $35.0 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, relates to an impairment of our proved producing natural gas well assets that is included in the raw materials segment. Also included in that amount is a $20.0 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, impairment charge that relates to a long-lived asset in the steel mills segment, and an $11.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, charge that relates to the write-down of certain intangible assets in the steel products segment. These non-cash impairment charges were not known at the time of our quantitative guidance release on December 12, 2019.  

Nucor’s consolidated net sales decreased 6% to $5.13 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $5.46 billion in the third quarter of 2019 and decreased 18% compared with $6.30 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. Average sales price per ton in the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased 5% compared with the third quarter of 2019 and decreased 16% compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. A total of 6,486,000 tons were shipped to outside customers in the fourth quarter of 2019, a 1% decrease from the third quarter of 2019 and a 3% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2018. Total steel mill shipments in the fourth quarter of 2019 remained flat as compared to the third quarter of 2019 and decreased 2% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Steel mill shipments to internal customers represented 21% of total steel mill shipments in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with 21% in the third quarter of 2019 and 19% in the fourth quarter of 2018. Downstream steel product shipments to outside customers in the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased 2% from the third quarter of 2019 and increased 8% from the fourth quarter of 2018. 

For 2019, Nucor’s consolidated net sales decreased 10% to $22.59 billion, compared with $25.07 billion for 2018. Total tons shipped to outside customers in 2019 were 26,532,000, a decrease of 5% from 2018, while the average sales price per ton decreased 5% from 2018.

Nucor Reports Results for Fourth Quarter of 2019 (Continued) 

For 2019, pre-operating and start-up costs related to the Company’s growth projects were approximately $103 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared with approximately $36 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for 2018. 

Overall operating rates at the Company’s steel mills remained flat at 83% in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to the third quarter of 2019 and decreased compared to 88% in the fourth quarter of 2018. Operating rates for the full year 2019 decreased to 84% as compared to 91% for the full year 2018. 

Nucor’s liquidity position remains strong with $1.83 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2019 and an untapped $1.50 billion revolving credit facility that does not expire until April 2023.  

Fourth Quarter of 2019 Analysis 

As expected, the performance of the steel mills segment in the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased compared to the third quarter of 2019 as lower steel prices at the end of the third quarter impacted our fourth quarter results. During the fourth quarter, domestic scrap metal prices rose markedly and our sheet, plate, structural and bar mills all implemented price increases.  

The profitability of the steel products segment in the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased slightly as compared to the third quarter of 2019 due to normal year-end seasonality. However, the fourth quarter of 2019 was the best fourth quarter in that segment’s history and significantly higher than the fourth quarter of 2018. 

Losses in the raw materials segment significantly increased in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to the third quarter of 2019 due to the impact of our Louisiana DRI plant’s planned outage which was completed in mid-November, the previously discussed impairment charge related to one of our fields of proved producing natural gas well assets and further margin compression throughout our raw materials businesses. 

Business and Operational Enhancements 

On December 11, 2019, Nucor acquired TrueCore, LLC (TrueCore), an insulated metal panel manufacturing company with a facility in Laurens, South Carolina. TrueCore produces insulated metal panels that service the cold storage market, with future plans for additional commercial and industrial applications. 

On December 18, 2019, Nucor announced that its board of directors approved an expansion project which will add a coil paint line at the company’s sheet mill in Mississippi County, Arkansas. The new coil paint line will have a capacity of approximately 250,000 tons per year and is expected to start up in the first half of 2022, pending permit and regulatory approval.

Commitment to Returning Capital to Shareholders 

During the fourth quarter of 2019, Nucor repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $54.61 per share. Nucor repurchased approximately 5.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $56.33 per share during 2019. As of December 31, 2019, Nucor had approximately 301,812,000 shares outstanding and approximately $1.20 billion remaining for repurchases under its authorized share repurchase program. This share repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no scheduled expiration date.  

On December 13, 2019, Nucor’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.4025 per share. This cash dividend is payable on February 11, 2020 to stockholders of record as of December 31, 2019 and is Nucor’s 187th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. Nucor has increased its regular, or base, dividend for 47 consecutive years – every year since it first began paying dividends in 1973. Over the past ten years, Nucor has returned approximately $6 billion in capital to its stockholders in the form of base dividends and share repurchases.  

First Quarter of 2020 Outlook

We expect Nucor’s earnings in the first quarter of 2020 to increase as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect earnings in the steel mills segment to increase in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 (excluding the fourth quarter of 2019 impairment charge), due to the previously mentioned price increases and expected higher volumes. We expect a more stable pricing environment in 2020 after the severe inventory destocking that occurred in 2019. We expect the profitability of the steel products segment in the first quarter of 2020 to decrease as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 (excluding the fourth quarter of 2019 impairment charges) due to normal seasonality. We expect the performance of the raw materials segment to increase in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, due to an improvement in pricing for raw materials, the absence of the impairment charge related to our proved producing natural gas well assets and no planned nonroutine outages at our Louisiana DRI plant.
