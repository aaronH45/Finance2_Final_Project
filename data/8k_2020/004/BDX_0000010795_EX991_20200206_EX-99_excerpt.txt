•The company is lowering its full fiscal year 2020 revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect the impact of the remediation effort and anticipated loss of sales of the Alaris infusion system.

Franklin Lakes, NJ (February 6, 2020) - BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE: BDX), a leading global medical technology company, today reported quarterly revenues of $4.225 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019. This represents an increase of 1.6 percent as reported over the prior-year period, or 2.5 percent on a currency-neutral basis. 

BD also announced today that it is continuing to work with the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) on its software remediation plan for the Alaris System, which will require additional regulatory filings beyond what the company previously anticipated. The company expects to submit its comprehensive regulatory filing in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. In the interim, the company will partner with the FDA and existing customers to ensure continued access to the Alaris System under medical necessity. As a result, the company is lowering its full fiscal year revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance.

“In the first quarter, the BD team delivered solid results, in line with our expectations,” said Tom Polen, CEO and president. “As we look ahead to the balance of the fiscal year, we are focused on the resolution of the Alaris pump matter. We stand behind the safety of the Alaris System, which is used in the care of 70 percent of patients undergoing infusion therapy. Now, we need to take the necessary steps to meet the FDA's expectations with respect to the Alaris System. We are committed to doing what is right for customers, patients and shareholders. You can expect that our purpose and values will always be at the core of who we are and how we work to resolve this situation moving forward.” 

First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Operating Results

As reported, diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.87, compared with $2.05 in the prior-year period. This represents a decrease of 57.6 percent, and is primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Advanced Bioprocessing business in the prior-year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.65, compared with $2.70 in the prior-year period. This represents a decrease in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 1.9 percent, or 0.4 percent on a currency-neutral basis. 

Segment Results

In the BD Medical segment, as reported, worldwide revenues for the quarter of $2.090 billion decreased 2.1 percent from the prior-year period, or 1.1 percent on a currency-neutral basis. As anticipated, the segment's results reflect growth in the Pharmaceutical Systems unit that was offset by declines in the Medication Management Solutions and Diabetes Care units and revenues in the Medication Delivery Solutions unit that were about flat when compared to the prior year.

In the BD Life Sciences segment, as reported, worldwide revenues for the quarter of $1.123 billion increased 6.4 percent over the prior-year period, or 7.4 percent on a currency-neutral basis. Revenue growth was driven by performance in the Biosciences and Diagnostic Systems units. BD Life Sciences' growth was aided by flu-related revenues in the Diagnostic Systems unit as a result of a stronger flu season in comparison to the prior year.

In the BD Interventional segment, as reported, worldwide revenues for the quarter of $1.012 billion increased 4.4 percent over the prior-year period, or 5.0 percent on a currency-neutral basis. Revenue growth was driven by performance across the Surgery, Urology and Critical Care and Peripheral Intervention units.

Geographic Results

As reported, first quarter revenues in the U.S. of $2.430 billion increased 1.8 percent over the prior-year period. Growth in the U.S. was driven by performance in the Life Sciences and Interventional segments, partially offset by a decline in the Medical segment, as anticipated.

As reported, revenues outside of the U.S. of $1.795 billion increased 1.2 percent over the prior-year period, or 3.4 percent on a currency-neutral basis. International revenue growth was driven by performance in China and the Asia Pacific region.

Fiscal 2020 Outlook for Full Year

The company is lowering its full fiscal year 2020 revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect the impact of the remediation effort and anticipated loss of sales of the Alaris infusion system.

The company now expects full fiscal year 2020 revenues to increase 1.5 to 2.5 percent as reported, or 2.5 to 3.5 percent on a currency-neutral basis.

The company now expects full fiscal year 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $11.90 and $12.10. This represents growth of approximately 4.0 to 5.5 percent on a currency-neutral basis over fiscal 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $11.68, or growth of approximately 2.0 to 3.5 percent including the estimated unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance includes an adverse impact of approximately 500 basis points related to the expiration of the Gore royalty. 

Adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2020 excludes potential charges or gains that may be recorded during the fiscal year, such as, among other things, the non-cash amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related charges, and certain tax matters. BD does not attempt to provide reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP earnings guidance to the comparable GAAP measure because the impact and timing of these potential charges or gains is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and is unavailable without unreasonable efforts. In addition, the company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. Such items could have a substantial impact on GAAP measures of BD's financial performance.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures/Financial Tables

This news release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these and other non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the attached financial tables. Within the attached financial tables presented, certain 

columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts.

Current and prior-year adjusted diluted earnings per share results exclude, among other things, the impact of purchase accounting adjustments (including the non-cash amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets); integration, restructuring and transaction costs; transactional and product related impacts; and the loss on debt extinguishment. We also provide these measures on a currency-neutral basis after eliminating the effect of foreign currency translation, where applicable. We calculate foreign currency-neutral percentages by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior period foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. Reconciliations of these amounts to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the tables at the end of this release.
