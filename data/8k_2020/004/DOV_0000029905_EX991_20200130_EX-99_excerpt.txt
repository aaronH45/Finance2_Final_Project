MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY:

Dover’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Richard J. Tobin, said, “Dover delivered solid results in the fourth quarter. As expected, revenue declined slightly as we faced a difficult comparable from the fourth quarter of 2018. Segment EBIT margin continued to expand year-over-year, consistent with prior quarters as our margin improvement and operational efficiency programs continue to deliver tangible results. 

“During the fourth quarter, our Fueling Solutions segment grew despite a challenging comparable quarter in 2018, driven by strong global demand, most notably in North America on a pickup in EMV compliance activity. Solid growth in Engineered Products was driven by healthy activity in both the waste handling equipment and software business and aftermarket vehicle services.

“The Imaging & Identification segment declined slightly in the quarter, a result of continued slower marking & coding activity in Asia, as well as slower activity in the digital textile printing business. The Pumps & Process Solutions segment posted a revenue decline, primarily due to comparable calendarization in our plastics processing business as well as slower demand in our pumps and precision components businesses as a result of channel inventory drawdowns. The segment’s biopharma business continued its double-digit growth trajectory. Finally, Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment had a slower quarter due to continued softness in new food retail store builds negatively impacting our systems volumes, partially offset by continued strength in core food retail case products and return to growth in our beverage can making and heat exchangers businesses. 

“Overall, Dover delivered strong results for the full year 2019 despite an uncertain economic backdrop. Revenue growth was healthy across a majority of the portfolio and our businesses converted it well into earnings. Our strong operational execution delivered a significant increase in comparable cash flow and was complemented by value-creating and disciplined capital allocation, including large capital projects focused on growth and productivity, several attractive bolt-on acquisitions, and opportunistic share repurchases.

“As we enter 2020, most markets remain constructive. Order backlog is up year-over-year in four out of five segments, we are progressing well on multiple in-flight cost and productivity initiatives, and our M&A pipeline remains active. We are well-positioned to deliver top-line growth, margin expansion and solid EPS accretion in 2020, as outlined in our September investor meeting. Our strategy remains unchanged for 2020: drive value-creation through sustained growth, continued profitability improvement, strong cash flow and smart organic and inorganic capital deployment.”

FULL YEAR 2020 GUIDANCE:

In 2020, Dover expects to generate GAAP EPS in the range of $5.48 to $5.68 (adjusted EPS of $6.20 to $6.40), based on full year revenue growth of 2% to 3%. A full reconciliation between forecasted GAAP and forecasted adjusted measures is included as an exhibit herein.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS:

On January 24, 2020, Dover closed the previously-announced acquisition of Systech International, a leading provider of traceability and brand-protection software solutions to global pharmaceutical and FMCG manufacturers. The transaction is expected to deliver accretive first year adjusted EPS. 

On January 24, 2020, Dover signed an agreement to acquire Soft-Pak, Incorporated, a provider of software solutions for waste handling fleets. The transaction is expected to close in Q1 2020.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2019

(Amounts in thousands except share data and where otherwise indicated)

Change in Segments

Effective October 1, 2019, the Company transitioned from a three-segment to a five-segment structure as a result of a change to its internal organization. This new structure will increase management efficiency and better align the Company’s operations with its strategic initiatives and capital allocation priorities across its businesses. All periods are presented under the new structure.

Acquisitions

The Company did not complete any acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year 2019, the Company acquired three businesses in separate transactions for total consideration of $216.4 million, net of cash acquired and including contingent consideration. The businesses were acquired to complement and expand upon existing operations within the Fueling Solutions and Pumps & Process Solutions segments.

Discontinued and Disposed Businesses

The Company did not dispose of any businesses during the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year 2019, the Company completed the sale of Finder, which generated total cash proceeds of $24.2 million. The Finder business was included in the results of the Pumps & Process Solutions segment. The sale does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations and financial results and, therefore, did not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation. 

Rightsizing and Other Costs

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company executed several programs in order to further optimize operations. Rightsizing programs in 2019 included 1) broad-based selling, general and administrative expense reduction and 2) initiation of footprint consolidation actions. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded rightsizing and other related costs of $17.9 million which is comprised of $14.8 million of restructuring costs and $3.1 million of other charges. During the full year 2019, the Company recorded rightsizing and other related costs of $32.2 million which is comprised of $26.8 million of restructuring costs and $5.3 million of other charges. These costs primarily relate to actions taken on employee reductions, facility consolidations and site closures, product line exits and other associated asset charges. During the fourth quarter and full year 2019, rightsizing and other charges were broad based across all segments as well as corporate, with costs incurred by segment as follows:

 * Totals may be impacted by rounding.

Tax Rate

The effective tax rate was 14.7% and 15.4% for the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. On a full year basis, the effective tax rate for 2019 and 2018 was 19.6% and 18.5%, respectively. The 2019 tax rate was primarily driven by the tax deduction for share-based awards and other favorable discrete items, partially offset by the exclusion of capital losses on a disposition of a business under local tax law. The 2018 tax rate was impacted by the tax deduction for share-based awards, the impact of SAB 118 from US Tax Reform, and other favorable discrete items.

Borrowings

The proceeds from the sale of euro-denominated notes of €494.7 million, net of discounts and issuance costs, were used in part to redeem the €300 million 2.125% notes due 2020. The proceeds from the sale of notes of $296.9 million, net of discounts and issuance costs, and the remaining funds from the sale of the euro-denominated notes, were used to fund the redemption of the $450 million 4.30% notes due 2021. The remainder of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The early extinguishment of debt resulted in a pre-tax loss of $23.5 million.

Non-GAAP Disclosures

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, Management also discloses non-GAAP information that Management believes provides useful information to investors. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, total segment earnings (EBIT), adjusted EBIT by segment, adjusted EBIT margin by segment, adjusted EBITDA by segment, adjusted EBITDA margin by segment, net debt, net capitalization, net debt to net capitalization ratios, free cash flow, free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow as a percentage of earnings, and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for earnings from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, debt or equity, cash flows from operating activities, or revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

Adjusted earnings from continuing operations represents earnings from continuing operations adjusted for the effect of acquisition-related amortization, rightsizing and other costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on assets held for sale, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We exclude after-tax acquisition-related amortization because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions the Company consummates. We exclude the other items because they occur for reasons that may be unrelated to the Company's commercial performance during the period and/or Management believes they are not indicative of the Company's ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period. 

Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations represents adjusted earnings from continuing operations divided by average diluted shares. 

Total segment earnings (EBIT) is defined as earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, net interest expense and corporate expenses. Total segment earnings (EBIT) margin is defined as total segment earnings (EBIT) divided by revenue.

Adjusted EBIT by Segment is defined as earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, net interest expense, corporate expenses, rightsizing and other costs and a 2019 loss on assets held for sale. Adjusted EBIT Margin by Segment is defined as adjusted EBIT by segment divided by segment revenue.

Adjusted EBITDA by Segment is defined as adjusted EBIT by segment plus depreciation and amortization, excluding depreciation and amortization included within rightsizing and other costs. Adjusted EBITDA Margin by Segment is defined as adjusted EBITDA by segment divided by segment revenue.

Management believes these measures are useful to investors to better understand the Company’s ongoing profitability as it will better reflect the Company's core operating results, offer more transparency and facilitate easier comparability to prior and future periods and to its peers.

Net debt represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Net capitalization represents net debt plus stockholders' equity. Net debt to net capitalization ratio equals net debt divided by net capitalization. Management believes the net debt to net capitalization ratio is useful to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity. 

Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue equals free cash flow divided by revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations equals free cash flow divided by earnings from continuing operations. Management believes that free cash flow and free cash flow ratios are important measures of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory payment obligations and investment opportunities, such as funding acquisitions, paying dividends, repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock. 

Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, provides a useful comparison of our revenue and bookings performance and trends between periods.
