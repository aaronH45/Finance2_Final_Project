FULL-YEAR 2019 NET INCOME OF $1.2 BILLION, $7.87 PER SHARE

Earnings per Share Increased 9 Percent Compared to 2018 

Reflected Strong Loan Growth, Capital Management, Record Revenue and Expense Control 

FOURTH QUARTER 2019 NET INCOME OF $269 MILLION, $1.85 PER SHARE

Return on Equity of 15 Percent and Return on Assets of 1.5 Percent

Reflected Robust Deposit Growth, Capital Management and Strong Credit Quality

"In 2019, we realized strong loan growth, which pushed total assets to a record level while continuing to serve our relationship-oriented deposit base," said Curt C. Farmer, chairman and chief executive officer. "With the benefit of fee income growth, revenue reached an all-time high. This growth, along with careful cost control, resulted in an efficiency ratio of under 52 percent. In addition, credit quality remained solid and we meaningfully reduced excess capital. Altogether, this produced earnings per share of $7.87, a 9 percent increase over 2018, as well as a 10 percent increase in our book value, and our return on equity increased to above 16 percent. 

"With respect to the fourth quarter, our results demonstrate our ability to drive solid returns with a return on equity of nearly 15 percent and a return on assets of 1.5 percent, despite declines in interest rates. While loans were relatively stable, deposit growth was robust, increasing $1.5 billion relative to the third quarter, with over 40 percent from noninterest-bearing deposits. Noninterest income growth, strong credit quality and continued active capital management were also positive contributors to our performance. 

"As we look forward to the year ahead, we remain keenly focused on growing loans and deposits along with maintaining our proven expense discipline as we invest for the future. Our key strengths, including our diverse, geographic footprint, combined with our relationship banking strategy, provide the foundation to continue to enhance shareholder value.”

Full-Year 2019 Compared to Full-Year 2018 Overview

Balance sheet items discussed in terms of average balances.

Loans increased $1.7 billion, or 4 percent, to $50.5 billion.

•Reflected increases in Energy, Mortgage Banker Finance, National Dealer Services, general Middle Market and Commercial Real Estate.

Deposits were relatively stable at $55.5 billion.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net interest income decreased $13 million to $2.3 billion.

Excluding losses of $8 million in 2019 and $20 million in 2018 related to securities repositioning, noninterest income increased $22 million.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Also included an $11 million increase in deferred compensation asset returns (offset in noninterest expense) and a $6 million gain on the sale of Comerica's Health Savings Account (HSA) business, partially offset by decreases of $5 million due to the wind-down of a retirement savings program in 2018 and $4 million in income from tax-credit investments. 

Excluding 2018 restructuring charges of $53 million, noninterest expenses were stable.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Excluding $11 million increase in deferred compensation expense (offset in noninterest income), salaries and benefits expense was stable as merit increases and higher technology-related contingent labor costs were offset by lower incentive compensation. 

Provision for income taxes increased $34 million to $334 million.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Returned a total of $1.8 billion to shareholders, an increase of $141 million compared to 2018.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth Quarter 2019 Compared to Third Quarter 2019 Overview

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Noninterest income increased $10 million to $266 million. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Noninterest expenses increased $16 million to $451 million.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Capital position remained solid with a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.14 percent.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Interest Income

Balance sheet items discussed in terms of average balances.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net interest income decreased $42 million, and net interest margin decreased 32 basis points, compared to third quarter 2019.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Credit Quality

“Credit quality in 2019 continued to be strong with 21 basis points of net charge-offs and only 4 basis points excluding Energy. Fourth quarter net charge-offs were also low at 16 basis points and 1 basis point excluding Energy. Charge-offs continued to primarily consist of valuation impairments on select Energy credits as capital markets for this sector remain soft. Total nonperforming assets declined to one of the lowest levels since 2006 and represented 43 basis points of our total loans. Our allowance remains very healthy at a reserve ratio of 1.27 percent. We expect our portfolio to continue to perform well, yet could begin to migrate from these strong credit metrics towards our historical norm."

Full-Year 2020 Outlook

For full-year 2020 compared to full-year 2019 reported results, management expects the following, assuming a continuation of the current economic and rate environment:

•2 percent to 3 percent growth in average loans, reflecting increases in most lines of business, partly offset by declines in Mortgage Banker Finance and National Dealer Services.

•1 percent to 2 percent increase in average deposits, with a continued focus on attracting and retaining relationship-based deposits.

•Decrease in net interest income due to the net impact of lower interest rates, 2019 funding actions and lower nonaccrual interest recoveries, partially offset by loan growth.

◦$10 million to $15 million net reduction from interest rates in first quarter 2020 compared to fourth quarter 2019, with a modest decrease for the remainder of the year.

•Continued strong credit quality, with net credit-related charge-offs similar to 2019 levels (15 basis points to 25 basis points).

•1 percent growth in noninterest income, reflecting growth in card fees and fiduciary income, partially offset by lower derivative and warrant income, and assuming no returns on deferred compensation assets.

•3 percent increase in noninterest expenses, reflecting higher outside processing expenses in line with growing revenue, technology expenditures, typical inflationary pressures and higher pension expense. 

•Income tax expense to be approximately 23 percent of pre-tax income.

•Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio target of approximately 10 percent.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (unaudited)

Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries     

Comerica believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of equity and performance trends. Comerica believes the adjusted financial results provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of results with prior periods. Tangible equity is used by Comerica to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Securities repositioning refers to losses incurred on the sale of approximately $1 billion and $1.3 billion of treasury securities in 2019 and 2018, respectively, that were replaced by higher-yielding treasuries. Discrete tax items include benefits from state deferred tax adjustments in 2019, employee stock transactions, a review of certain tax capitalization and recovery positions in 2018, and a charge in 2018 to adjust deferred taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

The tangible equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and total assets. Tangible equity per share of stock removes the effect of intangible assets from shareholders equity per share of stock.
