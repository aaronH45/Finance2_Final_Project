Kansas City Southern Reports Strong Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2019 Results

Kansas City, MO., January 17, 2020. Kansas City Southern (KCS) (NYSE:KSU) reported strong fourth quarter and full year 2019 results, driven by implementation of Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) principles.

Fourth Quarter 2019

Fourth quarter revenues were $729.5 million, an increase of 5% primarily led by a 13% increase in Chemicals and Petroleum and an 11% increase in Industrial & Consumer Products as compared to fourth quarter 2018. Carloads were down 1%, as declines in Automotive and Intermodal offset carload growth in all other business units.

Fourth quarter operating expenses were $493.5 million, including $38.3 million of restructuring charges related to PSR initiatives. Operating income was $236.0 million and the reported operating ratio was 67.6%. Fourth quarter net income was $127.9 million, or $1.30 per diluted share. Adjusted fourth quarter operating income, operating ratio, net income and diluted earnings per share were as follows:

"Kansas City Southern's implementation of PSR principles has sustained momentum in the fourth quarter, driving strong results in the form of more consistent and reliable operations, improved customer service, improved cost structure and growth in shareholder returns," stated President and Chief Executive Officer, Patrick J. Ottensmeyer. "Thanks to the hard work and dedication of KCS's employees, we exited 2019 with network-wide velocity performing at record levels."

Full Year 2019

Full year 2019 revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 6% on a 1% decline in carloads. Operating income was $886.3 million and the reported operating ratio was 69.1%. Full year 2019 net income was $540.8 million, or $5.40 per diluted share. 

During 2019, KCS significantly improved its operating performance, as demonstrated by an increase in gross velocity of 22%, a decline in terminal dwell of 16%, and an improvement to car miles per day of 19% as compared to 2018. PSR initiatives also contributed directly to operating expense savings of $58.0 million in 2019, and are projected to deliver incremental savings of $61.0 million in 2020.

"Year one of KCS's PSR implementation has exceeded our own expectations for service, operational and financial improvement," stated Ottensmeyer. "As we turn our focus to 2020, we look forward to growing our business while implementing our second year of PSR initiatives. 

"These strong results have allowed us to improve guidance, and we now expect to deliver a 60% to 61% operating ratio in 2020, and below 60% in 2021. Additionally, we have improved our outlook for earnings per share growth to a mid-teens CAGR from 2019 through 2021. Finally, with improved asset utilization, we have reduced our outlook for capital expenditures to ~17% of revenue through 2022."

Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the accompanying fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. KCS management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used to review and in certain cases manage the Company's business fall within the meaning of Regulation G (Disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures) and may provide its users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison when reviewing the Company's results. KCS management uses non-GAAP information in its planning and forecasting processes and to further analyze its own financial trends and operational performance, as well as making financial comparisons to prior periods presented on a similar basis. Management believes investors and users of the Company's financial information should consider all of the above factors when evaluating KCS's results.

These non-GAAP measures should be viewed as a supplement and not considered a substitute for GAAP measures. Some of KCS's non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures.

(a)The Company believes adjusted diluted earnings per share is meaningful as it allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of adjustments to 2017 provisional income tax benefit for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and items that are not directly related to the ongoing operations of the Company. The income tax expense impacts related to these adjustments are calculated at the applicable statutory tax rate. 

(b)The Company believes adjusted operating expenses, operating income and operating ratio are meaningful as they allow investors to evaluate the Company's performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by adjusting for items that are not directly related to the ongoing operations of the Company.

(c)Operating ratio is calculated by dividing operating expenses by revenues; or in the case of adjusted operating ratio, adjusted operating expenses divided by revenues.
