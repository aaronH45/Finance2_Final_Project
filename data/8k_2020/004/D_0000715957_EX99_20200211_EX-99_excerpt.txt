Reported earnings for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2019, were $1.4 billion ($1.73 per share) compared with earnings of $2.4 billion ($3.74 per share) for the same period in 2018. 

Operating earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2019, were $988 million ($1.18 per share), compared with operating earnings of $592 million ($0.89 per share) for the same period in 2018.

Operating earnings are defined as reported earnings adjusted for certain items. Details of operating earnings as compared to prior periods, business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in reported earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2, 3 and 4 of this release.  

Operating earnings guidance 

Dominion Energy expects 2020 operating earnings in the range of $4.25 to $4.60 per share, compared to full-year 2019 operating earnings of $4.24 per share. Positive drivers include regulated investment growth across electric and gas businesses, lower financing costs due to lower average debt balances, the full-year impact of the Millstone nuclear facility zero-carbon procurement contract, and lower depreciation expense associated with an anticipated extension of the useful life assumption for our regulated nuclear plants in Virginia. The company expects negative drivers for the year to include increased minority interest expense associated with the equity recapitalization of Cove Point, share dilution, two planned refueling outages at Millstone and lower New England capacity prices. 

First-quarter 2020 operating earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.25 per share.

Important note to investors regarding operating, reported earnings 

Dominion Energy uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings guidance and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion Energy also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the Board of Directors, for the company’s incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion Energy management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company’s fundamental earnings power. 

In providing its operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, acquisitions, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. At this time, Dominion Energy management is not able to estimate the aggregate impact of these items on future period reported earnings.
