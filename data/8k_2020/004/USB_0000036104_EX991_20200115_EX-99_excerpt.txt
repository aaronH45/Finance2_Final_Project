CEO Commentary 

“As our fourth quarter financial results indicate we ended 2019 on a good note and we enter a new year, and a new decade, in a strong position. Our focus on value creation supported continued customer acquisition and deepening of existing relationships across our franchise, which in turn drove strong account and volume growth in our fee businesses and strong loan and deposit growth in our banking businesses. During the quarter, we returned $2.9 billion of earnings to shareholders through dividends and an expanded share buyback program. We remain committed to delivering best-in-class products and services and this coming year we will continue to enhance our digital capabilities aimed at improving the customer experience and making it simpler and more productive to do business with us. I want to thank our employees for all their hard work in building the solid foundation from which we will grow in 2020 and beyond.” 

— Andy Cecere, Chairman, President and CEO, U.S. Bancorp

     U.S. Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2019 Results 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $1,486 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, which was 19.9 percent lower than the $1,856 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, and 22.1 percent lower than the $1,908 million for the third quarter of 2019. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.90 in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with $1.10 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $1.15 in the third quarter of 2019. The fourth quarter of 2019 included $(0.18) per diluted common share of notable items related to restructuring charges including severance and certain asset impairments, and increased derivative liability related to Visa shares, from their initial public offering, previously sold by the Company. By comparison, the fourth quarter of 2018 included $0.03 per diluted common share of notable items related to the gain from the sale of the Company’s ATM servicing business and the sale of a majority of the Company’s FDIC covered loans, charges related to severance, certain asset impairments, an accrual for legal matters, and the favorable impact to deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in estimates from tax reform.  

The decrease in net income year-over-year was due to lower total net revenue of 2.8 percent and an increase in noninterest expense of 3.7 percent. Net interest income decreased 2.9 percent (3.0 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis), mainly a result of the impact of the yield curve and deposit and funding mix, partially offset by higher yields on reinvestment of securities in addition to loan growth. Excluding notable items in both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018, noninterest income increased 6.4 percent compared with a year ago, driven by growth in payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees, mortgage banking revenue, and higher other noninterest income, partially offset by a decrease in deposit service charges. Excluding notable items in both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018, noninterest expense increased 3.1 percent primarily due to personnel expense driven by stronger fee revenue production in mortgage activities, technology and communications expense in support of business growth, and net occupancy and equipment expense due to capital expenditures in support of business growth.  

Net income decreased on a linked quarter basis primarily due to lower total net revenue of 4.3 percent and an increase in noninterest expense of 8.2 percent. Net interest income decreased 2.3 percent primarily due to earning asset growth being more than offset by the impact of declining short-term interest rates, higher premium amortization in the investment portfolio, and earning asset mix. Excluding the notable item in the fourth quarter of 2019, noninterest income decreased 1.5 percent compared with the third quarter of 2019 driven by seasonally lower payment services revenue, commercial products revenue, and mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by higher trust and investment management fees due to core business growth and favorable market conditions. Excluding the notable items in the fourth quarter of 2019, noninterest expense increased 1.8 percent primarily driven by seasonally higher professional services expense, technology and communications expense in support of business growth, and tax credit amortization included in other noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in employee benefits expense due to seasonally lower payroll taxes.

(a) Excludes unrealized gain (loss)  

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $3,231 million, a decrease of $100 million (3.0 percent) compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease was principally driven by the impact of lower interest rates and a flatter yield curve in addition to deposit and funding mix, partially offset by higher yields on reinvestment of securities and loan growth. Average earning assets were $19.3 billion (4.6 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2018, reflecting increases of $11.2 billion (3.9 percent) in average total loans and $7.5 billion (6.6 percent) in average investment securities. Average other earning assets decreased $1.6 billion (7.9 percent).  

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis decreased $75 million (2.3 percent) on a linked quarter basis primarily driven by declining short-term interest rates, higher premium amortization in the investment securities portfolio, and the mix of earning assets. Average earning assets were $4.1 billion (0.9 percent) higher on a linked quarter basis, reflecting increases of $2.4 billion (0.8 percent) in average total loans and $4.5 billion (3.8 percent) in average investment securities. Average other earning assets decreased $3.6 billion (16.6 percent).  

The net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 2.92 percent, compared with 3.15 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 3.02 percent in the third quarter of 2019. The decrease in the net interest margin year-over-year was primarily due to the impact of declining interest rates on the yield curve in addition to deposit and funding mix. The decrease in net interest margin on a linked quarter basis reflects continued yield curve compression, premium amortization in the investment securities portfolio, and earning asset mix.  

The increase in average investment securities in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 and the third quarter of 2019 was primarily due to purchases of mortgage-backed securities, net of prepayments and maturities. At December 31, 2019, the Company transferred all held-to-maturity investment securities to its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, as a result of changes in regulatory capital requirements.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average total loans for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $11.2 billion (3.9 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was due to growth in residential mortgages (8.4 percent), total commercial loans (3.4 percent), credit card loans (7.6 percent), and other retail loans (6.1 percent). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in total commercial real estate loans (1.1 percent) given the later stage of the business cycle.  

Average total loans were $2.4 billion (0.8 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2019 primarily driven by growth in residential mortgages (1.9 percent), total commercial real estate loans (1.9 percent), and credit card loans (1.8 percent).

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Average total deposits for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $22.1 billion (6.6 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2018. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $2.8 billion (3.7 percent) year-over-year primarily due to the migration of balances to interest-bearing deposits and the continued deployment by customers of business deposits within Corporate and Commercial Banking. Average total savings deposits were $24.0 billion (11.1 percent) higher year-over-year driven by Wealth Management and Investment Services, Corporate and Commercial Banking and Consumer and Business Banking. Average time deposits were $958 million (2.3 percent) higher than the prior year quarter. Changes in time deposits are largely related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics. In addition, there was growth in consumer time deposits related to the migration of balances to higher yielding products.  

Average total deposits increased $6.5 billion (1.9 percent) from the third quarter of 2019. On a linked quarter basis, average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $281 million (0.4 percent). Average total savings deposits increased $6.3 billion (2.7 percent) on a linked quarter basis primarily due to increases in Wealth Management and Investment Services, Corporate and Commercial Banking, and Consumer and Business Banking. Average time deposits, which are managed based on funding needs, relative pricing and liquidity characteristics, increased $503 million (1.2 percent) on a linked quarter basis.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth quarter noninterest income of $2,436 million was $62 million (2.5 percent) lower than the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding notable items in both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018, noninterest income increased $154 million (6.4 percent) led by growth in payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees, mortgage banking revenue, and other noninterest income. Payment services revenue increased $11 million (1.2 percent) due to higher merchant processing services of $20 million (5.1 percent) driven by higher sales volumes and merchant fees, partially offset by slightly lower credit and debit card revenue of $4 million (1.0 percent) and corporate payment products revenue of $5 million (3.1 percent). The decline in corporate payment products revenue was driven by lower commercial business sales volumes. Trust and investment management fees increased $29 million (7.1 percent) due to business growth and favorable market conditions. Mortgage banking revenue increased $73 million (42.7 percent) driven by higher mortgage production and gain on sale margins. Other noninterest income in the fourth quarter of 2019 included a charge of $140 million for increased derivative liability related to Visa shares previously sold by the Company. Other noninterest income in the fourth quarter of 2018 included the impacts of notable items related to a gain from the sale of the Company’s ATM servicing business of $340 million and charges for asset impairments related to the sale of a majority of the Company’s covered loans and other certain assets of $264 million. Excluding these notable items, other noninterest income increased by $44 million year-over-year primarily due to a gain on the sale of a loan portfolio. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in deposit service charges of $22 million (8.7 percent) primarily due to the sale of the Company’s ATM servicing business in the fourth quarter of 2018.  

Noninterest income was $178 million (6.8 percent) lower in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with the third quarter of 2019. Excluding the fourth quarter notable item, noninterest income was $38 million (1.5 percent) lower than the third quarter of 2019, reflecting lower payment services revenue, commercial products revenue, and mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by higher trust and investment management fees. Payment services revenue decreased slightly compared with the third quarter of 2019 driven by lower corporate payment products revenue of $19 million (10.7 percent) due to seasonally lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher credit and debit card revenue of $12 million (3.3 percent) due to seasonally higher sales volumes and higher fees. Commercial products revenue was $14 million (5.8 percent) lower on a linked quarter basis driven by a seasonal reduction in corporate bond fees and trading income. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $28 million (10.3 percent) due to seasonally lower application volumes and an unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activities. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in trust and investment management fees of $17 million (4.0 percent) driven by business growth, billing cycle timing, and favorable market conditions.

Fourth quarter noninterest expense of $3,401 million was $121 million (3.7 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2018. Included in the fourth quarter were notable items related to severance charges and other accruals of $200 million in 2019 and severance charges and accruals of legal matters of $174 million in 2018. Excluding notable items from both periods, fourth quarter noninterest expense increased $95 million (3.1 percent) compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily due to increased personnel expense, higher technology and communications expense, and higher net occupancy and equipment expense. Compensation expense increased $29 million (1.8 percent) compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by the impact of hiring to support business growth, merit increases, and higher variable compensation related to business production in mortgage banking. Employee benefits expense increased $7 million (2.3 percent) primarily due to higher medical costs compared with a year ago. Technology and communications expense increased $37 million (14.6 percent) and net occupancy and equipment expense increased $20 million (7.5 percent) primarily to support business growth.  

Noninterest expense increased $257 million (8.2 percent) on a linked quarter basis. Excluding the impact of the current quarter notable items, fourth quarter noninterest expense increased $57 million (1.8 percent) primarily due to seasonally higher professional services expense of $25 million (21.9 percent) and an increase of $14 million (5.1 percent) in technology and communications expense driven by capital expenditures to support business growth. Partially offsetting these increases, employee benefits expense decreased $9 million (2.8 percent) driven by seasonally lower payroll taxes.  

Provision for Income Taxes  

The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2019 resulted in a tax rate of 20.2 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis (effective tax rate of 19.2 percent), compared with 14.6 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis (effective tax rate of 13.5 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2018, and a tax rate of 20.4 percent on a taxable-equivalent basis (effective tax rate of 19.6 percent) in the third quarter of 2019. The fourth quarter of 2018 tax rates reflected the favorable impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments related to tax reform estimates. Excluding the changes in estimates related to deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2018, the taxable-equivalent rate was 20.1 percent.

Credit quality was relatively stable on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis. The Company’s provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $395 million, which was $28 million (7.6 percent) higher than the prior quarter and $27 million (7.3 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting loan growth.  

Total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2019 were $385 million, compared with $352 million in the third quarter of 2019, and $353 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Net charge-offs increased $33 million (9.4 percent) compared with the third quarter of 2019 mainly due to seasonally lower credit card net charge-offs in the third quarter and higher total other retail net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs increased $32 million (9.1 percent) compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher total commercial, total commercial real estate, and credit card net charge-offs, in line with loan growth. The net charge-off ratio was 0.52 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with 0.48 percent in in the third quarter of 2019 and 0.49 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018.

The year-over-year decrease in nonperforming assets was driven by improvements in nonperforming residential mortgages, total commercial real estate loans, other retail loans, and other real estate owned. Accruing loans 90 days or more past due were $605 million at December 31, 2019, compared with $600 million at September 30, 2019, and $584 million at December 31, 2018.

These forward-looking statements cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the future plans and prospects of U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Deterioration in general business and economic conditions or turbulence in domestic or global financial markets could adversely affect U.S. Bancorp’s revenues and the values of its assets and liabilities, reduce the availability of funding to certain financial institutions, lead to a tightening of credit, and increase stock price volatility. Stress in the commercial real estate markets, as well as a downturn in the residential real estate markets, could cause credit losses and deterioration in asset values. In addition, changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies or practices could affect U.S. Bancorp in substantial and unpredictable ways. U.S. Bancorp’s results could also be adversely affected by changes in interest rates; deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolios or in the value of the collateral securing those loans; deterioration in the value of its investment securities; legal and regulatory developments; litigation; increased competition from both banks and non-banks; changes in the level of tariffs and other trade policies of the United States and its global trading partners; changes in customer behavior and preferences; breaches in data security; failures to safeguard personal information; effects of mergers and acquisitions and related integration; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments; and management’s ability to effectively manage credit risk, market risk, operational risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and reputational risk.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including: 

   •    

Tangible common equity to tangible assets    

   •    

Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets    

   •    

Return on tangible common equity    

These capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of evaluating the Company’s utilization of its capital held and the level of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company’s capital position relative to other financial services companies. These capital measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), or are not defined in banking regulations. As a result, these capital measures disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. The effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations for these periods were subject to certain transitional provisions. Management believes this information helps investors assess trends in the Company’s capital adequacy.  

The Company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also be considered non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. In addition, certain performance measures, including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin utilize net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.  

There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this press release in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. A table follows that shows the Company’s calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures.

Lines of Business  

The Company’s major lines of business are Corporate and Commercial Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Wealth Management and Investment Services, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that directly support another business line’s operations are charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization of those services, primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within noninterest expense. Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a managerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support. Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company’s diverse customer base. During 2019, certain organization and methodology changes were made and, accordingly, prior period results were restated and presented on a comparable basis.

Corporate and Commercial Banking offers lending, equipment finance and small-ticket leasing, depository services, treasury management, capital markets services, international trade services and other financial services to middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit and public sector clients.  

Corporate and Commercial Banking contributed $355 million of the Company’s net income in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with $397 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Total net revenue decreased $42 million (4.4 percent) due to a decrease of $29 million (3.9 percent) in net interest income and a decrease of $13 million (6.1 percent) in total noninterest income. Net interest income decreased primarily due to lower noninterest bearing deposit balances compared with the prior year, loan mix, and lower spreads on loans, reflecting a competitive marketplace, partially offset by loan and interest-bearing deposit growth. Noninterest bearing deposits are declining as customers deploy balances to support business growth. Total noninterest income decreased year-over-year primarily due to lower capital markets revenue, partially offset by higher trading revenue and corporate bond underwriting fees. Total noninterest expense was $8 million (2.0 percent) lower compared with a year ago primarily due to lower FDIC assessment costs and lower legal and professional expense, partially offset by higher loan costs. The provision for credit losses increased $23 million (82.1 percent) primarily due to higher net charge-offs.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Consumer and Business Banking delivers products and services through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail, ATM processing and mobile devices. It encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking and indirect lending, as well as mortgage banking.  

Consumer and Business Banking contributed $526 million of the Company’s net income in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with $571 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Total net revenue increased $21 million (1.0 percent) reflecting a decrease in net interest income of $34 million (2.2 percent) and an increase of $55 million (9.8 percent) in total noninterest income. Net interest income decreased primarily due to lower spreads on loans driven by the decline in interest rates, partially offset by growth in noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposit balances as well as higher loan volumes. Total noninterest income increased primarily due to higher mortgage banking revenue driven by higher production and gain on sale margins, partially offset by the reduction in ATM processing services revenue due to the sale of the Company’s ATM third-party servicing business in 2018. Total noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2019 increased $56 million (4.3 percent) primarily due to higher net shared services expense, reflecting the impact of technology development and investment in infrastructure supporting business growth, as well as costs to manage the business and higher production incentives in support of business growth. Partially offsetting these increases were lower FDIC assessment costs. The provision for credit losses increased $24 million (35.3 percent) primarily due to an unfavorable change in the reserve allocation, partially offset by lower net charge-offs.

Net interest income decreased primarily due to funding mix, partially offset by growth in the investment portfolio. Total noninterest income decreased year-over-year primarily due to notable items in both quarters. The fourth quarter of 2019 notable item was for an increased derivative liability related to Visa shares previously sold by the Company, while fourth quarter of 2018 notable items related to the gain on sale of the Company’s ATM servicing business, offset by certain asset impairments. The impact of the notable items is partially offset by a gain on the sale of a loan portfolio and an increase in gains on the sale of securities. Total noninterest expense increased $67 million (20.5 percent) year-over-year primarily due to notable items booked in both quarters. Included in the fourth quarter are notable items related to severance charges and other accruals in 2019 and severance charges and accruals of legal matters in 2018. In addition to the notable items, noninterest expense increased due to higher compensation expense, reflecting the impact of increased staffing and merit increases, and higher implementation costs of capital investments to support business growth. These increases were partially offset by lower net shared services expense and lower costs related to tax-advantaged projects. The provision for credit losses decreased $20 million reflecting a favorable change in the reserve allocation and lower net charge-offs.
