Returns were then aggregated to show the total excess returns for each Retirement Fund sector-weighted benchmark. Excess returns were calculated for each rolling period and then averaged across all the periods in each time frame. 2Value added is calculated by comparing the returns of the 11 Retirement Funds with a 10-year track record using each fund’s fixed strategic asset allocation versus the returns based on the actual allocation weights. 3Value added—net of fees and other costs—is calculated for the underlying funds in the 11 Retirement Funds with a 10-year track record. Returns were calculated relative to each underlying fund’s style-specific benchmark. Returns were then aggregated to show the total excess returns for each Retirement Fund. Excess returns were calculated for each rolling period and then averaged across all the periods in each time frame. 1,2,3For each of the 3 design components, to provide a high-level summary, a time-weighted performance average was calculated to determine the percentage of the total rolling periods in each time frame in which the design component made a positive contribution to fund returns. Value added is the return contribution made by each design component. Excess returns were calculated for each rolling period and then averaged across all the periods in each time frame. T.
