Management Commentary 

William J. Stromberg, president and chief executive officer, commented: "2019 was an excellent year for the firm as we continued to deliver strong long-term investment performance, provide outstanding client service, advance our strategic priorities, and deliver attractive financial results for our stockholders. Organic assets under management (AUM) growth for the year was 1.4% and was broadly diversified across asset classes, channels, and client geographies. Average AUM and revenues were supported by both net flows and strong markets, and non-GAAP operating expenses were well controlled, resulting in strong adjusted net income. We also continued to return capital to stockholders by increasing our annual dividend 8.6%, and opportunistically repurchasing nearly 3% of our outstanding stock at an average price of $101.65. 

“In the fourth quarter, we saw positive net flows of $2.8 billion driven by our multi-asset franchise, which had its highest Q4 for target date flows since 2014. International equity was also a notable contributor, as was the APAC region which saw strong inflows into the recently-launched Growth Stock Japanese Investment Trust (ITM). The pace of operating expense growth picked up relative to the first three quarters of the year, largely as a result of increased hiring and the deployment of professional fees that we initially planned to spend earlier in 2019, as teams continued to execute against their plans. Highlights for the quarter include:

▪The SEC's approval of our application for semi-transparent active ETFs. As a next step, the NYSE Arca filed an application with the SEC under Rule 19b-4 in December in order to amend its trading rules to list our semi-transparent ETFs. We also filed registration statements with the SEC for our products and hope to be in market in 2020 with four of our flagship U.S. equity strategies - Blue Chip Growth, Growth Stock, Dividend Growth, and Equity Income.

▪Continued development of our long-term strategic product pipeline and the launch of three new products for the firm - Growth Stock ITM, Dynamic Credit Fund SICAV, and China Evolution Equity Fund, our first mutual fund focused solely on Chinese equities.

▪The launch of a number of new features and digital enhancements for our individual investor and recordkeeping clients. Specific to recordkeeping clients, we enhanced the participant homepage, which serves as the hub of our multichannel engagement experience, and announced an integrated health savings account solution in partnership with ConnectYourCare.

“I am very pleased with the progress we made in 2019 and look forward to continuing to execute against our strategic priorities in 2020, enabling us to continue to deliver strong performance and service to our clients. I remain grateful to our associates around the world for their contributions to our results."

Assets Under Management

During Q4 2019, assets under management increased $80.5 billion to $1.21 trillion. Net cash inflows were 

$2.8 billion, and clients transferred $3.7 billion in net assets from the U.S. mutual funds to other investment products, primarily the target date trusts. The components of the change in assets under management, by vehicle and asset class, are shown in the tables below.

(1) The underlying assets under management of the multi-asset portfolios have been aggregated and presented in this category and not reported in the equity and fixed income columns.

(2) Includes distributions reinvested and not reinvested.

Assets under management in the firm's target date retirement products, which are reported as part of the multi-asset column in the table above, were $292.4 billion at December 31, 2019, compared with $272.0 billion at 

September 30, 2019 and $230.4 billion at December 31, 2018. Net cash inflows into these portfolios were 

$3.2 billion in Q4 2019 and $9.8 billion for 2019. 

Investors domiciled outside the United States accounted for 6.9% of the firm's assets under management at December 31, 2019 and 6.2% at December 31, 2018.

Financial Results

Net Revenues earned in Q4 2019 were $1.5 billion, up 12.5% from Q4 2018.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Q4 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increased recordkeeping fees from higher assets under management and participant transactions, partially offset by lower mutual fund servicing revenue. 

Operating expenses in Q4 2019 were $888.4 million, an increase of 16.5% over Q4 2018, of which nearly 45% was driven by a significant increase in market-related compensation expense related to the supplemental saving plan as well as the absence in 2019 of a $15.2 million reduction in 2018 operating expenses related to the conclusion of the Dell appraisal rights matter. The higher expense related to the supplemental savings plan is partially offset by the non-operating gains earned on the investments used to economically hedge the related liability. On a non-GAAP basis, the firm's operating expenses in Q4 2019 were $863.5 million, an 8.7% increase over Q4 2018. The increase in non-GAAP operating expenses, as well as the remaining increase in GAAP expenses, is largely attributable to higher headcount, the firm's continued strategic investments, and higher bonus and stock-based compensation expense, which is driven by the firm's operating results. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

December 31, 2019, an increase of 4.9% from the end of 2018.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2019, operating expenses on a GAAP basis increased 7.3% compared to 2018, and, on a non-GAAP basis, increased 4.1%. The firm currently expects its 2020 non-GAAP operating expense growth to be in the range of 6% to 9%. This expense growth guidance includes continued investments in the business and technology capabilities, the firm's cost optimization efforts, and the final part of the phased implementation of paying for all third-party investment research. As such, 2020 operating expenses will reflect a full year of all third-party investment research costs globally. The firm could elect to adjust its expense growth should unforeseen circumstances arise, including significant market movements.

Non-operating income was $170.0 million in Q4 2019, as strong equity markets led to gains in our investment portfolio as opposed to weak equity markets in Q4 2018 that led to losses of $151.9 million. The firm's consolidated investment products were the primary contributor to the net gains recognized in Q4 2019. Cash and discretionary investments added $27.2 million in gains during the 2019 quarter. The components of non-operating income for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2019 and 2018 are included in the tables at the end of this release. 

Income Taxes. The firm's effective tax rate was 20.8% in Q4 2019 compared with 30.3% in Q4 2018. These rates contribute to effective tax rates of 23.2% and 25.8% for the full year of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The firm's lower effective tax rate for Q4 2019 as compared to the 2018 quarter was driven primarily by the higher net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests held in the firm's consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products, which is not taxable to the firm despite being included in pre-tax income. Higher tax benefits associated with our stock-based awards and a lower state effective tax rate in 2019 from new Maryland state tax legislation enacted in 2018 also contributed to the lower rate. The 2018 year also includes nonrecurring charges totaling 

$28.7 million related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform and Maryland state tax legislation.

Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation

The firm believes the non-GAAP financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about its core operating results. These measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating the firm's core business, for comparing current results with prior period results, and to enable more appropriate comparison with industry peers. However, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies. 

The following schedules reconcile U.S. GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

The following schedules reconcile certain U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) These non-GAAP adjustments remove the impact the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products have on the firm's U.S. GAAP consolidated statements of income. Specifically, the firm adds back the operating expenses and subtracts the investment income of the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products. The adjustment to operating expenses represents the operating expenses of the consolidated products, net of the elimination of related management and administrative fees. The adjustment to net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group represents the net income of the consolidated products, net of redeemable non-controlling interests. Management believes the consolidated T. Rowe Price investment products may impact the reader’s ability to understand the firm's core operating results.

(2) This non-GAAP adjustment removes the compensation expense from market valuation changes in the supplemental savings plan liability and the related net gains (losses) on investments designated as an economic hedge against the related liability. Amounts deferred under the supplemental savings plan are adjusted for appreciation (depreciation) of hypothetical investments chosen by participants. The firm uses T. Rowe Price investment products to economically hedge the exposure to these market movements. Management believes it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income (loss) realized on the hedges against the related compensation expense and remove the net impact to help the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results and to increase comparability period to period.

(3) This non-GAAP adjustment represents the other non-operating income (loss) and the net gains (losses) earned on the firm's non-consolidated investment portfolio that are not designated as economic hedges of the supplemental savings plan liability, and, beginning in the second quarter of 2018, those non-consolidated investments that are not part of the cash and discretionary investment portfolio. In the second quarter of 2018, management decided to retain the investment gains recognized on the non-consolidated cash and discretionary investments as these assets and related income (loss) are considered part of the firm's core operations. The impact on previously reported non-GAAP measures is immaterial. Management believes adjusting for these non-operating income (loss) items helps the reader’s ability to understand the 

14

firm's core operating results and increases comparability to prior years. Additionally, management does not emphasize the impact of the portion of non-operating income (loss) removed when managing and evaluating the firm's performance.

(4) During the second quarter of 2018, the firm recognized a nonrecurring charge of $20.8 million for an adjustment made to the charge taken in 2017 related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform. Management believes it is useful to readers of its consolidated statements of income to adjust for this nonrecurring charge in arriving at net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group and diluted earnings per share.

(5) During the second quarter of 2018, the firm recognized a nonrecurring charge of $7.9 million for the remeasurement of its deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the effect of Maryland state tax legislation enacted on April 24, 2018. Management believes it is useful to readers of its consolidated statements of income to adjust for this nonrecurring charge in arriving at net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group and diluted earnings per share.

(6) Prior to 2018, we recognized a net $16.2 million non-recurring charge in operating expenses from compensation paid to clients and subsequent insurance recoveries related to the Dell appraisal rights matter. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized an additional non-recurring $15.2 million reduction in operating expenses upon the recovery of a portion of the the payments made to our clients in prior years. Like in prior years, we believe it is useful to our readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust for this non-recurring recovery in arriving at adjusted operating expenses, net operating income, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group and diluted earnings per share.

(8) This non-GAAP measure was calculated by applying the two-class method to adjusted net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution. The calculation of adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders is as follows:
