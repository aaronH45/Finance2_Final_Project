New York, NY, February 6, 2020 – S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) today reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 results. The Company reported fourth quarter 2019 revenue of $1.74 billion, an increase of 13% compared to the same period in 2018 with growth in all four businesses. 

Fourth quarter net income increased 6% to $541 million and diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $2.20. Both increased due to revenue growth and productivity improvements partially offset by investment spending, payments associated with the early retirement of Company bonds, and a higher effective tax rate. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter increased 11% to $621 million due to revenue growth and productivity improvements partially offset by investment spending and a higher effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $2.53. Pre-tax adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled $106 million primarily due to payments associated with the early retirement of Company bonds, deal-related amortization, restructuring charges, and Kensho retention-related expenses.

For the full year, revenue increased 7% to $6.70 billion. 2019 net income increased 8% to $2.12 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $8.60. 2019 adjusted net income increased 9% to $2.35 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $9.53.

“During 2019, we successfully launched several new products, advanced numerous automation and productivity projects, and through a handful of acquisitions added unique new data sets, products, and services,” said Douglas L. Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer of S&P Global. He added, “While we are pleased with these accomplishments, there is much more to achieve. Again in 2020, we will invest 

Page 1

in initiatives to advance our technology, create innovative new products, and expand globally. Much of the funding for these investments will be delivered through productivity and automation projects. With the capabilities we have, and those that we are building, we are even better positioned to provide the intelligence essential to advance progress.” 

Profit Margin: For the full year, the Company’s operating profit margin improved by 360 basis points to 48.2% as the Company continued to achieve revenue growth and successfully deliver productivity improvements. The adjusted operating profit margin improved by 140 basis points to 50.2% in 2019.

Return of Capital: The Company returned $1.8 billion to shareholders in 2019 with $1.2 billion in share repurchases and $560 million in dividends. Share repurchases drove more than a 2% reduction in diluted weighted average shares outstanding during 2019. Beginning later this month, the Company expects to initiate a new $1 billion ASR program that will conclude no later than July 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 4.7 million shares remaining in its existing repurchase authority and on January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company granted an additional repurchase authority of 30 million shares.

Dividend: On January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors of S&P Global approved a 17.5% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend on the Company’s common stock. The quarterly dividend will increase from $0.57 to $0.67 per share. The next dividend is payable on March 11, 2020, to shareholders of record on February 26, 2020. The new annualized dividend rate is $2.68 per share and has increased at an average compound annual growth rate of 10.1% since 1974. The Company has paid a dividend each year since 1937 and is one of only 24 companies in the S&P 500 that has increased its dividend annually for at least the last 47 years.

Strategy Update: At our Investor Day in May 2018, the Company initiated several medium-term aspirational targets. The first was a $100 million target for cost reduction savings. The Company estimates that, on a run-rate basis, $85 million in savings was achieved by year-end 2019. The second was to improve the adjusted operating profit margin for the Company from 46.5% at the end of 2017 to the low-50’s over the next few years. After achieving 230 basis points of improvement in 2018, the Company achieved an additional 140 basis points of improvement in 2019, reaching 50.2%. The Company will continue to work toward full achievement of these aspirational targets.

Ratings: 

4th Quarter, 2019: Revenue increased 24% to $820 million. Non-transaction revenue increased 2% to $391 million during the quarter primarily due to increased fees associated with surveillance and intersegment royalties. Transaction revenue increased 55% to $429 million in the fourth quarter primarily due to strong bond rating activity offset partially by lower bank loan rating revenue. 

Operating profit increased 33% to $473 million due to increased revenue. Operating profit margin increased 370 basis points to 57.7% in the quarter primarily due to increased revenue and productivity improvements offset partially by increased incentive compensation in the current period. Adjusted operating profit increased 29% to $473 million and adjusted operating profit margin improved 220 basis points to 57.7% in the quarter.

2019: Revenue increased 8% to $3.11 billion due primarily to increased global bond issuance offset partially by lower bank loan rating revenue. Operating profit increased 15% to $1.76 billion and operating profit margin improved 380 basis points to 56.8% primarily due to revenue growth and productivity improvements offset partially by increased incentive compensation. Adjusted operating profit increased 10% to $1.78 billion compared to 2018 and adjusted operating profit margin improved 120 basis points to 57.2%.

Industry inflows into exchange-traded products reached $509 billion in 2019, of which $58 billion was added to ETFs associated with our indices. Year-end 2019 ETF AUM associated with our indices increased 30% from year-end 2018 to $1.7 trillion as a result of both stock market gains and fund inflows. Market volatility was lower in 2019 than 2018 resulting in decreased revenue associated with exchange-traded derivatives. 

4th Quarter, 2019: Revenue increased 9% to $233 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Revenue improved primarily due to increased asset-linked fees offset partially by decreased derivatives trading activity. Average AUM in exchange-traded funds based on SPDJI’s indices was $1.6 trillion in the quarter, an increase of 16% versus the fourth quarter of 2018. 

Operating profit increased 10% to $157 million and operating profit margin increased 80 basis points to 67.2% primarily due to stronger revenue.

2019: Revenue increased 7% to $1.96 billion.

Corporate Unallocated:

Corporate Unallocated includes non-allocated corporate expenses; however, 2018 also includes Kensho revenue which, starting in 2019, is included in Market Intelligence. 

4th Quarter, 2019:  Corporate Unallocated operating loss increased by 15% to $(62) million primarily due to increased incentive compensation, professional fees, and restructuring partially offset by a reduction of Kensho retention-related expenses. Corporate Unallocated adjusted operating loss increased by 27% to $(45) million due to increased incentive compensation and professional fees. 

2019: Corporate Unallocated operating loss improved by 8% to $(212) million primarily due to a $20 million contribution to the S&P Global Foundation in 2018, a reduction of Kensho retention-related expenses, and lower professional fees. Corporate Unallocated adjusted operating loss improved by 7% to $(145) million primarily due to the contribution to the S&P Global Foundation in 2018 and lower professional fees.

Provision for Income Taxes: The Company’s effective tax rates in 2019 and 2018 were 21.4% and 20.9%, respectively. This increase was due primarily to additional accruals for potential tax liabilities for prior years. The adjusted effective tax rates in 2019 and 2018 were 21.7% and 21.5%, respectively.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow: Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter were $2.9 billion. For full-year 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $2.78 billion. Free cash flow was $2.52 billion, an increase of $721 million from 2018. Free cash flow, excluding tax audit settlements, tax on gains from divestitures, and the after-tax payments associated with legal settlements, was $2.58 billion, an increase of $577 million over 2018. In order to take advantage of historically low interest rates, during the fourth quarter the Company purchased $0.8 billion of outstanding debt and issued $1.1 billion in lower cost debt.

Outlook: The Company is introducing 2020 guidance with reported revenue expected to increase mid to high single-digits. On a U.S. GAAP basis, diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $10.00 to $10.20 and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $10.40 to $10.60. Adjusted diluted EPS excludes amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions and Kensho retention plans. Free cash flow excluding certain items is expected to be in a range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion.

Comparison of Adjusted Information to U.S. GAAP Information: The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company also refers to and presents certain additional non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These measures are: adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted net income, adjusted operating profit and margin, organic revenue, adjusted Corporate Unallocated, adjusted effective tax rates, adjusted diluted EPS guidance, free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items. The Company has included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP on Exhibits 5, 7, and 8. Reconciliations of certain forward looking non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures are not available due to the challenges and impracticability with estimating some of the items. The 

Page 4

Company is not able to provide reconciliations of such forward looking non-GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Because of those challenges, reconciliations of such forward looking non-GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort.

The Company’s non-GAAP measures include adjustments that reflect how management views our businesses. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that, in the case of non-GAAP financial measures other than free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items, enables investors to better compare the Company’s performance across periods, and management also uses these measures internally to assess the operating performance of its business, to assess performance for employee compensation purposes and to decide how to allocate resources. The Company believes that the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management and that such measures are useful in evaluating the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, and repurchase stock. However, investors should not consider any of these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports.
