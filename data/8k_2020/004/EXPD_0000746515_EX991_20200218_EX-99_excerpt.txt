FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

EXPEDITORS REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER 2019 EPS OF $0.79 

SEATTLE, WASHINGTON - February 18, 2020, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) today announced fourth quarter 2019 financial results including the following highlights compared to the same quarter of 2018: 

•  

Diluted Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders per share (EPS1) decreased 23% to $0.79 

•  

Net Earnings Attributable to Shareholders decreased 23% to $137 million 

•  

Operating Income decreased 17% to $180 million 

•  

Revenues decreased 9% to $2.0 billion 

•  

Airfreight tonnage volume decreased 6% and ocean container volume decreased 13% 

“Our final financial results for the fourth quarter were within the range of earnings guidance we issued last month,” said Jeffrey S. Musser, President and Chief Executive Officer. “As noted in that guidance, we do not believe this comparatively soft fourth quarter is the result of a business performance issue, but is instead more closely tied to the business environment in which we are operating. Average sell rates declined faster than our average buy rates, and both air and ocean volumes declined as slowing trade to and from China impacted overall freight movement around the globe. In the year-ago fourth quarter, by comparison, we believe our volumes benefitted as shippers moved product ahead of scheduled tariff increases.” 

Mr. Musser continued: “Our people and operations in China are a very important part of our global network. China imports and exports are interrelated to all of our other geographic regions and, on a stand-alone basis, represented 26% of our consolidated revenue and 27% of operating income in 2019. While we would normally expect softness in the first part of Q1 because of the Chinese Lunar New Year Holidays, this year has been much more pronounced due to the extended closures of factories in China in support of containing the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). There remains a great deal of uncertainty as to when factories will return to full production, and those delays will have a significant impact on freight volumes moved in Q1. In addition to traditional supply chain movements, we also believe this may have a further impact to global supply chains through potential shortages of raw materials, parts and supplies. 

“Over our 40-year history, we have experienced many events that have disrupted supply chains. We have not, however, experienced a situation where manufacturing capability has been shut-down or severely hampered to such an extent, so it is difficult to predict how this will play out. However, we remain steadfastly optimistic that when the marketplace does return to normal, we are in an excellent position to take advantage of what could be a sharp rebound in trade.” 

Bradley S. Powell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, added, “Operating income in Q4 2019 was negatively impacted by lower volumes and lower average sell rates. The largest decline in volumes and rates were experienced in our China operations where revenues and operating income declined 27% and 23%, respectively, in the fourth quarter. We will continue to make important investments in people and technology to support our long-term growth initiatives.” Mr. Powell noted that the Company’s effective tax rate for the full year of 2019 was 25.6%, compared to 24.3% in 2018. The effect of higher average tax rates of our international subsidiaries, when compared to U.S. federal and state tax rates, were offset by U.S. foreign tax credits and U.S. income tax deductions for Foreign-derived intangible income (FDII). In addition, both 2019 and 2018 benefited from state income tax refunds. These benefits were partially offset by certain expenses that are no longer deductible under the 2017 Tax Act. Mr. Powell reiterated that the Company’s effective tax rate will be largely dependent upon the mix of pre-tax earnings that are generated in its U.S. versus foreign operations, as well as any further interpretations and guidance issued on the tax law in the future.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

1In 2019, the Company revised its process to record the transfer, between its geographic operating segments, of revenues and the directly related cost of transportation expenses for freight service transactions between Company origin and destination locations. This change better aligns revenue reporting with the location where the services are performed, as well as the transactional reporting being developed as part of the Company’s new accounting systems and processes. Prior year segment revenues have not been revised. The change in presentation had no impact on consolidated or segment operating income. The 2019 results also include the effect of changing the presentation of certain import services from a net to a gross basis, which increased segment revenues and directly related operating expenses but did not change operating income. The impact of these changes on reported segment revenues was immaterial and prior year segment revenues have not been revised. 

2Directly related cost of transportation and other expenses totals Operating Expenses from Airfreight services, Ocean freight and ocean services and Customs brokerage and other services as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

3Salaries and other operating expenses totals Salaries and related, Rent and occupancy, Depreciation and amortization, Selling and promotion and Other as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
