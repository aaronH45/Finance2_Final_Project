CME Group Inc. Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2019 Financial Results

CHICAGO, February 12, 2020 - CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ: CME) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2019. 

The company reported revenue of $1.1 billion and operating income of $573 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. Net income was $469 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.31. On an adjusted basis, net income was $544 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.52. Financial results presented on an adjusted basis for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018 exclude certain items, which are detailed in the reconciliation of non-GAAP results.1 

Total revenue for full-year 2019 was $4.9 billion and operating income was $2.6 billion. Net income was $2.1 billion and diluted earnings per share were $5.91. On an adjusted basis, net income was $2.4 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $6.80.

"During 2019, we delivered significant client value and efficiencies through the continued, successful integration of the NEX business and the introduction of innovative new products,” said CME Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Duffy. “At the same time, international clients turned to our markets to manage risk in record numbers, driven by double-digit increases in Asia and Latin America. Year to date, trading volume has increased, especially in commodities, which points to the diversity of our product offering amid rising volatility and uncertainty. Looking ahead, we remain focused on a number of integration milestones, including the launch of BrokerTec fixed income markets alongside our benchmark futures and options on CME Globex in 2020."

Fourth-quarter 2019 average daily volume (ADV) was 16.9 million contracts, down 19% compared with the strong fourth-quarter 2018. Non-U.S. ADV for full-year 2019 reached a record 4.9 million contracts, up 10% compared with full-year 2018, including 7% growth in Europe, 20% growth in Asia and 47% growth in Latin America.
