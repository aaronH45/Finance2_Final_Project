Item 8.01. Other Events

Over the course of the next few years, the Company plans to take additional actions to reduce existing structural costs.

The resulting annual cost savings are expected to be in the range of approximately $90 million to $100 million by 2023. The Company plans to utilize these savings to sustain the Company’s strong operating margin profile and long-term cost competitiveness.

Forward Looking Statements

Statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K (“Form 8-K”) may constitute forward-looking statements as contemplated by the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (the “Act”) that are based on management's current outlook, expectations, estimates and projections. Words such as "anticipates," "believes," "continues," "could," "designed," "effect," "estimates," "evaluates," "expects," "forecasts," "goal," "initiative," "intends," "outlook," "plans," "potential," "project," "pursue," "seek," "should," "target," "when," "would," and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Further, all statements, other than statements of historical fact contained or incorporated by reference in this Form 8-K that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future regarding our financial position, business strategy and measures to implement that strategy, including changes to operations, competitive strengths, goals, expansion and growth of our business and operations, plans, references to future success and other such matters, are forward-looking statements. Accounting estimates, such as those described under the heading "Critical Accounting Policies" in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (“Form 10-K”), are inherently forward-looking. All forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and the Company's actual results may differ materially from those expressed, projected, or implied in or by the forward-looking statements.

You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 8-K. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed, projected or implied in or by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, among others, include: uncertainties concerning the actions the Company intends to take to reduce existing structural costs, including the specific nature of the actions, the ability, timing and costs to complete them, and the ability to realize expected savings upon their completion; our dependence on automotive and truck production, both of which are highly cyclical; our reliance on major OEM customers; our dependence on key management; the uncertainty of the global economic environment; future changes in laws and regulations, including, by way of example, tariffs, in the countries in which we operate; and the other risks noted in reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our most recently-filed Form 10-K. We do not undertake any obligation to update or announce publicly any updates to or revisions to any of the forward-looking statements in this Form 8-K to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, circumstances, or assumptions underlying the statements.
