The company has included financial measures throughout this earnings release that are not in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that these measures, when presented in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measures, are useful to both management and its investors in analyzing the company’s ongoing business and operating performance. Consequently, management uses these non-GAAP (Adjusted) financial measures as indicators of the company’s business performance, as well as for operational planning and decision making purposes. Non-GAAP (Adjusted) financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. All financial measures in this press release are in accordance with GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Please refer to the footnotes for a detailed description of each item adjusted out of GAAP financial measures to arrive at a non-GAAP (Adjusted) financial measure.

"We are pleased with our 2019 performance, particularly our success in balancing and executing on multiple priorities as we grew membership, improved the quality and productivity of our operations, and continued to invest in the long-term," said Bruce D. Broussard, Humana’s President and Chief Executive Officer. "You’ll find evidence of these efforts in our improved Net Promoter Score - and in the related, and numerous, awards we received for customer experience. In addition, we had strong membership growth, with a record number of our members now in 4+ Star Plans. All the while, we made appreciable progress in advancing our technology, primary care and home strategies."

Summary of 4Q19 Results

GAAP and Adjusted EPS results for both the quarter and the year exceeded management's expectations driven by continued outperformance in the company's Medicare Advantage business. 

In year-over-year comparisons for both 4Q19 and FY 2019, the company's GAAP and Adjusted pretax income and EPS results were favorably impacted by the solid performance of the company's Medicare Advantage business and Healthcare Services segment, with further benefit from achieving significant operating cost efficiencies in 2019 as a result of previously implemented productivity initiatives. These year-over-year favorable impacts were partially offset by the strategic investments in the company's integrated care delivery model; the impact of higher compensation accruals for the Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) offered to employees across all levels of the company; lower Group and Specialty segment earnings; increased spending associated with the 2020 Medicare Annual Election Period (AEP); and the impact of workforce optimization.

The year-over-year changes in GAAP and Adjusted EPS for 4Q19 and FY 2019 were further positively impacted by a lower tax rate primarily resulting from the suspension of the health insurance industry fee (HIF) in 2019, as well as a lower number of shares used to compute EPS, primarily reflective of share repurchases.

Please refer to the tables above and the consolidated and segment highlight sections in the detailed earnings release for additional discussion of the factors impacting year-over-year results. In addition, below is a summary of key consolidated and segment statistics comparing 4Q19 to 4Q18 and FY 2019 to FY 2018.

"We enter 2020 with positive momentum from strong 2019 results and industry-leading individual Medicare Advantage membership growth," said Brian A. Kane, Chief Financial Officer. “Seniors are increasingly choosing Medicare Advantage plans, and Humana’s value proposition, consumer orientation and strong brand resonate in the market as we work to drive better clinical outcomes for our members supporting our strong earnings growth and reinvestment in our products. We expect 2020 to be another good year for the company with solid top and bottom line growth notwithstanding the return of the health insurance industry fee."

Cautionary Statement

This news release includes forward-looking statements regarding Humana within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in investor presentations, press releases, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of Humana’s executive officers, the words or phrases like “expects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “likely will result,” “estimates,” “projects” or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. 

These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of the company’s SEC filings, a summary of which includes but is not limited to the following: 

•If Humana does not design and price its products properly and competitively, if the premiums Humana receives are insufficient to cover the cost of healthcare services delivered to its members, if the company is unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better healthcare experience for its members, lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of its members, or if its estimates of benefits expense are inadequate, Humana’s profitability could be materially adversely affected. Humana estimates the costs of its benefit expense payments, and designs and prices its products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. The company continually reviews estimates of future payments relating to benefit expenses for services incurred in the current and prior periods and makes necessary adjustments to its reserves, including premium deficiency reserves, where appropriate. These estimates, however, involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends, so any reserves the company may establish, including premium deficiency reserves, may be insufficient. 

•If Humana fails to effectively implement its operational and strategic initiatives, particularly its Medicare initiatives and state-based contract strategy, the company’s business may be materially adversely affected, which is of particular importance given the concentration of the company’s revenues in these products. In addition, there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in maintaining or improving its Star ratings in future years. 

•If Humana fails to properly maintain the integrity of its data, to strategically implement new information systems, to protect Humana’s proprietary rights to its systems, or to defend against cyber-security attacks or prevent other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information, the company’s business may be materially adversely affected. 

•Humana is involved in various legal actions, or disputes that could lead to legal actions (such as, among other things, provider contract disputes and qui tam litigation brought by individuals on behalf of the government), governmental and internal investigations, and routine internal review of business processes any of which, if resolved unfavorably to the company, could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in its business practices. Increased litigation and negative publicity could also increase the company’s cost of doing business. 

•As a government contractor, Humana is exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect its business or its willingness or ability to participate in government healthcare programs including, among other 

6

things, loss of material government contracts, governmental audits and investigations, potential inadequacy of government determined payment rates, potential restrictions on profitability, including by comparison of profitability of the company’s Medicare Advantage business to non-Medicare Advantage business, or other changes in the governmental programs in which Humana participates. Changes to the risk-adjustment model utilized by CMS to adjust premiums paid to Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans according to the health status of covered members, including proposed changes to the methodology used by CMS for risk adjustment data validation audits that fail to address adequately the statutory requirement of actuarial equivalence, if implemented, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.

•The Healthcare Reform Law, including The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, could have a material adverse effect on Humana’s results of operations, including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting the company’s ability to expand into new markets, increasing the company’s medical and operating costs by, among other things, requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products, lowering the company’s Medicare payment rates and increasing the company’s expenses associated with a non-deductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments; the company’s financial position, including the company’s ability to maintain the value of its goodwill; and the company’s cash flows. Additionally, potential legislative or judicial changes, including activities to invalidate, repeal or replace, in whole or in part, the Health Care Reform Law, creates uncertainty for Humana’s business, and when, or in what form, such legislative or judicial changes may occur cannot be predicted with certainty. 

•Humana’s business activities are subject to substantial government regulation. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application could increase the company’s cost of doing business and may adversely affect the company’s business, profitability and cash flows.

•Humana’s failure to manage acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

•If Humana fails to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to its members, the company’s business may be adversely affected. 

•Humana’s pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects it to regulations in addition to those the company faces with its core health benefits businesses. 

•Changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect Humana’s financial performance. 

•If Humana does not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels, Humana’s gross margins may decline. 

•Humana’s ability to obtain funds from certain of its licensed subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations. 

•Downgrades in Humana’s debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

•The securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption, which may adversely affect Humana’s business. 

In making forward-looking statements, Humana is not undertaking to address or update them in future filings or communications regarding its business or results. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed herein may or may not occur. There also may be other risks that the company is unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. 

Humana advises investors to read the following documents as filed by the company with the SEC for further discussion both of the risks it faces and its historical performance:

•Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018;

•Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019; June 30, 2019; September 30, 2019; and

•Form 8-Ks filed during 2019 and 2020.
