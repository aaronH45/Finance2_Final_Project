Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. 

On February 5, 2020, after the stock market closed, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued Part II of the 2021 Advance Notice of Methodological Changes for Medicare Advantage Capitation Rates and Part C and Part D Payment Policies (the “Advance Notice”). CMS has invited public comment on the Advance Notice before publishing final rates on April 6, 2020 (the “Final Notice”). 

In the Advance Notice, CMS estimates Medicare Advantage plans across the sector will, on average, experience a 0.93 percent increase in benchmark funding based on proposals included therein. As indicated by CMS, its estimate excludes the impact of fee for service county rebasing/repricing because the related impact is dependent upon finalization of certain data, which will be available with the publication of the Final Notice. 

Based on Humana Inc.’s (the “Company”) preliminary analysis using the same factors CMS included in its estimate, the components of which are detailed on CMS’ website, the Company anticipates that the proposals in the Advance Notice would result in a change to its benchmark funding relatively in line with CMS’ estimate. The Company will be drawing upon its program expertise to provide CMS formal commentary on the impact of the Advance Notice and the related impact upon Medicare beneficiaries’ quality of care and service to its members through the Medicare Advantage program.
