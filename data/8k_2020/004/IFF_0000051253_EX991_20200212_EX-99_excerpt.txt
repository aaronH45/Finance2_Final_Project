Management Commentary

“2019 was a transformational year for IFF as we continued to take important steps to redefine our industry, including our integration of Frutarom and recently announced combination with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences,” said IFF Chairman and CEO Andreas Fibig. “Importantly, we continued to achieve significant cost synergies from Frutarom well ahead of our year-one targets, and captured solid year one revenue synergies, demonstrating our broad operational strength.

“In the fourth quarter, we delivered high-single digit currency neutral top-line growth and a robust double-digit increase in adjusted EPS ex amortization - both broadly in line with our expectations. During 2019, we grew sales to $5.1 billion, expanded our adjusted operating profit margin ex amortization, and delivered on our balance sheet deleverage commitment - a testament to our team’s focus, dedication and commitment to delivering strong results while executing our long-term strategy.

“Looking forward to 2020, our priorities are clear: drive growth and profitability in our business, substantially complete the Frutarom integration and lay the groundwork for a successful combination with DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences. With continued focus on execution, we will be well-positioned to become a global leader in innovative integrated solutions and create value for all of our stakeholders."

Frutarom Business Unit 

•On a reported basis, sales were $1.5 billion. On a standalone basis, currency neutral sales increased 3%, including the net contribution of acquisitions and divested businesses. 

•Sales, excluding the impact of foreign currency and the benefits of acquisitions, remained constant driven by solid growth in Taste and Savory Solutions.

•Frutarom segment profit contributed $127 million, or $286 million excluding amortization. Margin continued to be supported by acquisition-related synergies and cost management.

Brazil Tax Recovery During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized $8 million in income related to the expected recoveries of previously paid indirect taxes in Brazil from the period from 2012 to 2018 that have been subject to litigation between the Company and certain tax authorities. The amount has been recorded in Selling and administrative expense. 

Compliance Investigation Completed

IFF’s investigation of allegations that improper payments to representatives of customers were made in Russia and Ukraine has been completed. Such allegations were substantiated, and IFF has confirmed that key members of Frutarom’s senior management at the time were aware of such payments. IFF has taken appropriate remedial actions, including replacing senior management in relevant locations, and believes that such improper customer payments have stopped.

IFF has confirmed in these investigations that total affected sales represented less than 1% of IFF’s consolidated net sales for 2019. The impact of the reviews including the costs associated with them, have not been material to IFF’s results of operations or financial condition. In addition, no evidence 

was uncovered suggesting that any of these compliance matters had any connection to the United States.

In addition to IFF’s standard compliance integration activities, IFF also conducted a robust secondary review of Frutarom’s operations in certain other jurisdictions, including those that it deems “high risk”. These reviews supplemented IFF’s existing global compliance initiatives that were implemented at Frutarom in connection with the closing of the Frutarom transaction. These secondary reviews were conducted with the assistance of outside legal and accounting firms. These reviews are also complete.

IFF is committed to the highest standards of ethics and integrity and has strict compliance policies in place that are regularly reviewed and updated.

Outlook

The Company's 2020 guidance is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

When comparing 2020 guidance to 2019 results, currency is expected to negatively impact sales by an estimated 1 percentage point, and adjusted EPS ex amortization by 3 percentage points.

Sales growth for 2020 is expected to be approximately 1% to 5% on a currency neutral basis, which includes an estimated 1 percentage point impact related to the 53rd week in the prior year period and an anticipated 0.5 percentage point impact, principally related to the carryover effect from the Russia/Ukraine compliance issue and CitraSource. Excluding these impacts, currency neutral core sales growth is expected to be approximately 2.5% to 6.5%. 

Adjusted EPS ex amortization growth for 2020 is expected to be approximately 3.5% to 7.5% on a currency neutral basis, which includes an estimated 5 percentage point impact related to an incentive compensation reset, an estimated 1 percentage point impact related to the 53rd week in the prior year period and an anticipated 0.5 percentage point impact, principally related to the carryover effect from the Russia/Ukraine compliance issue and CitraSource. Offsetting this is a 6 percentage point contribution from integration synergies. Excluding these impacts, core currency neutral adjusted EPS ex amortization growth is expected to be approximately 4% to 8%.

The Company expects to achieve a Net Debt to EBITDA ratio of less than 3.0x by the end of 2020.

The Company expects a modest impact from the recent coronavirus outbreak in Asia, based on its knowledge at this time. However, there are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding this outbreak to quantify currently. The Company is assessing developments constantly and will update these measures as needed.

Starting in the first quarter 2020, the Company will report financial results in two segments, Taste and Scent, incorporating nearly all Frutarom business into the Taste segment. Under the new reporting structure, the new Taste segment would have represented approximately 62% of 2019 sales and the new Scent segment would have represented approximately 38% of 2019 sales.

A copy of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K will be available on its website at www.iff.com or at www.sec.gov by March 3, 2020. 

Audio Webcast

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We provide in this press release non-GAAP financial measures, including: (i) currency neutral sales; (ii) adjusted operating profit; (iii) adjusted operating profit (margin) ex. amortization; (iv) adjusted EPS; (v) adjusted EPS ex. amortization; (vi) Frutarom organic sales and (vii) Frutarom segment profit ex amortization

Our non-GAAP financial measures are defined below. 

Currency Neutral metrics eliminate the effects that result from translating international currency to U.S. dollars. We calculate currency neutral numbers by comparing current year results to the prior year results restated at exchange rates in effect for the current year based on the currency of the underlying transaction. 

Frutarom organic sales are currency neutral sales excluding the impact of acquisitions for the twelve months following the acquisition. We also adjust Frutarom organic sales on a currency neutral basis to reflect planned divestitures and temporary business headwinds related to CitraSouce, Natural Colors, PTI and Trade & Marketing that are expected to normalize.

Adjusted Operating Profit excludes the impact of operational improvement initiatives, acquisition related costs, integration related costs, restructuring and other charges, net, losses (gains) on sale of assets, FDA mandated product recall, Frutarom acquisition related costs, compliance review & legal defense costs and N&B transaction related costs ("Operating Profit Items Impacting Comparability").

Adjusted Operating Profit (Margin) ex. Amortization excludes the impact of Operating Profit Items Impacting Comparability and the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets.

Adjusted EPS excludes the impact of operational improvement initiatives, acquisition related costs, integration related costs, restructuring and other charges, net, losses (gains) on sale of assets, FDA mandated product recall, U.S. tax reform, Frutarom acquisition related costs, compliance review & legal defense costs, N&B merger related costs and redemption value adjustment to EPS (often referred to as “Items Impacting Comparability”).

Adjusted EPS ex. Amortization excludes the impact of Items Impacting Comparability and the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets.

Frutarom segment profit ex amortization is Frutarom segment profit excluding amortization expense related to intangible assets of $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $159 million in the full year 2019.

These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. Such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. In discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period-to-period comparable basis, financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Company’s results under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ calculation of such metrics.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we began including Adjusted EPS ex. Amortization as a key non-GAAP financial measure of our business. Full amortization expense of intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions will be excluded from Adjusted EPS ex. Amortization calculation. The exclusion of amortization expense allows comparison of operating results that are consistent over time for newly and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe this calculation will provide a more accurate presentation in this and in future periods in the event of additional acquisitions. Further, this allows the investors to evaluate and understand operating trends excluding the impact on operating income and earnings per diluted share. In addition, the Frutarom acquisition related costs have been separated from costs related to prior acquisitions. The Frutarom acquisition costs represent a significant balance and we believe this amount should be shown separately to provide an accurate presentation of the acquisition related costs. Our GAAP results and GAAP metrics do not change, and this change has no effect on day to day business operations, or how we manage our business. For Frutarom, we present segment profit excluding amortization expense as it allows comparison of operating results that are consistent over 

time for newly and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Metrics. This press release also includes our expectations for 2020 with respect to (i) sales growth; (ii) Adjusted EPS growth; and (iii) Adjusted EPS ex. amortization growth. The closest corresponding GAAP measures to these non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP metric expectation and the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort due to the length of the forecasted period and potential variability, complexity and low visibility as to items such as future contingencies and other costs that would be excluded from the GAAP measures, and the tax impact of such items, in the relevant future period. The variability of the excluded items may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP results. 

Combined 2018 Financials

We calculated “combined” numbers by combining (i) our fiscal year 2018 results (including Frutarom from October 4, 2018 to December 31, 2018) with (ii) the results of Frutarom from January 1, 2018 to October 3, 2018, and adjusting for divestitures of Frutarom’s businesses since October 4, 2018, but do not include any other adjustments that would have been made had we owned Frutarom for such periods prior to October 4, 2018.

Standalone Frutarom Growth

We calculated Frutarom growth “on a standalone basis” by comparing (i) Frutarom sales results prior to acquisition from January 1, 2018 to October 3, 2018 combined with Frutarom sales post acquisition from October 4, 2018 to December 31, 2018 to (ii) Frutarom sales results for fiscal year 2019.
