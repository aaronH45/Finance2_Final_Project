The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated as of October 31, 2014 (the “Base Indenture”) as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of May 8, 2017 (the “Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”), between State Street and U.S. Bank National Association, a national banking association organized under the laws of the United States, as trustee. The form of Note is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto. The Base Indenture has been included as Exhibit 4.2 to State Street’s Registration Statement on Form S-3, filed with the SEC on November 18, 2014.
