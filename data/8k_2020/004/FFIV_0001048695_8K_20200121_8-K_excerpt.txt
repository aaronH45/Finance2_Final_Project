Item 5.03Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year

On January 21, 2020, the Board of Directors of F5 Networks, Inc. (the “Company”) amended the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Amended Bylaws”) to implement proxy access. 

Section 2.12 of the Amended Bylaws has been added to permit a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years, to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials directors constituting up to the greater of two directors and 20% of the Board of Directors, provided that the requirements specified in the Amended Bylaws are satisfied. 

The Company engaged in discussions with certain shareholders regarding providing proxy access, to allow the Board to implement terms that it believes will provide meaningful proxy access rights for its shareholders while furthering the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders.

The amendments also include updating changes in the Amended Bylaws regarding advance notice of nominations or business to be presented at an annual meeting of shareholders, to coordinate with the proxy access provisions, including regarding certain informational requirements, and make other ministerial, clarifying, and conforming changes. 

The amendments to the Bylaws are effective as of January 21, 2020. Proxy access will first apply with respect to the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held in 2021. 

This description of the amendments included in the Amended Bylaws is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Amended Bylaws, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Form 8-K.
