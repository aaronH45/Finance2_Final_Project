Item 5.04. Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant’s Employee Benefit Plans. 

On February 4, 2020, Dominion Energy, Inc. (the "Company") sent a blackout trading restriction notice to its executive officers and directors (the "BTR Notice") informing them that they would be prohibited from engaging in certain transactions involving the Company’s common stock, during a blackout period (the "Blackout Period") under the Dominion Energy Salaried Savings Plan, the Dominion Energy Hourly Savings Plan, the Dominion Energy Ohio Union Savings Plan, and the Dominion Energy Transmission & West Virginia Union Savings Plan (collectively, the "Plans"). The BTR Notice indicated that the Blackout Period will begin at 4:00 PM Eastern Time on March 24, 2020 and is expected to end no later than the week of April 6, 2020. A copy of the BTR Notice is attached as Exhibit 99 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.  

The reason for the Blackout Period is to facilitate the Plans’ transition to a new third-party administrator. During the Blackout Period, participants in the Plans will be unable to borrow or take distributions from their Plan accounts, or direct or diversify their Plan investments, including with respect to Dominion Energy common stock.  

The Company was deemed to have been furnished notice of the Blackout Period on January 31, 2020, the same date as notice was furnished to affected participants and beneficiaries in the Plans. At any time during the week of April 6, 2020, and for a period of two years from the end of the Blackout Period, interested persons may contact the person identified below to determine the actual ending date of the Blackout Period. 

Inquiries relating to the Blackout Period may be directed to Karen W. Doggett, Assistant Corporate Secretary, at Dominion Energy, Inc., 120 Tredegar Street, Richmond, VA 23219, or by telephone at (804) 819-2123.
