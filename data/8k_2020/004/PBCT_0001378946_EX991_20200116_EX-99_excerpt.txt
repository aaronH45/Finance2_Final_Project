 •    

Completed the acquisition of United Financial on November 1st.  

 •    

Return on average assets of 0.98 percent, or 1.13 percent on an operating basis, and return on average tangible common equity of 12.8 percent, or 15.2 percent on an operating basis.  

 •    

Net interest margin of 3.14 percent, expanded two basis points linked-quarter and benefited from a 13 basis point reduction in deposit costs.  

 •    

Efficiency ratio of 53.7 percent, improved 310 basis points linked-quarter, reflecting well-controlled expenses and higher revenues, particularly continued strong non-interest income results.  

 •    

Period-end loans increased 12 percent linked-quarter driven by the United Financial acquisition and solid commercial organic growth, partially offset by a planned reduction of residential mortgage balances.

“We are very pleased with the Company’s financial and operating performance in 2019,” said Jack Barnes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “It was another noteworthy year for People’s United as we acquired two banks and a specialty finance company, enhanced our suite of banking technology and further strengthened core capabilities. As a result, we continued to build the earnings power of the Company as evidenced by a 20 percent increase in full year operating earnings from a year ago and an operating return on average tangible common equity of 14.7 percent. In addition, operating earnings per common share of $1.39 increased for the tenth consecutive year. While we have almost tripled total assets to nearly $60 billion over the last ten years, we have   

 remained true to our roots of delivering superior service at a local level, maintaining exceptional asset quality and supporting our communities. As we start a new decade already filled with economic and competitive uncertainties, we are confident our long-term approach to managing the business will enable us to generate value for customers and shareholders regardless of the operating environment. ”  

“We concluded 2019 with a strong financial performance as demonstrated by another record quarter of earnings,” stated David Rosato, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “Operating earnings of $158.8 million increased 17 percent linked-quarter and reflected the acquisition of United, improved net interest margin and positive operating leverage. The fourth quarter margin of 3.14 percent benefited from continued remixing of the loan portfolio, disciplined management of deposit costs and the net effect of purchase accounting adjustments related to the United transaction. Excluding these purchase accounting adjustments, the margin was 3.09 percent. On an organic basis, period-end loan balances were essentially flat compared to September 30th, while period-end deposits declined one percent. Commercial loan growth of $314 million was driven by solid results in commercial real estate, equipment finance and our specialized industry verticals within C&I. These increases were offset by a $343 million decline in retail loans mostly due to our planned reduction of residential mortgages as we continue to remix the balance sheet with a focus on higher yielding portfolios. The decline in period-end deposits of $287 million was primarily attributable to lower brokered deposit balances.”

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND RECONCILIATION TO GAAP  

In addition to evaluating People’s United Financial Inc. (“People’s United”) results of operations in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible common equity ratios, tangible book value per common share and operating earnings metrics. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding People’s United’s underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. Further, the efficiency ratio and operating earnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control, while the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are used to analyze the relative strength of People’s United’s capital position.  

The efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People’s United to generate a dollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding operating lease expense, goodwill impairment charges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangible assets, losses on real estate assets and non-recurring expenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis plus total non-interest income (including the FTE adjustment on bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) income, the netting of operating lease expense and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans and acquired loans, and non-recurring income) (the denominator). People’s United generally considers an item of income or expense to be non-recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.  

Operating earnings exclude from net income available to common shareholders those items that management considers to be of such a non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), People’s United’s results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating earnings, which include, but are not limited to: (i) non-recurring gains/losses; (ii) merger-related expenses, including acquisition integration and other costs; (iii) writedowns of banking house assets and related lease termination costs; (iv) severance-related costs; and (v) charges related to executive-level management separation costs, are generally also excluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Operating earnings per common share (“EPS”) is derived by determining the per common share impact of the respective adjustments to arrive at operating earnings and adding (subtracting) such amounts to (from) diluted EPS, as reported. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average total assets. Operating return on average tangible common equity is calculated by dividing operating earnings (annualized) by average tangible common equity. The operating common dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing common dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.  

The tangible common equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible common equity (total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock, goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the denominator). Tangible book value per common share is calculated by dividing tangible common equity by common shares (total common shares issued, less common shares classified as treasury shares and unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) common shares).  

In light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions, the methodologies used by People’s United for determining the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions.
