NET INTEREST INCOME

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(*) Interest income, net interest income and net interest margin presented on an FTE basis are non-generally accepted accounting principle financial measures that facilitate the analysis of asset yields. Please refer to the Reconciliation to Fully Taxable Equivalent section for further detail.

Q4 2019 vs. Q3 2019

▪Net interest income on an FTE basis increased primarily due to an increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a lower net interest margin. 

▪The net interest margin on an FTE basis decreased primarily due to lower short-term interest rates.

▪Average earning assets increased primarily due to higher levels of securities and higher short-term interest-bearing deposits with banks.

Q4 2019 vs. Q4 2018

▪Net interest income on an FTE basis was essentially flat.

▪The net interest margin on an FTE basis increased primarily due to a balance sheet mix shift and the impact of lower foreign exchange swap volume, partially offset by lower short-term interest rates.

Funding of the balance sheet reflected lower interest-bearing deposits, client demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits, and short-term borrowed funds, partially offset by increased other liabilities.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(*) N/M - Not meaningful

Q4 2019

▪The credit provision in the current quarter was primarily driven by an overall decrease in the inherent allowance related to changes in credit quality, partially offset by net charge-offs. 

Q3 2019

▪The credit provision in the prior quarter was primarily driven by a decrease in the specific allowance attributable to the residential real estate portfolio and a slight decrease in the inherent allowance.

This was partially offset by increases in specific reserves related to outstanding loans and standby letters of credit in the residential real estate and commercial and institutional portfolios, respectively.

FOURTH QUARTER 2019 RESULTS (continued)

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Q4 2019 vs. Q3 2019 

▪Compensation expense increased due to higher salary expense driven by staff growth, as well as unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by lower cash-based incentive accruals.

▪Outside services expense increased due to higher legal and consulting services as well as costs related to increased business volumes. 

▪Equipment and software expense increased primarily driven by higher software disposition charges and increased software support costs.

Q4 2019 vs. Q4 2018

FOURTH QUARTER 2019 RESULTS (continued)

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Q4 2019 vs. Q3 2019

▪The provision for income taxes decreased primarily due to a change in the earnings mix in tax jurisdictions in which the Corporation operates and one-time benefits related to previously granted performance stock unit (PSU) awards and additional research and development tax credits. These decreases to the provision for income taxes were partially offset by higher U.S. taxes payable on the income of the Corporation’s non-U.S. branches. 

Q4 2019 vs. Q4 2018

▪The provision for income taxes increased primarily due to income tax benefits recorded in 2018 associated with the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. Also contributing to the increase in the provision for income taxes in the current quarter are higher U.S. taxes payable on the income of the Corporation’s non-U.S. branches. These increases to the provision for income taxes were partially offset by a change in the earnings mix in tax jurisdictions in which the Corporation operates and one-time benefits related to previously granted PSU awards and additional research and development tax credits.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Average total stockholders’ equity increased $633.8 million, or 6%, to $10.9 billion from the prior-year quarter’s average of $10.3 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to earnings, the issuance of preferred stock and accumulated other comprehensive income since the prior-year period, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the Corporation’s share repurchase program and dividend declarations. 

During the current quarter, the Corporation issued and sold 16,000,000 depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000th ownership interest in a share of Series E Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock for proceeds of $391.4 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions, and other issuance costs. These proceeds were subsequently used to fund the redemption of all outstanding shares of the Corporation’s Series C Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock on January 2, 2020.

During the current quarter, the Corporation declared cash dividends totaling $5.8 million to preferred stockholders and cash dividends totaling $149.8 million to common stockholders.

RECONCILIATION TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT

The following table presents a reconciliation of interest income, net interest income, net interest margin, and total revenue prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to such measures on an FTE basis, which are non-generally accepted accounting financial measures. Management believes this presentation provides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.
