Outlook 

The Company said that based on its assessment of market conditions today, management anticipates local currency sales growth in 2020 will be approximately 4%. This sales growth is expected to result in Adjusted EPS in the range of $24.85 to $25.10, a growth rate of 9% to 10%. Management noted that local currency sales growth and Adjusted EPS guidance remains unchanged from previous guidance. 

Management noted that they will face tough comparisons in the first quarter 2020 due to strong sales in the prior-year quarter and will face strong headwinds to Adjusted EPS due to adverse currency and the impact of tariff costs in the first quarter. In addition, based on today's assessment, the Company expects a significant impact on its China sales in the first quarter due to the Wuhan Coronavirus.

Based on market conditions today, the Company anticipates that local currency sales growth in the first quarter 2020 will be approximately 0% to 1%, and Adjusted EPS is forecasted to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.30, an increase of 2% to 5%. 

While the Company has provided an outlook for local currency sales growth and Adjusted EPS, it has not provided an outlook for reported sales growth or EPS as it would require an estimate of currency exchange fluctuations and non-recurring items, which are not yet known. The Company noted in making its outlook that uncertainty remains in the macroeconomic environment and market conditions are subject to change. 

Conclusion

Filliol concluded, "Demand in our markets remains solid with the exception of Food Retail and the potential short-term impact of the Wuhan Coronavirus. We continue to invest for growth via our investments in our field force, Spinnaker sales and marketing programs and new product development. We remain confident in executing on our growth, productivity and margin initiatives. We will monitor the macroeconomic environment as uncertainty exists in certain regions of the world, and remain agile and adapt if market conditions change. Based on market conditions today, we believe we can continue to gain share and deliver strong results in 2020."
