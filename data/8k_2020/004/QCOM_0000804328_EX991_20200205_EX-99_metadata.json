        "(b)At fiscal year end, the quarterly tax provision for each column equals the annual tax provision for each column computed in accordance with GAAP. In interim quarters, the sum of these provisions may not equal the total GAAP tax provision, and this difference is included in the tax provision in the “Other Items” column. The tax benefit in the “Other Items” column included a $44 million tax benefit for release of a valuation allowance, a $43 million foreign currency gain related to a noncurrent receivable related to our refund claim of Korean withholding taxes paid in prior periods, a $12 million tax benefit for the tax effect of acquisition-related charges and a $2 million tax benefit from the combined effect of other items in EBT, partially offset by a $13 million charge related to a change in prior period tax rate of a foreign jurisdiction."
