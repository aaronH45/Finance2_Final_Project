Transformative Transaction with Sycamore Partners

As previously announced on February 20, 2020, L Brands and Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm specializing in consumer and retail investments, entered into a definitive agreement that is intended to deliver long-term value to L Brands shareholders by positioning Bath & Body Works as a highly profitable, standalone public company and separating Victoria’s Secret Lingerie, Victoria’s Secret Beauty and PINK (collectively, Victoria’s Secret) into a privately-held entity focused on reinvigorating its market-leading businesses and returning them to historic levels of profitability and growth. Under the terms of the transaction, and after taking into account certain liabilities, Sycamore will purchase a 55% interest in Victoria’s Secret for approximately $525 million. L Brands will retain a 45% stake in Victoria’s Secret to enable its shareholders to meaningfully participate in the upside potential of these businesses. The transaction is the result of a comprehensive review of a broad range of options undertaken by the board of directors, with input from outside financial advisors, designed to best position the company’s brands for long-term success and drive shareholder value. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter 2020.

First Quarter 2020 Outlook

The company currently expects a 2020 first quarter adjusted loss per share of about $0.05. The company will not provide guidance for the full year at this time due to the pending transaction with Sycamore Partners, but the company’s guidance for the first quarter 2020 includes the Victoria’s Secret business.

The Adjusted Financial Information should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Further, the Company’s definition of adjusted income information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Management believes that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. While it is not possible to predict future results, management believes the adjusted information is useful for the assessment of the ongoing operations of the Company because the adjusted items are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and nature. Additionally, management uses adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. The Adjusted Financial Information should be read in conjunction with the Company’s historical financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K.
