SAN FRANCISCO – January 14, 2020 – Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) reported net income of $2.9 billion, or $0.60 per diluted common share, for fourth quarter 2019, compared with $6.1 billion, or $1.21 per share, for fourth quarter 2018, and $4.6 billion, or $0.92 per share, for third quarter 2019. 

Chief Executive Officer and President Charlie Scharf said, “Wells Fargo is a wonderful and important franchise that has made some serious mistakes, and my mandate is to make the fundamental changes necessary to regain the full trust and respect of all stakeholders.” 

“During my first three months at Wells Fargo my primary focus has been on advancing our required regulatory work with a different sense of urgency and resolve, while beginning to develop a path to improve our financial results. This work is necessary to build the appropriate foundation for us to move forward. Wells Fargo plays an important role for our country, and we know that ultimately our actions and results will dictate when that trust is fully regained. And while the work is substantial, I am confident that with the appropriate prioritization of resources, processes, and management attention, we can accomplish what is expected of us," Mr. Scharf added. 

"In addition, even in my short time at the company, it is clear that our opportunities to improve our performance are substantial when we finish this work. Our cost structure is too high, and I believe there are many areas where we will be able to increase our rate of growth. While it is too early to put time frames around these goals, we will be diligent in pursuing them and I am confident the opportunities are meaningful,” Mr. Scharf concluded.

Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said, “Wells Fargo reported $2.9 billion of net income in the fourth quarter and diluted earnings per share of $0.60, which included the impact of $1.5 billion, or $(0.33) per share, of litigation accruals for a variety of matters, including previously disclosed retail sales practices matters. Our net interest income declined in the fourth quarter driven predominantly by the impact of the lower interest rate environment. In addition, while we are spending what is necessary in order to improve risk management, our other expenses were too

high and becoming more efficient remains a top priority. However, we continued to have positive business trends with both loans and deposits growing from the third quarter and a year ago. We also saw increases from the third quarter and a year ago in primary consumer checking customers, debit and credit card usage, Wealth and Investment Management total client assets, and Investment Banking market share. Our net charge-off rate remained near historic lows, and our capital levels were strong even as we returned $9 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the fourth quarter, reducing common shares outstanding by 10% compared with a year ago.”

Net Interest Income

Net interest income in the fourth quarter was $11.2 billion, down $425 million from third quarter 2019, predominantly due to balance sheet repricing driven by the impact of the lower interest rate environment, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, and higher mortgage-backed securities (MBS) premium amortization, partially offset by the benefit of balance sheet growth. 

The net interest margin was 2.53%, down 13 basis points from the prior quarter predominantly due to balance sheet repricing driven by the impact of the lower interest rate environment, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, and higher MBS premium amortization. 

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income in the fourth quarter was $8.7 billion, down $1.7 billion from third quarter 2019. Fourth quarter noninterest income included lower other income, market sensitive revenue4, and other fees, partially offset by higher mortgage banking income and service charges on deposit accounts.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

4 Market sensitive revenue represents net gains from trading activities, debt securities, and equity securities.

5 Production margin represents net gains on residential mortgage loan origination/sales activities divided by total residential held-for-sale mortgage originations. See the “Selected Five Quarter Residential Mortgage Production Data” table on page 42 for more information.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense in the fourth quarter was $15.6 billion, up $415 million from the prior quarter. Fourth quarter noninterest expense included higher employee benefits expense driven by $263 million of deferred compensation expense (largely offset by net gains from equity securities) and higher equipment expense driven by higher capitalized software impairment expense, and higher computer software licensing and maintenance costs. Additionally, operating losses of $1.9 billion in fourth quarter 2019 were flat compared with third quarter 2019, and included $1.5 billion of litigation accruals in the fourth quarter for a variety of matters, including previously disclosed retail sales practices matters.

Income Taxes

The Company’s effective income tax rate was 19.1% for fourth quarter 2019 and included net discrete income tax expense of $303 million predominantly related to the non-tax deductible treatment of certain litigation accruals. The effective income tax rate in third quarter 2019 was 22.1% and included net discrete income tax expense of $443 million predominantly related to the non-tax deductible treatment of a litigation accrual. The Company's full year 2019 effective income tax rate was 17.5% (15.7% before discrete items).

Loans

Average loans were $956.5 billion in the fourth quarter, up $6.8 billion from the third quarter. Period-end loan balances were $962.3 billion at December 31, 2019, up $7.4 billion from September 30, 2019. Commercial loans were up $3.4 billion compared with September 30, 2019, predominantly due to $3.3 billion of growth in commercial and industrial loans. Consumer loans increased $4.0 billion from the prior quarter, reflecting the following:

•Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans increased $3.2 billion, as $17.8 billion of held-for-investment mortgage loan originations and the purchase of $2.3 billion of loans as a result of exercising servicer cleanup calls were partially offset by paydowns

•Real estate 1-4 family junior lien mortgage loans decreased $1.3 billion, as paydowns continued to exceed originations

•Credit card loans increased $1.4 billion, primarily due to seasonality

•Automobile loans increased $1.1 billion, driven by $6.8 billion of originations

Debt and Equity Securities 

Debt securities include available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities, as well as debt securities held for trading. Period-end debt securities were $497.1 billion at December 31, 2019, down $6.4 billion from the third quarter driven by a $7.0 billion decrease in debt securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, as purchases of approximately $15.6 billion, primarily federal agency MBS in the available-for-sale portfolio, were more than offset by runoff and sales. 

Net unrealized gains on available-for-sale debt securities were $3.4 billion at December 31, 2019, compared with $3.1 billion at September 30, 2019, primarily due to tighter credit spreads, partially offset by higher long-term interest rates in the fourth quarter.

Equity securities include marketable and non-marketable equity securities, as well as equity securities held for trading. Period-end equity securities were $68.2 billion at December 31, 2019, up $4.4 billion from the third quarter.

Deposits

Total average deposits for fourth quarter 2019 were $1.3 trillion, up $30.5 billion from the prior quarter driven by growth in both commercial and consumer deposits. The average deposit cost for fourth quarter 2019 was 62 basis points, down 9 basis points from the prior quarter and up 7 basis points from a year ago.

Capital

The Company's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.1%2 and continued to exceed both the regulatory minimum of 9% and our current internal target of 10%. In fourth quarter 2019, the Company repurchased 141.1 million shares of its common stock, which, net of issuances, reduced period-end common shares outstanding by 134.7 million. The Company paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.51 per share. 

As of December 31, 2019, our eligible external total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 23.2%6, compared with the required minimum of 22.0%.

Net Loan Charge-offs

The quarterly loss rate in the fourth quarter was 0.32% (annualized), up from 0.27% in the prior quarter and 0.30% a year ago. Commercial and consumer losses were 0.16% and 0.51%, respectively. Total credit losses were $769 million in fourth quarter 2019, up $124 million from third quarter 2019. Commercial losses increased $64 million largely driven by lower recoveries and higher lease financing losses primarily related to railcar leases. Consumer losses increased $60 million primarily due to seasonality in the credit card, automobile, and other revolving credit and installment portfolios.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses, including the allowance for unfunded commitments, totaled $10.5 billion at December 31, 2019, down $157 million from September 30, 2019, and included a $125 million reserve release1 in fourth quarter 2019, primarily due to improved credit performance in the consumer loan portfolio and a higher probability of slightly more favorable economic conditions. The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.09%, compared with 1.11% in third quarter 2019. The allowance covered 3.4 times annualized fourth quarter net charge-offs, compared with 4.1 times in the prior quarter. The allowance coverage for nonaccrual loans was 196% at December 31, 2019, compared with 191% at September 30, 2019.

Forward-Looking Statements 

This document contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, we may make forward-looking statements in our other documents filed or furnished with the SEC, and our management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the Company, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality and performance, including our expectations regarding future loan losses and allowance levels; (iv) the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses; (v) our expectations regarding net interest income and net interest margin; (vi) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in our loan portfolios; (vii) future capital or liquidity levels or targets and our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III capital standards; (viii) the performance of our mortgage business and any related exposures; (ix) the expected outcome and impact of legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our expectations regarding compliance therewith; (x) future common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other uses of capital; (xi) our targeted range for return on assets, return on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (xii) the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings; and (xiii) the Company’s plans, objectives and strategies.

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation: 

•current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of declines in housing prices, high unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters, geopolitical matters, and any slowdown in global economic growth;

•our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;

•financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation and regulation relating to bank products and services;

•developments in our mortgage banking business, including the extent of the success of our mortgage loan modification efforts, the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands that we receive, any negative effects relating to our mortgage servicing, loan modification or foreclosure practices, and the effects of regulatory or judicial requirements or guidance impacting our mortgage banking business and any changes in industry standards;

•our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as part of our expense management initiatives, including as a result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, litigation and regulatory matters;

•the effect of the current interest rate environment or changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgage loans held for sale;

•significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or financial markets, which could result in, among other things, reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and declines in asset values and/or recognition of other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our debt securities and equity securities portfolios;

•the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment banking business and our fee income from our brokerage, asset and wealth management businesses;

- 14 -

•negative effects from the retail banking sales practices matter and from other instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, including on our legal, operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our ability to attract and retain qualified team members, and our reputation;

•resolution of regulatory matters, litigation, or other legal actions, which may result in, among other things, additional costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences;

•a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks;

•the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin;

•fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; and

•the other risk factors and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations (including federal securities laws and federal banking regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the Company’s Board of Directors, and may be subject to regulatory approval or conditions.

For more information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on its website at www.sec.gov.

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures. From time to time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future results.

TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY 

We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on nonmarketable equity securities, net of applicable deferred taxes. These tangible common equity ratios are as follows:

•Tangible book value per common share, which represents tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding; and

•Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), which represents our annualized earnings contribution as a percentage of tangible common equity.

The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that tangible book value per common share and return on average tangible common equity, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable investors and others to assess the Company’s use of equity.

The tables below provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 UNDER BASEL III (1)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Basel III capital rules, adopted by the Federal Reserve Board on July 2, 2013, revised the definition of capital, increased minimum capital ratios, and introduced a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio. The rules are being phased in through the end of 2021. Fully phased-in capital amounts, ratios and RWAs are calculated assuming the full phase-in of the Basel III capital rules. The Basel III capital requirements for calculating CET1 and tier 1 capital, along with RWAs, are fully phased-in. 

(2)Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period end.

(3)The final Basel III capital rules provide for two capital frameworks: the Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions. Accordingly, in the assessment of our capital adequacy, we must report the lower of our CET1, tier 1 and total capital ratios calculated under the Standardized Approach and under the Advanced Approach. Because the final determination of our CET1 ratio and which approach will produce the lower CET1 ratio as of December 31, 2019, is subject to detailed analysis of considerable data, our CET1 ratio at that date has been estimated using the Basel III definition of capital under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs. The capital ratio for September 30, June 30 and March 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, was calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach RWAs.

(4)The Company’s December 31, 2019, RWAs and capital ratio are preliminary estimates.
