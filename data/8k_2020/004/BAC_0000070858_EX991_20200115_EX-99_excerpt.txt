 Commentary from Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio: “The company managed well through a period of transition from rising rates to lower rates over a short period of time. Solid client activity in growing loans and gathering deposits helped us offset spread compression. We also are aided by diverse lines of business and operations, with noninterest income comprising nearly half of our revenue.” Consumer Banking Three months ended Financial Results1 ($ in millions) 12/31/2019 9/30/2019 12/31/2018 Total revenue2 $9,514 $9,724 $9,962 Provision for credit losses 934 917 915 • Net income of $3.1 billion, down $332 million, or 10%, as healthy levels of client activity and spending Noninterest expense 4,466 4,391 4,435 helped mitigate the impact of lower rates Pretax income 4,114 4,416 4,612 • Revenue of $9.5 billion decreased 4%, driven Income tax expense 1,008 1,082 1,174 primarily by lower NII and the absence of a small gain Net income $3,106 $3,334 $3,438 in 4Q18 1 Comparisons are to the year-ago quarter unless noted. 2 • Provision for credit losses increased modestly to Revenue, net of interest expense. $934 million – Net charge-off ratio improved to 1.18%, compared to 1.22% • Noninterest expense increased 1%, driven by the cost of increased client activity and investments for business growth, largely offset by improved productivity and lower FDIC expense Three months ended Business Highlights1,2 ($ in billions) 12/31/2019 9/30/2019 12/31/2018 • Average deposits grew $33 billion, or 5%; average Average deposits $719.6 $709.3 $686.8 loans grew $21 billion, or 7%, driven by growth in Average loans and leases 311.0 303.8 289.9 residential mortgages Consumer investment assets 240.1 223.2 185.9 • Consumer investment assets grew $54 billion, or (EOP) 29%, to $240 billion, driven by strong market Active mobile banking users 29.2 28.7 26.4 performance and client flows (MM) • Combined credit/debit card spend increased 6%, with Number of financial centers 4,300 4,302 4,341 record 2019 holiday spend Efficiency ratio 47% 45% 45% • 40 new financial centers opened and 305 renovated Return on average allocated 33 36 37 in 4Q19 capital • Digital usage continued to grow Total Consumer Credit Card2 – 38.3 million active digital banking users, up 6% Average credit card $95.0 $94.4 $95.8 – 29.2 million active mobile banking users, up 10% outstanding balances – Digital sales were 29% of all Consumer Banking Total credit/debit spend 167.2 162.0 158.1 sales Risk-adjusted margin 8.7% 8.5% 8.7% – 1.6 billion mobile logins in 4Q19 1 Comparisons are to the year-ago quarter unless noted. 2 – 9.7 million active Zelle® users with 95 million The consumer credit card portfolio includes Consumer Banking and GWIM. transactions in 4Q19 • 6.1 million Consumer customers enrolled in Preferred Rewards with 99% retention rate 2

Endnotes A We also measure net interest income on an FTE basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. FTE basis is a performance measure used in operating the business that management believes provides investors a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. We believe that this presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $12.3 billion, $12.3 billion and $12.7 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2019, September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The FTE adjustment was $145 million, $148 million and $155 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019, September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. B Global Markets revenue and net income, excluding net debit valuation adjustments (DVA), and sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, are non- GAAP financial measures. Net DVA gains (losses) were $(86) million, $(15) million and $52 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019, September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. FICC net DVA gains (losses) were $(81) million, $(18) million and $45 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019, September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Equities net DVA gains (losses) were $(5) million, $3 million and $7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019, September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. C Our financial results, after giving effect to the impact of the non-cash impairment charge related to the notice of termination of the merchant services joint venture (JV) at the conclusion of its current term, include non-GAAP financial measures. This impairment charge was recorded in 3Q19 and reduced net income by $1.7 billion, or $0.19 per diluted share ($0.18 per diluted share for full-year 2019), which included an increase in noninterest expense and a reduction in pretax income of $2.1 billion and a reduction in income tax expense of $373 million. The impairment charge negatively impacted 2019 return on average assets by 7 bps, return on average common shareholders’ equity by 66 bps, return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity by 91 bps and increased the efficiency ratio by 227 bps. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in understanding our results of operations and comparing our operational performance between periods. D Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. See page 18 of this press release for reconciliation to GAAP financial measures. E Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, limited to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS, and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities, and are readily available to meet funding requirements as they arise. They do not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity among legal entities may be subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions. F Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2019 are preliminary. The Corporation reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, which for Common equity tier 1 (CET1) is the Standardized approach for all reporting dates presented. 10

We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 18. (2) Ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. Charge-off ratios are annualized for the quarterly presentation. (3) Balances do not include past due consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and individually insured long-term stand-by agreements (fully insured home loans), and in general, other consumer and commercial loans not secured by real estate; purchased credit-impaired loans even though the customer may be contractually past due; and nonperforming loans held for sale or accounted for under the fair value option. (4) Regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2019 are preliminary. Bank of America Corporation reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, which for Common equity tier 1 (CET1) is the Standardized approach for all periods presented. (5) Tangible equity ratio equals period-end tangible shareholders’ equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible common equity ratio equals period-end tangible common shareholders’ equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible shareholders’ equity and tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income.

 18 Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures (Dollars in millions, except per share information) The Corporation evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation’s use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. See the tables below for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely related financial measures defined by GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the three months ended December 31, 2019, September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in understanding its results of operations and trends. Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently.
