Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On January 30, 2020, AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the “Company”) issued a news release announcing the Company’s earnings for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019. A copy of the news release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

The information in this item and in the exhibit attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 is being furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. This information shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.

On January 30, 2020, the Company announced its plan to exit the PharMEDium compounding business and as a result, the Company will cease all commercial and administrative operations related to this business. The decision to exit the PharMEDium business, which was approved by the Company's Board of Directors on January 23, 2020, was due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, ongoing operational, regulatory, and commercial challenges, such as PharMEDium's decision in January 2020 to suspend production at the compounding facility in New Jersey pending facility upgrades related to the air handling and filtration systems. In addition to the PharMEDium impairment charge of $138.0 million recognized in the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company expects it will impair the majority of the remaining $55 million of PharMEDium tangible assets and all of the remaining $185 million of PharMEDium intangible assets in the three months ending March 31, 2020. Additionally, the Company will incur other costs, such as employee separation costs, in connection with exiting the PharMEDium compounding business during the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020 estimated to total approximately $80 million to $100 million.

As a result of the decision to exit the PharMEDium compounding business, the Company expects to claim an ordinary income tax deduction and estimates that it will realize a cash tax benefit in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022 totaling approximately $500 million to $600 million.

Item 2.06. Material Impairments.

The information set forth in Item 2.05 is incorporated into this Item 2.06 by reference.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

On January 30, 2020, the Company is conducting a conference call and webcast scheduled to be held at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time regarding its results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019 and related matters.

A link to the conference call and slides prepared for the conference call are available on the Company's website at investor.amerisourcebergen.com. 

The information in this item is being furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. This information shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
