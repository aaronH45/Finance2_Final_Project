Item 8.01. Other Events.

On February 12, 2020, State Street Corporation (“State Street”) announced that it will redeem (the “Redemption”) all 5,000 of its outstanding shares of its non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series C (“Series C preferred stock”) (represented by depositary shares, each representing a 1/4000th interest in a share of Series C preferred stock), for cash at a redemption price (the “Redemption Price”) of $100,000 per share (equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share) plus all declared and unpaid dividends. The Redemption Price will be payable on March 16, 2020. 

On February 12, 2020, State Street also announced that a cash dividend of $1,312.50 per share of Series C preferred stock (or approximately $0.3281 per depositary share) has been declared for the period from December 15, 2019 up to but not including March 15, 2020 (the “final dividend”). The final dividend will be paid separately to the holders of record of the Series C preferred stock as of March 2, 2020, in the customary manner. Accordingly, there will not be any declared and unpaid dividends included in the Redemption Price.

The Redemption is in addition to State Street’s original capital plan, submitted as part of the 2019 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) cycle and previously announced on June 27, 2019, and has received approval from the Federal Reserve.

First quarter 2020 results will include $9 million in accelerated Series C preferred stock-related costs. In 2019, Series C preferred stock paid total dividends of $26 million.
