Cardinal Health Reports Second Quarter Results for Fiscal Year 2020

•Revenue increased 5% to $39.7 billion

•GAAP diluted EPS were $0.75, non-GAAP diluted EPS were $1.52

•Company raises FY20 guidance

DUBLIN, Ohio, February 6, 2020 - Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH) today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 ended December 31, 2019. Second quarter revenue was $39.7 billion, an increase of 5% from the second quarter of last year. 

Second quarter GAAP operating earnings decreased 34% to $334 million, which included a $96 million charge in connection to the recently announced voluntary surgical gown-related recalls. Non-GAAP operating earnings increased 1% to $646 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) decreased 19% to $0.75, while non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 18% to $1.52. Non-GAAP diluted EPS benefited from a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count.

“With the first half of the year behind us, we are raising our fiscal year 2020 guidance,” said Mike Kaufmann, CEO of Cardinal Health. “This increase was driven by improved performance across our Pharmaceutical segment, particularly within our generics program. As we look forward, we remain focused on executing our strategic growth initiatives.”

Segment results

Pharmaceutical segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Second quarter revenue for the Pharmaceutical segment increased 6% to $35.7 billion, due to sales growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers.

Pharmaceutical segment profit increased 4% to $462 million in the second quarter, reflecting positive performance in the company’s generics program and Specialty Solutions business. This was partially offset by the adverse impact of Pharmaceutical Distribution customer contract renewals.

Medical segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Medical segment profit does not include the $96 million charge incurred for inventory write-offs and certain remediation and supply disruption costs associated with the recently announced voluntary surgical gown-related recalls.

Second quarter revenue for the Medical segment was flat at $4.0 billion. Growth in Cardinal Health at Home was offset by a decline in products and distribution.

Medical segment profit increased 4% to $195 million in the second quarter. This increase reflects benefits from cost savings initiatives, partially offset by a decline in products and distribution.

Tax rate

During the second quarters of fiscal 2020 and 2019, GAAP effective tax rates were 21.0% and 31.0%, respectively. Non-GAAP effective tax rates were 24.8% and 28.5%, respectively. The GAAP effective tax rate benefitted from jurisdictional mix and discrete items recognized in the second quarter of 2020, largely driven by changes as a result of tax reform. The Non-GAAP effective tax rate benefitted from jurisdictional mix.

Fiscal year 2020 Outlook

The company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis as certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated. See "Use of Non-GAAP Measures" following the attached schedules for additional explanation.

The company raises its fiscal year 2020 guidance range for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. to the range of $5.20 to $5.40 from the range of $4.85 to $5.10.

Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Unaudited)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Litigation (recoveries)/charges, net includes a pre-tax charge of $5.63 billion ($5.14 billion after tax) recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 for the estimated liability associated with lawsuits and claims brought against us by states and political subdivisions relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications. In October 2019, we agreed in principle to a global settlement framework with a leadership group of state attorneys general that is designed to resolve all pending and future opioid lawsuits and claims by states and political subdivisions (the "Settlement Framework"). We accrue for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. Final terms of a settlement under the Settlement Framework continue to be negotiated, and there is no assurance that the necessary parties will agree to a definitive settlement agreement or that the contingencies to any agreement will be satisfied. We will regularly review these opioid litigation matters to determine whether our accrual is adequate. We are unable to reasonably estimate the liability associated with any potential distribution of treatment medications and any incremental costs for changes to our controlled substance anti-diversion program that we may agree to under the Settlement Framework. The amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from this accrual.

2 In connection with these matters, we recorded a tax benefit of $487 million, which is net of unrecognized tax benefits of $468 million, during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, reflecting our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid under the $5.63 billion accrual taken in connection with the opioid litigation. Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. For tax benefits that do not qualify for recognition, we recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Our assumptions and estimates around this benefit and uncertain tax position require significant judgment since the definitive settlement terms and documentation, including provisions related to deductibility, under the Settlement Framework have not been negotiated and the U.S. tax law governing deductibility was changed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). We have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on management's judgment and our current understanding of the Tax Act which is subject to further interpretation by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Further, it is possible that the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation 

of the Tax Act or the estimates and assumptions used to assess the future deductibility of these benefits. The actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ materially from these estimates.

3 Due to the net loss for the six months ended December 31, 2019, potentially dilutive common shares have not been included in the denominator of the dilutive per share computation due to their anti-dilutive effect.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures

This earnings release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP"). 

In addition to analyzing our business based on financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate our performance, engage in financial and operational planning, and, in most cases, determine incentive compensation because we believe that these measures provide additional perspective on and, in some circumstances are more closely correlated to, the performance of our underlying, ongoing business. We provide these non-GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on our financial and operating results on a year-over-year basis and in comparing our performance to that of our competitors. However, the non-GAAP financial measures that we use may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by us should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth below should be carefully evaluated. 

Exclusions from Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Management believes it is useful to exclude the following items from the non-GAAP measures presented in this report for its own and for investors’ assessment of the business for the reasons identified below: 

•LIFO charges and credits are excluded because the factors that drive last-in first-out ("LIFO") inventory charges or credits, such as pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and year-end inventory levels (which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal year-end), are largely out of our control and cannot be accurately predicted. The exclusion of LIFO charges and credits from non-GAAP metrics facilitates comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies’ financial results. 

•Surgical gown recall costs includes inventory write-offs and certain remediation and supply disruption costs arising from the January 2020 recall of select Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) Level 3 surgical gowns and voluntary field actions (a recall of some packs and a corrective action allowing overlabeling of other packs) for Presource Procedure Packs containing affected gowns. We have excluded these costs from our non-GAAP metrics to allow investors to better understand the underlying operating results of the business and to facilitate comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies’ financial results. 

•State opioid assessments related to prior fiscal years is the portion of state assessments for prescription opioid medications that were sold or distributed in periods prior to the fiscal year of the initial assessment. This portion is excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because it is retrospectively applied to sales in prior fiscal years and inclusion would obscure analysis of the current fiscal year results of our underlying, ongoing business. Additionally, while states' laws may require us to make payments on an ongoing basis, the portion of the assessment related to sales in prior periods are contemplated to be one-time, nonrecurring items. Reversals of these accruals have occurred when certain assessments were declared unconstitutional.

•Restructuring and employee severance costs are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business.

•Amortization and other acquisition-related costs, which include transaction costs, integration costs, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations, are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business and to facilitate comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies' financial results. Additionally, costs for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets are non-cash amounts, which are variable in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical, current and forecasted financial results. We also exclude other acquisition-related costs, which are directly related to an acquisition but do not meet the criteria to be recognized on the acquired entity’s initial balance sheet as part of the purchase price allocation. These costs are also significantly impacted by the timing, complexity and size of acquisitions.

•Impairments and gain or loss on disposal of assets are excluded because they do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our ongoing business operations and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount, and in the case of impairments, are non-cash amounts, so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical, current and forecasted financial results.

•Litigation recoveries or charges, net are excluded because they often relate to events that may have occurred in prior or multiple periods, do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our business and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount.

•Loss on extinguishment of debt is excluded because it does not typically occur in the normal course of business and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance. Additionally, the amount and frequency of this type of charge is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt extinguishment transactions.

•Transitional tax benefit, net related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is excluded because it results from the one-time impact of a very significant change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and, due to the significant size of the benefit, obscures analysis of trends and financial performance. The transitional tax benefit includes the initial estimate and subsequent adjustments for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and the repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings.

The tax effect for each of the items listed above, other than the transitional tax benefit item, is determined using the tax rate and other tax attributes applicable to the item and the jurisdiction(s) in which the item is recorded. The gross, tax and net impact of each item are presented with our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.

Forward Looking Non-GAAP Measures

In this document, the Company presents certain forward-looking non-GAAP metrics. The Company does not provide outlook on a GAAP basis because the items that the Company excludes from GAAP to calculate the comparable non-GAAP measure can be dependent on future events that are less capable of being controlled or reliably predicted by management and are not part of the Company’s routine operating activities. Additionally, management does not forecast many of the excluded items for internal use and therefore cannot create or rely on outlook done on a GAAP basis. 

The occurrence, timing and amount of any of the items excluded from GAAP to calculate non-GAAP could significantly impact the Company’s fiscal 2020 GAAP results. Over the past five fiscal years, the excluded items have impacted the Company’s EPS from $0.75 to $4.19, which includes a goodwill impairment charge of $4.36 per share related to our Medical segment that we recognized in fiscal 2018. The excluded items for fiscal 2020 year to date period impacted the Company's EPS by $18.79, which includes a $17.49 charge related to the opioid litigation.
