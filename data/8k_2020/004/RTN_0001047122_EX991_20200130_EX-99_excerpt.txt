__________________________________________________________________________________________________

WALTHAM, Mass., (January 30, 2020) - Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) today announced net sales for the fourth quarter 2019 of $7.8 billion, up 6.5 percent compared to $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter 2018. Fourth quarter 2019 EPS from continuing operations was $3.16 compared to $2.93 in the fourth quarter 2018. The increase in the fourth quarter 2019 EPS from continuing operations was primarily driven by operational improvements. 

Net sales in 2019 were $29.2 billion, up 7.8 percent compared to $27.1 billion in 2018. Full-year 2019 EPS from continuing operations was $11.92 compared to $10.15 for the full-year 2018.

The previously announced merger with United Technologies is targeted to close early in the second quarter of 2020, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals, as well as completion by United Technologies of the separation of its Otis and Carrier businesses.

“Raytheon had a very successful year in 2019, delivering record bookings, backlog, sales and operating cash flow,” said Thomas A. Kennedy, Raytheon Chairman and CEO. “Our results reflect the continued hard work and dedication of the Raytheon team and position us well for the future.

“Integration planning for the merger with United Technologies is progressing well, with the integration team developing detailed execution plans to capture revenue and cost synergies rapidly and ensure seamless operations post close. Our goal is to close the merger early in the second quarter of 2020.”

The company generated strong operating cash flow for both the fourth quarter and full-year 2019. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $2.8 billion for the fourth quarter 2019 and $4.5 billion for the full-year 2019, and was better than the company’s prior guidance primarily due to improved working capital. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter 2018. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $3.4 billion for the full-year 2018, after making a $1.25 billion pretax discretionary pension contribution in the third quarter 2018.

The company had record bookings of $12.1 billion in the fourth quarter 2019, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.54. Fourth quarter 2018 bookings were $8.4 billion. Full-year 2019 bookings were a record $36.3 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.25. Full-year 2018 bookings were $32.2 billion.

In addition, as previously announced, in the fourth quarter 2019, Raytheon was selected by the U.S. Army to develop the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS).

Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) had fourth quarter 2019 net sales of $1,981 million, up 18 percent compared to $1,684 million in the fourth quarter 2018. IDS had full-year 2019 net sales of $6,927 million compared to $6,180 million in 2018. The increase in net sales for both the quarter and the full-year was primarily driven by higher net sales on an international air and missile defense system program awarded in the third quarter 2019 and an international missile defense radar program.

IDS recorded $307 million of operating income in the fourth quarter 2019 compared to $247 million in the fourth quarter 2018. The increase in operating income for the quarter was primarily driven by higher volume and higher net program efficiencies. IDS recorded $1,111 million of operating income in 2019 compared to $1,023 million in 2018. The increase in operating income for the full-year was primarily driven by higher volume.

During the quarter, IDS booked $1.1 billion on two direct commercial contracts to provide advanced Patriot® air and missile defense capability to existing international customers; $365 million on the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) program for the U.S. Navy; $144 million on the Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance-Model 2 (AN/TPY-2) radar program for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA); $134 million to provide Consolidated Contractor Logistics Support (CCLS) for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA); and $118 million on the Aegis weapon system for the U.S. Navy and international customers.

IIS had full-year 2019 net sales of $7,151 million compared to $6,722 million in 2018. The increase in net sales for the full-year was primarily driven by higher net sales on classified programs in both cyber and space.

IIS recorded $149 million of operating income in the fourth quarter 2019 compared to $144 million in the fourth quarter 2018. IIS recorded $658 million of operating income in 2019 compared to $538 million in 2018.

MS had full-year 2019 net sales of $8,726 million compared to $8,298 million in 2018. The increase in net sales for the full-year was primarily due to higher net sales on classified programs.

MS recorded $297 million of operating income in the fourth quarter 2019 compared to $273 million in the fourth quarter 2018. The increase in operating income for the quarter was primarily driven by a favorable change in program mix and higher net program efficiencies. MS recorded $959 million of operating income in 2019 compared to $973 million in 2018. The decrease in operating income for the full-year was primarily due to lower net program efficiencies, partially offset by higher volume.

During the quarter, MS booked $1,033 million for Standard Missile-6 (SM-6®) for the U.S. Navy; $893 million for Standard Missile-3 (SM-3®) for the MDA and an international customer; $795 million for Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM®) for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and international customers; $290 million for Paveway™ for the U.S. Air Force and international customers; $155 million for Evolved Seasparrow Missile (ESSM®) for the U.S. Navy and international customers; and $109 million for Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD®) for the U.S. Navy.

SAS recorded $278 million of operating income in the fourth quarter 2019 compared to $262 million in the fourth quarter 2018. SAS recorded $991 million of operating income in 2019 compared to $884 million in 2018.
