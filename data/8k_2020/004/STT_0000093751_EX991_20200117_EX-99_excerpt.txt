IN THIS NEWS RELEASE:

•Expenses and other measures are sometimes presented excluding notable items, such as seasonal and CRD expenses. This is a non-GAAP presentation. See the Addendum to this News Release for an explanation and reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures and CRD expenses. The 2019 expense savings program is stated on a gross basis. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•New asset servicing mandates, including announced front-to-back investment servicing clients, may be subject to completion of definitive agreements, approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary regulatory approvals. New asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude new business which has been contracted, but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and is not yet installed. These excluded assets, which from time to time may be significant, will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission. Servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis and therefore also do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with State Street, which from time to time may be significant. 

•New business in assets to be serviced is reflected in our AUC/A after we begin servicing the assets, and new business in assets to be managed is reflected in our AUM after we begin managing the assets. As such, only a portion of any new asset servicing and asset management mandates may be reflected in our AUC/A and AUM as of any particular date specified. Generally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net new business and the manner in which we price our services. We provide a range of services to our clients, including core custody services, accounting, reporting and administration and middle office services, and the nature and mix of services provided affects our servicing fees. The basis for fees will differ across regions and clients. The industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today. Consequently, no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins or new servicing business yet to be installed, as the amount of revenue associated with AUC/A can vary materially. Management fees generally are affected by our level of AUM and differ based upon the nature, type and investment strategy of the investment product. Management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. Additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue. While certain management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors, including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients.

•State Street’s common stock and other stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount, remain subject to consideration and approval by State Street’s Board of Directors at the relevant times. State Street's $2 billion common stock repurchase authorization was effective beginning July 1, 2019 and covers the period ending June 30, 2020. Stock purchases may be made using various types of transactions, including open-market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or other transactions off the market, and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing of stock purchases, type of transaction and number of shares purchased will depend on several factors, including market conditions and State Street’s capital position, its financial performance, the amount of common stock issued as part of employee compensation programs and investment opportunities. The common stock purchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time. 

•2019 expense program savings stated on a gross basis. Process re-engineering and automation savings, as presented in this News Release, can include high-cost location workforce reductions, reducing manual/bespoke activities, reducing redundant activities, streamlining operational centers and moves to common platforms/retiring legacy applications. Resource discipline benefits, as presented in this News Release, can include reducing senior management headcount, rigorous performance management, vendor management and optimization of real estate.

•Distribution fees from the SPDR® Gold ETF and the SPDR® Long Dollar Gold Trust ETF are recorded in brokerage and other fee revenue and not in management fee revenue. 

•During the first quarter of 2019, we voluntarily changed our accounting method under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures, for investments in low income housing tax credit from the equity method of accounting to the proportional amortization method of accounting. This change in accounting method has been applied retrospectively to all prior periods. Refer to the Form 8-K filed on March 5, 2019 for further details.
