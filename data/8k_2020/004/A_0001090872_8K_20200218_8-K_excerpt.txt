Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

The information in this Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto is furnished and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

On February 18, 2020, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) issued its press release announcing financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2020. A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

The Company provides non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its operational performance and to enhance its investors’ overall understanding of its core current financial performance and its prospects for the future. The Company believes that its investors benefit from seeing its results “through the eyes” of management in addition to the GAAP presentation. Management measures segment and enterprise performance using measures such as those that are disclosed in this release. This information facilitates management’s internal comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results and comparisons to competitors’ operating results. Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operations decision making. Historically, the Company has reported similar non-GAAP information to its investors and believes that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting.

This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company’s expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that the Company's GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company. The non-GAAP information the Company provides may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
