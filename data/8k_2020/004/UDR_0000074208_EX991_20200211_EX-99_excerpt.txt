   ·    Net income attributable to common stockholders was $96.9 million as compared to $81.2 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to net operating income (“NOI”) growth and higher gains on the sale of unconsolidated investments. 

   ·    Year-over-year (“YOY”) same-store (“SS”) revenue, expense and NOI growth was 3.3 percent, 1.3 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively.  

   ·    The Company’s operating margin (property NOI divided by property rental income) was 71.1 percent as compared to 70.8 percent in the prior year period. The continued implementation of the Company’s Next Generation Operating Platform drove SS controllable operating margin expansion of 60 basis points YOY to 84.8 percent, and reduced SS controllable expenses by 0.6 percent YOY. 

   ·    Simplified the Company’s structure by closing a previously announced $1.8 billion transaction to halve the size of the UDR/MetLife Joint Venture in an accretive manner.  

   ·    Invested $115.0 million in Brio, a 259-home Developer Capital Program community in Bellevue, WA.

 Full-Year 2019 Highlights:  

   ·    Net income per share was $0.63, FFO per share was $2.03, FFOA per share was $2.08, and AFFO per share was $1.92.  

   ·    Net income attributable to common stockholders was $180.9 million as compared to $199.2 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower gains on the sale of real estate. 

   ·    YOY SS revenue, expense and NOI growth was 3.6 percent, 2.5 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively.  

   ·    The Company’s operating margin (property NOI divided by property rental income) was 71.0 percent as compared to 70.7 percent in the prior year period. The Company’s Next Generation Operating Platform drove controllable operating margin expansion of 50 basis points YOY to 84.6 percent, and limited SS controllable expense growth to 0.9 percent YOY. 

   ·    Installed SmartHome technology in 30,370 homes, or 60 percent of total homes, as of year-end. 

   ·    Accretively grew the Company through $1.8 billion of acquisitions with significant operating/investment upside in markets targeted for expansion. 

   ·    Simplified the Company’s structure by winding down the UDR/Kuwait Finance House (“KFH”) JV and halving the size of the UDR/MetLife JV in an accretive manner.  

   ·    Funded accretive external growth with premium valued equity by issuing approximately 15.8 million common shares at a weighted average net price of $45.85 for proceeds of $725.6 million.

 “2019 was an active and very successful year for UDR and our investors. We accretively grew the Company through $1.8 billion of well-timed acquisitions, realized efficiencies and controllable margin expansion from implementing the initial phases of our Next Generation Operating Platform, advanced our predictive analytics platform which we use for market selection, simplified our structure by winding down the KFH JV and halving our relationship with MetLife, and actively de-risked our balance sheet in an accretive manner. 2020 has started off well. We expect it will be another great year for UDR and our investors,” said Tom Toomey, UDR’s Chairman and CEO.
