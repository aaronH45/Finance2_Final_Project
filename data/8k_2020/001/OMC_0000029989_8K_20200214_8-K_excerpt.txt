Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 

On February 14, 2020, Omnicom Group Inc. (“Omnicom Group”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries Omnicom Capital Inc. and Omnicom Finance Limited (collectively, with any other subsidiary of Omnicom Group designated for borrowing privileges from time to time, the “Borrowers” and, together with Omnicom Group, the “Loan Parties”) entered into a Second Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with the lenders named therein (the “Lenders”), Citibank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as lead arrangers and book managers, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as syndication agents, Bank of America, N.A., BNP Paribas, Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as documentation agents, and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent for the Lenders (the “Agent”). The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of February 14, 2025, which may be extended subject to certain conditions for up to an additional two years. Under the Credit Agreement, the Lenders committed to provide advances in an aggregate amount of up to US$2,500,000,000 (with a commitment increase without further amendment at the option of Omnicom Group of up to US$500,000,000 for an aggregate amount of up to US$3,000,000,000) of which up to US$100,000,000 may be in the form of letters of credit at the request of a Borrower. Interest on the borrowings under the Credit Agreement is payable at a base rate or Eurocurrency rate, in either case plus an applicable margin and fees. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes of the Borrowers and their subsidiaries, including, without limitation, to fund acquisitions not prohibited under the Credit Agreement. 

The terms of the Credit Agreement include representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants (including certain financial covenants) and events of default that are customary for credit facilities of this nature. Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an event of default, including but not limited to nonpayment of principal when due, nonpayment of interest within five business days after it becomes due, failure to perform or observe certain terms, covenants or agreements under the Credit Agreement, and certain defaults of other indebtedness, the Agent may terminate the obligation of the Lenders under the Credit Agreement to make advances and issue letters of credit and declare any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable. In addition, in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to any Loan Party under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, the obligation of the Lenders to make advances and issue letters of credit shall automatically terminate and any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement shall immediately become due and payable. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, Omnicom Group may request that the Lenders’ commitments under the Credit Agreement be increased, provided that in no event may the aggregate amount of the Lenders’ commitments under the Credit Agreement at any time exceed US$3,000,000,000. 

The obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Omnicom Group. 

The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties’ rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement. The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
