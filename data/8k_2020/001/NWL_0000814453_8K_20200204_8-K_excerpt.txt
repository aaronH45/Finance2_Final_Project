Bonus Program  

On February 4, 2020, the Organizational Development & Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) used its discretion under the Newell Brands Inc. Management Bonus Plan (the “Bonus Plan”) under the shareholder approved 2013 Incentive Plan to establish the performance criteria for the 2020 bonus awards. For each named executive officer, 2020 bonus awards will be tied to corporate performance goals previously approved by the Company’s shareholders, including adjusted operating cashflow, core sales growth and adjusted earnings per share. Following completion of 2020, named executive officers are eligible to receive a bonus equal to such named executive officer’s base salary multiplied by the product of the target payout percentage described below and the Aggregate Corporate Performance Bonus Multiplier (as defined below), in each case based on attainment of applicable corporate performance goals, and subject to adjustment up or down, based on individual performance, quality of results or other factors deemed relevant by the Committee.  

The “Aggregate Corporate Performance Bonus Multiplier” is a percentage from 0% to 200% determined by the Committee based on specified performance criteria for each applicable 2020 bonus award. The named executive officers participate in the 2020 Bonus Plan with a target payout equal to the percentage of their respective base salary as set forth below. In order to receive their bonuses, participants are generally required to continue to be employed by the Company through the date of payment of the bonus. The amount awarded to a named executive officer under the Bonus Plan will range between 0% and 200% of the target payout indicated below, based on the extent to which applicable performance criteria are met.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Russ Torres will not be eligible for a 2020 bonus award because he will be leaving the Company effective March 8, 2020.
