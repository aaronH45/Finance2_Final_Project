Election of Joseph Dunford Jr. to the Board of Directors

On January 24, 2020, the Board of Directors of Lockheed Martin Corporation (“Lockheed Martin” or the “Corporation”) elected former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph F. Dunford Jr. as a director of the Corporation, effective February 10, 2020. General Dunford will serve on the Corporation's Classified Business and Security Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

The Board of Directors determined that General Dunford is an "independent director" in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Corporation's corporate governance guidelines. 

General Dunford, age 64, served as the 19th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2015 until his retirement in September 2019. His previous assignments include serving as the 36th Commandant of the Marine Corps and the Commander of all U.S. and NATO Forces in Afghanistan. Commissioned in 1977, General Dunford served as an infantry officer at all levels, including commanding the 5th Marine Regiment during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

For his service on the Board of Directors, General Dunford will receive the Corporation's standard compensation for non-employee directors. A description of such standard compensation arrangement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 29, 2019 and incorporated herein by reference. Equity grants to General Dunford will be made in accordance with the Lockheed Martin Corporation Amended and Restated Directors Equity Plan, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Corporation's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 26, 2018 and incorporated herein by reference. General Dunford is also eligible to defer up to 100% of his cash fees into the Lockheed Martin Corporation Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and is incorporated herein by reference. Deferred amounts track the performance of investment options available under the Corporation's employee deferred compensation plans or the Corporation's common stock (with dividends reinvested), at the director's election.

General Dunford will also be covered by the Corporation's standard indemnification agreement with directors which the Corporation enters into with all directors. A copy of the form of indemnification agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.34 to the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and is incorporated herein by reference.
