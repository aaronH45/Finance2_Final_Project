Item 5.04 Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant’s Employee Benefit Plans. 

Ingersoll-Rand plc (the “Company”) is making changes to certain of its benefit plans to convert a stock fund within those plans into two new stock funds. In connection with these changes, on January 27, 2020, the Company sent a notice to its directors and executive officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, informing them of a blackout period that begins at the close of market (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on February 27, 2020 and expected to end the week of March 1, 2020 (the “Blackout Period”) that is being imposed on participants in the Ingersoll-Rand Company Employee Savings Plan, the Ingersoll-Rand Company Employee Savings Plan for Bargained Employees, the Ingersoll-Rand Individual Account Retirement Plan for Bargaining Unit Employees at the Buffalo, New York Plant, the Ingersoll-Rand Retirement Savings Plan for Participating Affiliates in Puerto Rico, the Trane 401(k) and Thrift Plan and the Ingersoll Rand Industrial U.S., Inc. Employee Savings Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) and notifying them of the trading restrictions applicable to them during this Blackout Period. During the Blackout Period, participants and beneficiaries in the Plans will be unable to request exchanges or obtain loans or receive distributions that involve Plan assets invested in the Ingersoll-Rand Unitized Stock Fund. 

During the Blackout Period and for a period of two years after the expiration of the Blackout Period, executive officers and directors of the Company, and security holders or other interested persons, may obtain, without charge, information about this notice or about the actual beginning and ending dates of the Blackout Period by contacting Evan M. Turtz at (704) 655-4000 or 800-E Beaty Street, Davidson, North Carolina 28036. 

This notice was sent pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Regulation BTR, which generally prohibit executive officers and directors of an issuer from engaging in transactions involving the issuer’s equity securities acquired in connection with their service or employment as director or executive officer during any retirement plan blackout period. 

A copy of the form of notice to directors and executive officers, which includes the information specified in Rule 104(b) of Regulation BTR, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
