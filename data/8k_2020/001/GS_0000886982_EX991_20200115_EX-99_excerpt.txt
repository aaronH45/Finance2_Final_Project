Provision for Taxes  

The effective income tax rate for 2019 was 20.0%, down from 20.7% for the first nine months of 2019 due to the impact of regulatory guidance released in the fourth quarter related to the international provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation), partially offset by the impact of provisions for non-deductible litigation. The 2019 effective income tax rate increased from 16.2% for full year 2018, as 2018 included a $487 million income tax benefit related to the finalization of the enactment impact of Tax Legislation.
