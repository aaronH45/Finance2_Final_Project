 Public Storage Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2019  

 GLENDALE, California – Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) announced today operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2019.    

 Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2019  

 For the three months ended December 31, 2019, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $327.3 million or $1.87 per diluted common share, compared to $530.1 million or $3.04 per diluted common share in 2018 representing a decrease of $202.8 million or $1.17 per diluted common share. The decrease is due primarily to (i) $183.1 million in aggregate gains due to Shurgard Self Storage SA’s (“Shurgard’s”) initial public offering and the sale of our facility in West London to Shurgard in October 2018, (ii) a $15.7 million decrease due to the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses associated with our euro denominated debt and (iii) a $6.2 million allocation to our preferred shareholders associated with our preferred share redemption activities in the three months ended December 31, 2019, offset partially by (iv) a $10.3 million increase in self-storage net operating income (described below) and (v) a reduction in general and administrative expense attributable to $8.1 million in incremental share-based compensation expense in the three months ended December 31, 2018 for the planned retirement of our former CEO and CFO.  

 The $10.3 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $0.7 million increase in our Same Store Facilities (as defined below) and a $9.6 million increase in our non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 1.1% or $6.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 4.6% or $5.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018, due primarily to a 40% ($3.7 million) increase in marketing expenses, increased property manager payroll and increased property tax expense. The increase in net operating income of $9.6 million for the non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2018 and 2019 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.   

 Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2019  

 In 2019, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1,272.8 million or $7.29 per diluted common share, compared to $1,488.9 million or $8.54 per diluted common share in 2018 representing a decrease of $216.1 million or $1.25 per diluted common share. The decrease is due primarily to (i) $183.1 million in aggregate gains due to Shurgard’s initial public offering and the sale of our facility in West London to Shurgard in October 2018, (ii) our $37.7 million equity share of gains recorded by PS Business Parks during 2018, (iii) a $10.3 million decrease due to the impact of foreign currency exchange gains associated with our euro denominated debt and (iv) a $32.7 million allocation to our preferred shareholders associated with our preferred share redemption activities in 2019. These impacts were offset partially by a $30.1 million increase in self-storage net operating income (described below) and a reduction in general and administrative expense attributable to $30.7 million in incremental share-based compensation expense in 2018 for the planned retirement of our former CEO and CFO.  

 The $30.1 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $2.6 million increase in our Same Store Facilities and $27.5 million increase in our non-Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 1.4% or $33.3 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 5.0% or $30.6 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, due primarily to a 47.2% ($15.3 million) increase in marketing expenses and increased property taxes. The increase in net operating income of $27.5 million for the non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2018 and 2019 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.

 Funds from Operations  

 For the three months ended December 31, 2019, funds from operations (“FFO”) was $2.72 per diluted common share, as compared to $2.77 in 2018, representing a decrease of 1.8%. FFO is a non-GAAP measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and generally represents net income before depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses and impairment charges with respect to real estate assets. A reconciliation of GAAP diluted net income per share to FFO per share, and additional descriptive information regarding this non-GAAP measure, is attached.  

 For the year ended December 31, 2019, FFO was $10.58 per diluted common share, as compared to $10.45 in 2018, representing an increase of 1.2%.  

 We also present “Core FFO per share,” a non-GAAP measure that represents FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (ii) EITF D-42 charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, (iii) accelerations of accruals or reductions in accruals due to the departure of senior executives and (iv) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items. We review Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance, and we believe it is used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However, Core FFO per share is not a substitute for net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology or may not present such a measure, Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.   

 The following table reconciles from FFO per share to Core FFO per share (unaudited):

 Property Operations – Same Store Facilities  

 The Same Store Facilities represent those facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy, revenues and cost of operations since January 1, 2017. We review the operations of our Same Store Facilities, which excludes facilities whose operating trends are significantly affected by factors such as casualty events, as well as recently developed or acquired facilities, to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2017, 2018 and 2019. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2,159 facilities (139.3 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 82% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2019.

   (c)    Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency, and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income.  

   (d)    Annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis, such as late charges and administrative fees, does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts, and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible.

 On November 26, 2019, we called our 5.875% Series A Preferred Shares for redemption. The shares were redeemed on December 30, 2019.  

 On December 20, 2019, we issued our 4.75% Series K Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $230 million.

 As we reported in an SEC form 8-K on February 14, 2020, we submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the issued stapled securities of National Storage REIT (“NSR”), an Australia-based publicly-traded REIT (ASX:NSR) that owns and operates 167 self-storage facilities in Australia and New Zealand, for a cash purchase price of A$2.40 per share. Our proposal was subject to a number of conditions, including due diligence. Any transaction would be subject to processes for acquisition of widely held entities under Australian law, including securityholder approval. There is no assurance that Public Storage will reach a definitive agreement or consummate a transaction with NSR or that if such an agreement is reached, it will be on terms consistent with our non-binding proposal.  

 Distributions Declared  

 On February 21, 2020, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $2.00 per common share.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

   (a)    The reduction in equity in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects a $35.3 million reduction in our equity earnings from PSB due primarily to a reduction in our equity share of PSB’s gains on sale, offset partially by a $1.3 million increase in equity in earnings from Shurgard. The increase in equity in earnings for Shurgard reflects i) our $5.2 million equity share of costs of the IPO and casualty losses incurred by Shurgard in 2018 and ii) a $10.1 million reduction in our equity share of depreciation, offset partially by iii) an approximate $14.0 million reduction in our equity share of core FFO from Shurgard. The reductions in our equity share of Core FFO and depreciation from Shurgard is due primarily to Shurgard’s IPO on October 15, 2018, which reduced our equity interest from 49% to approximately 35%, and resulted in dilution from approximately €199 million in Shurgard’s IPO proceeds that remained uninvested in real estate at December 31, 2019.

 Net Income  

 (Unaudited – amounts in thousands)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (a)    Net operating income or “NOI” is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense, which is based upon historical costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. We utilize NOI in determining current property values, evaluating property performance, and in evaluating operating trends. We believe that investors and analysts utilize NOI in a similar manner. NOI is not a substitute for net income, operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results. This table reconciles from NOI for our self-storage facilities to the net income presented on our income statement.
