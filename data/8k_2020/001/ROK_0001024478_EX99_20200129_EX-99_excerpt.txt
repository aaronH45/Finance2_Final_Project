MILWAUKEE (January 29, 2020) — Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE: ROK) today reported fiscal 2020 first quarter results.

"Despite a difficult macro environment for manufacturers, first quarter sales and Adjusted EPS were slightly better than we expected. We saw growth in Automotive and Semiconductor as well as strength in China. Our first quarter sales also included strong double-digit growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services and a significant contribution from our inorganic investments." said Blake D. Moret, Chairman and CEO. "Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to look for opportunities to accelerate progress on our strategic priorities."

Fiscal 2020 first quarter sales were $1,684.5 million, up 2.6 percent from $1,642.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Organic sales declined 1.0 percent, currency translation decreased sales by 0.9 percentage points, and acquisitions increased sales by 4.5 percent.

Fiscal 2020 first quarter net income attributable to Rockwell Automation was $310.7 million or $2.66 per share, compared to $80.3 million or $0.66 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increases in net income attributable to Rockwell Automation and EPS were primarily due to fair-value adjustments recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019 in connection with our investment in PTC (the "PTC adjustments"). Fiscal 2020 first quarter Adjusted EPS was $2.11, down 5 percent compared to $2.21 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease in Adjusted EPS was primarily due to lower organic sales, higher investment spending, and unfavorable mix, partially offset by a lower share count and lower tax rate. The net year-over-year Adjusted EPS impact of Sensia was $0.01.

Pre-tax margin was 19.9 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to 7.4 percent in the same period last year. The increase in pre-tax margin was due to the PTC adjustments. 

Total segment operating margin was 20.1 percent compared to 22.8 percent a year ago. The decrease in total segment operating margin was primarily due to Sensia one-time items, higher investment spending, and unfavorable mix. Total segment operating earnings were $339.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, down 9.5 percent from $374.9 million in the same period of fiscal 2019. 

Cash flow provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $231.1 million, compared to $212.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Free cash flow was $194.1 million, compared to $170.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

"The macro-environment is showing signs of stabilization, and I am confident in our ability to execute and gain share as we build long-term value for our customers, shareowners, and employees," Moret added, commenting on the outlook. "In the quarter, we had significant new wins across our Connected Enterprise portfolio as we guide customers on their digital transformation journeys. We are at the forefront of the convergence of IT and OT. This is an exciting time for Rockwell as we extend our leadership position as an industrial technology company,” Moret concluded.

Supplemental Information

General Corporate Net - Fiscal 2020 first quarter general corporate-net expense was $32.8 million compared to $21.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to benefit-related adjustments and one-time costs related to Sensia.

Purchase Accounting Depreciation and Amortization - Fiscal 2020 first quarter purchase accounting depreciation and amortization expense was $10.0 million, up $5.9 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2019, resulting in a year-over-year decrease in Adjusted EPS of $0.02.

The lower effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the PTC adjustments, a tax benefit related to Sensia, and other discrete items. The Adjusted Effective Tax Rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 7.9 percent compared to 18.7 percent in the prior year. The lower Adjusted Effective Tax Rate in 2020 is primarily due to a tax benefit related to Sensia and other discrete items.

We exclude purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, general corporate – net, non-operating pension and postretirement benefit credit (cost), gains and losses on investments, valuation adjustments related to the registration of PTC Shares, gains and losses from the disposition of businesses, interest (expense) income, net and income tax provision because we do not consider these costs to be directly related to the operating performance of our segments.

We use these measures to monitor and evaluate the profitability of our operating segments. Our measures of total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin may be different from measures used by other companies.

Organic Sales

We translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States using exchange rates effective during the respective period. Therefore, changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales. Sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales. We believe that organic sales, defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. When we divest a business, we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year, excluding divestitures. We attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.

The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to sales for the three months ended December 31, 2018:

Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate

Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate are non-GAAP earnings measures that exclude non-operating pension and postretirement benefit cost (credit), net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, gains and losses on investments, and valuation adjustments related to the registration of PTC Shares, including their respective tax effects.  

We believe that Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate provide useful information to our investors about our operating performance and allow management and investors to compare our operating performance period over period. Adjusted EPS is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation. Our measures of Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate may be different from measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for net income attributable to Rockwell Automation, diluted EPS and effective tax rate. 

The following are the components of operating and non-operating pension and postretirement benefit cost (in millions):

Free Cash Flow

Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance, including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies.

The following table summarizes free cash flow by quarter:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1Includes a payment of $31.1 million for taxes due under the Tax Act related to deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and a payment of $35.7 million to settle hedges executed in connection with our issuance of $1.0 billion of long-term notes in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.

Return On Invested Capital

Our press release contains information regarding Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that ROIC is useful to investors as a measure of performance and of the effectiveness of the use of capital in our operations. We use ROIC as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance, including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation. Our measure of ROIC may be different from that used by other companies. We define ROIC as the percentage resulting from the following calculation:

(a) Net Income, before interest expense, income tax provision, and purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, divided by;

(b) average invested capital for the year, calculated as a five quarter rolling average using the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt, shareowners’ equity, and accumulated amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, minus cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and long-term investments (fixed income securities), multiplied by;

(c) one minus the effective tax rate for the period.

ROIC is calculated as follows (in millions, except percentages):

1The income tax provision used to calculate the effective tax rate is adjusted to remove amounts associated with the enactment of the Tax Act. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, these adjustments were zero and $58.6 million, respectively.
