  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   •    

The 10% increase in 2019 net revenues in the non-trading segments reflected 8% organic growth and a 3% positive impact from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1% negative impact from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates.  

   •    

Fourth quarter 2019 net revenues were $646 million. Revenues in the non-trading segments increased 9% versus the prior year period, primarily driven by organic growth, while Market Services revenues decreased 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, which featured near record volumes and revenues.

During 2019, the company returned $505 million to shareholders, including $200 million through its share buyback program and $305 million through quarterly dividends, while also completing a multi-year deleveraging objective.  

New York, N.Y.- Nasdaq, Inc. (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019.  

2019 net revenues were $2,535 million, an increase of $9 million from $2,526 million in the prior year. The full year increase in net revenues included a $112 million positive impact from organic growth in the non-trading segments, partially offset by a $29 million organic decrease in Market Services, a $39 million negative net impact from acquisitions and divestitures and a $35 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.  

Fourth quarter 2019 net revenues were $646 million, up $1 million from $645 million in the prior year period. Net revenues reflected a $22 million positive impact from organic growth in the non-trading segments, a $15 million increase from the inclusion of revenues from acquisitions, partially offset by a $21 million organic decrease in Market Services revenues, a $10 million negative impact from divestitures and a $5 million unfavorable impact from changes in exchange rates.  

“We are pleased with our progress in 2019 through the combination of our clear strategic direction, our unwavering commitment to clients and our disciplined execution,” said Adena Friedman, President and CEO, Nasdaq. “Specifically, we continued to adapt and broaden our offerings and deepen our client relationships, while delivering consistently on the organic growth, scalability, and return objectives we established at the onset of our strategic pivot. While still in the early stages of repositioning Nasdaq as a technology and analytics provider, we enter 2020 with clear momentum carried over from our strong finish in 2019, and will continue working to open additional areas of opportunity as the year progresses.”

Refer to our reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss), diluted earnings (loss) per share, operating income and operating expenses, included in the attached schedules.  

1   

GAAP operating expenses were $386 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $18 million from $404 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease primarily reflects lower general, administrative and other expense, lower professional and contract services expense, lower merger and strategic initiatives expense and lower depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by higher compensation expense and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2019.  

Non-GAAP operating expenses were $335 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $5 million, or 2%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. This reflects an $8 million organic expense increase and a $1 million increase from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by a $4 million favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.  

“In 2019, we continued to reallocate capital and resources strategically to support our most significant growth opportunities while also demonstrating how a more scalable business can drive higher operating leverage and efficiency,” said Michael Ptasznik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Nasdaq. “With our strong cash flow generation, we also completed a multi-year deleveraging program, while also increasing our quarterly dividend and continuing to execute our share repurchase program.”  

On a GAAP basis, net income in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $202 million, or diluted earnings per share of $1.21, compared to a net loss of $44 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2018. Net income in 2019 was $774 million, or diluted earnings per share of $4.63, compared to net income of $458 million, or $2.73 per diluted share in 2018.  

On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $215 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, compared to $207 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income in 2019 was $835 million, or $5.00 per diluted share, compared to $797 million, or $4.75 per diluted share in 2018.  

At December 31, 2019, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $332 million and total debt of $3,387 million, resulting in net debt of $3,055 million. This compares to total debt of $3,831 million and net debt of $3,286 million at December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, there was $632 million remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program.  

INITIATING 2020 NON-GAAP EXPENSE AND TAX GUIDANCE1  

The company is initiating its 2020 non-GAAP operating expense guidance in the range of $1,310 to $1,360 million. Nasdaq expects its 2020 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 25.5% to 27.5%.  

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  

Market Services (35% of total net revenues)—Net revenues were $225 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, down $24 million, or 10%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, a period where significantly higher volatility drove near record volumes and revenues.  

Equity Derivative Trading and Clearing (11% of total net revenues)—Net equity derivative trading and clearing revenues were $73 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, down $9 million from the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease primarily reflects lower U.S. industry trading volumes.  

 1   

U.S. GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.  

2   

Cash Equity Trading (10% of total net revenues)—Net cash equity trading revenues were $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, down $11 million from the fourth quarter of 2018. Lower industry volumes and lower overall matched market share executed on Nasdaq’s U.S. exchanges were partially offset by a higher net capture rate.  

Fixed Income and Commodities Trading and Clearing (3% of total net revenues)—Net fixed income and commodities trading and clearing revenues were $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, down $4 million from the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in revenues was primarily driven by lower net revenues due to the sale of the core assets of our NFX business and lower volumes in U.S. fixed income products.  

Trade Management Services (11% of total net revenues)—Trade management services revenues were $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, unchanged compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.  

Corporate Services (20% of total net revenues)—Revenues were $129 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, up $6 million, or 5%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.  

Listing Services (12% of total net revenues)—Listing services revenues were $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, up $3 million from the fourth quarter of 2018. The change primarily reflects higher listing revenues due to an increase in the number of listed companies.  

Corporate Solutions (8% of total net revenues)—Corporate solutions revenues were $52 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $3 million from the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily due to an increase in IR intelligence revenues.  

Information Services (30% of total net revenues)—Revenues were $194 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, up $7 million, or 4%, from the fourth quarter of 2018.  

Market Data (15% of total net revenues)—Market data revenues were $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, down $1 million from the fourth quarter of 2018 due to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates.  

Index (9% of total net revenues)—Index revenues were $57 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, up $3 million from the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily driven by higher licensing revenue from higher average assets under management (AUM) in exchange traded products (ETPs) linked to Nasdaq indexes.  

Investment Data & Analytics (6% of total net revenues)—Investment data & analytics revenues were $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, up $5 million from the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to organic growth in eVestment.  

Market Technology (15% of total net revenues)—Revenues were $98 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, up $22 million, or 29%, from the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase is due to the impact of the acquisition of Cinnober, which added $13 million in revenues, or 17%, as well as organic growth of $9 million, or 12%. The organic growth was primarily driven by an increase in change request revenues and software as a service (SaaS) surveillance revenues and an increase in the size and number of software delivery projects.

   •    

Nasdaq introduced artificial intelligence capabilities to improve surveillance patterns on the U.S. stock market. Nasdaq, through a collaboration of its Market Technology business and U.S. market surveillance unit, launched the use of artificial intelligence for surveillance patterns on The Nasdaq Stock Market, the world’s largest stock exchange by volume traded. The initiative enhances Nasdaq’s market surveillance functionality to improve detection of malicious activity. Over time, our Market Technology business expects to offer these new detection capabilities for surveillance to its exchange and regulator customers as well as its banks and broker customers.

Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) for a given period is the annualized revenue of active Market Technology support and SaaS subscription contracts. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.

NON-GAAP INFORMATION  

In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Nasdaq also discloses certain non-GAAP results of operations, including, but not limited to, net income attributable to Nasdaq, diluted earnings per share, operating income, and operating expenses, that include certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are described in the reconciliation table of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP information provided at the end of this release. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with U.S. GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance.  

These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone.  

We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating expenses to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance.  

Foreign exchange impact: In countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this release isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period’s results by the prior period’s exchange rates.

We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Intangible asset amortization expense can vary from period to period due to episodic acquisitions completed, rather than from our ongoing business operations.  

 (2)  

We have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and divestitures in recent years which have resulted in expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred. These expenses generally include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third party transaction costs and will vary based on the size and frequency of the activities described above.

In September 2019, we initiated the transition of certain technology platforms to advance the company’s strategic opportunities as a technology and analytics provider and continue the realignment of certain business areas. Charges associated with this plan represent a fundamental shift in our strategy and technology as well as executive re-alignment and will be excluded for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures as they are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq’s performance between periods. For the three months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $9 million in charges primarily related to severance and employee-related costs. For the three months ended September 30, 2019, we recorded $30 million in charges primarily related to asset impairment charges mainly related to capitalized software that was retired.  

 (4)  

In the relevant periods, primarily represents net income recognized from our equity interest in OCC. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily represents additional income recognized in 2019 due to the timing of information received from the OCC. In February 2019, due to the SEC disapproval of the OCC rule change that established OCC’s 2015 capital plan, OCC suspended customer rebates and dividends to owners. We were not able to determine the impact of the disapproval of the OCC capital plan on OCC’s 2018 net income until March 2019, when OCC’s 2018 financial statements were made available to us. As a result, in March 2019, we recognized an additional $36 million of income relating to our share of OCC’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2018. We also recognized our share of OCC’s net income of $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We will continue to exclude net income related to our share of OCC’s earnings for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures as our income on this investment will vary significantly compared to prior years. This will provide a more meaningful analysis of Nasdaq’s ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq’s performance between periods.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Annualized Recurring Revenue, or ARR, for a given period is the annualized revenue of Market Technology support and SaaS subscription contracts. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts during the reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.
