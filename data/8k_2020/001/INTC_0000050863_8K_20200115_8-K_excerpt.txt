Election of Director.   

On January 15, 2020, the Board of Directors (“Board”) of Intel Corporation (“Intel”) elected Ms. Alyssa Henry to the Board, effective immediately. The Board determined that Ms. Henry qualifies as “independent” in accordance with the published listing requirements of Nasdaq. Ms. Henry has not been appointed to any Board committees at this time.  

Ms. Henry, 49, has served as Seller Lead for Square, Inc. — a provider of software, hardware and financial services for small businesses and individuals — since 2014. She oversees global engineering, product management, design, sales, marketing, partnerships and support for Square’s seller-facing software and financial services products. Prior to Square, she served in various positions with Amazon.com, Inc. from 2006 to 2014, including as vice president of Amazon Web Services Storage Services, where she led services including Amazon S3, Amazon EBS and Amazon Lambda; and as Amazon’s director of software development for ordering, with responsibility for Amazon’s ordering workflow software and databases. Before Amazon, Ms. Henry spent 12 years at Microsoft Corporation working on databases and data access technologies in a variety of engineering, program management and product unit management roles. Ms. Henry started her career as a developer in the financial services industry. She has served as a member of the board of directors of Unity Technologies, a privately held company, since December 2018.  

Ms. Henry will receive the standard compensation amounts payable to non-employee directors of the Board. Pursuant to these arrangements, commencing in January 2020, Ms. Henry will be paid an annual cash retainer of $90,000 (in addition to any committee fees), which will be pro-rated for her first year of service. In addition, in the first quarter of 2020, Ms. Henry will be granted non-employee director time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with a value on the grant date of approximately $91,667, which is pro-rated from the value of the annual award granted to non-employee  directors. The award will vest on the earlier of May 16, 2020 and the date of Intel’s 2020 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, the same schedule as the annual award granted to the non-employee directors in May 2019, subject to Ms. Henry’s continued service on the Board.  

Ms. Henry will also enter into Intel’s standard form of directors’ indemnification agreement with Intel, pursuant to which Intel agrees to indemnify its directors to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and subject to certain conditions to advance expenses in connection with proceedings as described in the indemnification agreement.
