[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Adjusted operating income and adjusted net income per share attributable to Tyson, or Adjusted EPS, are non-GAAP financial measures and are explained and reconciled to a comparable GAAP measure at the end of this release. Adjusted net income per share attributable to Tyson guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis because certain information necessary to calculate such measure on a GAAP basis is unavailable, dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the Company. A further explanation of providing non-GAAP guidance is included at the end of this release. 

First Quarter Highlights 

•GAAP EPS of $1.52, up 1% from prior year; Adjusted EPS of $1.66, up 5% from prior year

•GAAP operating income of $826 million, up 2% from prior year

•Adjusted operating income of $894 million, up 6% from prior year

•Total Company GAAP operating margin of 7.6%; Adjusted operating margin of 8.3%

•Record Beef GAAP operating margin of 10.7% and record Adjusted operating margin of 11.2%

•Sales growth of 6%

“Our overall results in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were in line with expectations,” said Noel White, Tyson Foods’ CEO. “Our Beef and Pork segments performed well as the effects of African swine fever are beginning to materialize. Our Chicken segment performed better operationally, although in a soft pricing environment. Our Prepared Foods segment produced its sixth consecutive quarter of retail consumption growth, demonstrating the strength of our brands and innovation as we grew or held market share in all core categories.

“With improved access to global markets resulting from recent trade developments, there are reasons to be optimistic about fiscal 2020 and beyond and we are well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the global marketplace. Although we anticipate the challenges and volatility typical in our second fiscal quarter, our long-term outlook remains positive.”

Note: Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure and is explained and reconciled to a comparable GAAP measure at the end of this release.

Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are presented as supplementary measures in the evaluation of our business that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We use adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin as internal performance measurements and as two criteria for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers. We believe adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are meaningful to our investors to enhance their understanding of our financial performance and are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to compare our performance with the performance of other companies that report adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. Further, we believe that adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are useful measures because they improve comparability of results of operations from period to period. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin should not be considered as substitutes for operating income, operating margin or any other measure of operating performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Investors should rely primarily on our GAAP results and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally in making investment decisions. Our calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Summary of Segment Results

•Beef - Sales volume decreased due to a reduction in live cattle harvest capacity as a result of a fire that caused the temporary closure of a production facility for the majority of the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Average sales price increased as beef demand remained strong. Operating income increased as we continued to maximize our revenues relative to live fed cattle costs, partially offset by increased operating costs and $16 million of net incremental costs from a production facility fire.

•Pork - Sales volume increased due to increased domestic availability of live hogs and strong demand for our pork products. Average sales price increased associated with higher livestock costs and stronger export markets. Operating income increased as we maximized our revenues relative to the live hog markets, partially attributable to favorable export markets and improved operational performance, which were slightly offset by higher operating costs. 

•Chicken - Sales volume increased primarily due to incremental volume from a business acquisition, partially offset by lower volume from our rendering and blending business. Average sales price increased due to lower rendering and blending sales, which carry a lower average sales price, largely offset by broadly weaker chicken pricing as a result of market conditions. Operating income decreased primarily from challenging pricing conditions. Additionally, operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was impacted by $21 million in restructuring costs.

•Prepared Foods - Sales volume decreased as growth in volume across the consumer products business was offset by other intersegment sales channel shifts. Average sales price increased due to favorable product mix and the pass through of increased raw material costs. Operating income decreased primarily due to increased operating costs, including an $80 million increase in raw material costs. Additionally, operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was impacted by $22 million in restructuring costs.

Outlook

For fiscal 2020, USDA indicates domestic protein production (beef, pork, chicken and turkey) should increase approximately 3-4% from fiscal 2019 levels, but we expect export markets to absorb the increased production. The following is a summary of the outlook for each of our segments, as well as an outlook for capital expenditures, net interest expense, liquidity and tax rate for fiscal 2020. While our accounting cycle results in a 53-week year in fiscal 2020 as compared to a 52-week year in fiscal 2019, the fiscal 2020 outlook is based on a comparable 52-week year.

Adjusted operating margin guidance is provided below on a non-GAAP basis2. 

•Beef – We expect industry fed cattle supplies to increase approximately 1% in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. We expect ample supplies in regions where we operate our plants. For fiscal 2020, we believe our Beef segment's adjusted operating margin will be toward the upper end of 6.5% to 7.5%, absent additional impacts from ASF.

•Pork – We expect industry hog supplies to increase approximately 4% in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. We expect increased livestock costs in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2020, we believe our Pork segment's adjusted operating margin will be 6% to 8%, absent additional impacts from ASF.

•Chicken – USDA projects a 4% increase in chicken production in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2020, we believe our Chicken segment's adjusted operating margin will be 4% to 6%, absent additional impacts from ASF.

•Prepared Foods – We expect raw material costs to increase throughout fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019, but we expect to recover these costs through pricing over time. Given the timing lag on passing these prices through, we may not fully recover these costs within the fiscal year. For fiscal 2020, we believe our Prepared Foods segment's adjusted operating margin will be 10% to 12%.

•International/Other – International/Other primarily includes our foreign operations in Asia-Pacific, China-Korea and Europe, third-party merger and integration costs and corporate overhead related to Tyson New Ventures, LLC. We expect improved results in fiscal 2020 from improvement in our foreign operations as well as the impact of a full year of our recently acquired operations.

•Capital Expenditures – For fiscal 2020, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion. Capital expenditures will include spending for production growth, safety, animal well-being, infrastructure replacements and upgrades, and operational improvements that are expected to result in production and labor efficiencies, yield improvements and sales channel flexibility. 

•Net Interest Expense – We expect net interest expense to approximate $450 million for fiscal 2020. 

•Liquidity – We expect total liquidity, which was approximately $1.4 billion at December 28, 2019, to remain above our minimum liquidity target of $1.0 billion.

•Tax Rate – We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 23.5% in fiscal 2020.

2The Company is not able to reconcile its full-year fiscal 2020 adjusted operating margin guidance to its fiscal 2020 projected GAAP operating margin guidance because certain information necessary to calculate such measure on a GAAP basis is unavailable or dependent on the timing of future events outside of our control. Therefore, because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature of the amount of future adjustments, which could be significant, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of this measure without unreasonable effort. Adjusted operating margin should not be considered a substitute for operating margin or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Investors should rely primarily on the Company’s GAAP results and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally in making investment decisions.

(c)The fiscal year ended September 28, 2019 included a $41 million impairment associated with the planned divestiture of a business. 

EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Net debt to EBITDA (Adjusted EBITDA) represents the ratio of our debt, net of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, net debt to EBITDA and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA are presented as supplemental financial measurements in the evaluation of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is a tool intended to assist our management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations on an ongoing basis.

We believe the presentation of these financial measures helps management and investors to assess our operating performance from period to period, including our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt, enhances understanding of our financial performance and highlights operational trends. These measures are widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies; however, the measurements of EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) and net debt to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA) may not be comparable to those of other companies, which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures. EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) and net debt to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA) are not measures required by or calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered as substitutes for net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of operating cash flow or liquidity. EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) is a useful tool for assessing, but is not a reliable indicator of, our ability to generate cash to service our debt obligations because certain of the items added to net income to determine EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) involve outlays of cash. As a result, actual cash available to service our debt obligations will be different from EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA). Investors should rely primarily on our GAAP results and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally in making investment decisions.

We believe Adjusted EPS is meaningful to our investors to enhance their understanding of our financial performance and is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to compare our performance with the performance of other companies that report Adjusted EPS.
