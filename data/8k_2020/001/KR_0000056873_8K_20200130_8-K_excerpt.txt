 Item 7.01Regulation FD Disclosure.  

In response to investor inquiries regarding the Lucky’s Market decision to commence a voluntary proceeding in the Delaware bankruptcy court on Monday, January 27, 2019, Kroger issued the following statement: 

As Kroger disclosed in its third quarter earnings announcement, as a result of a portfolio review, we made the decision to divest our interest in Lucky’s Market. Given this decision to divest, we recognized an impairment charge of $238 million in the third quarter of 2019. The portion of this charge attributable to Kroger was $131 million. The impairment charge was a non-cash charge and reflects the write-down of our initial investment in Lucky's Market as well as additional funding provided to operate and grow the business. As a result of the Lucky’s bankruptcy proceedings, we expect to deconsolidate Lucky’s from our consolidated financial statements which will result in a non-cash charge for GAAP purposes in the fourth quarter of 2019. We do not expect any incremental impact on adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal years 2019 or 2020 as a result of the bankruptcy proceeding.
