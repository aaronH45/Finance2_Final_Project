“We marked another year of top quartile financial performance in 2019 with 6 percent revenue growth, 14 percent EPS growth and free cash flow of 118 percent of net earnings, successfully navigating a rapidly evolving global economic and geopolitical landscape,” said Michael W. Lamach, chairman and chief executive officer of Ingersoll Rand. “Our highly engaged team consistently executed our strategy focused on global energy efficiency and sustainability mega trends to deliver strong and differentiated results for our customers and shareholders. 

While we grew in all of our Climate businesses, our Commercial HVAC business growth was truly outstanding, with high-single digit percentage growth globally and low-teens percentage growth in North America. It was a challenging year for our Industrial businesses with a decline in short cycle industrial spending globally; however, our team ended 2019 with better than expected fourth quarter revenues and operating income.” 

Lamach continued, “Our businesses are well-positioned as we progress toward the close of the Reverse Morris Trust transaction with Gardner Denver, and the establishment of a pure-play global leader in climate technologies along with a global leader in mission-critical flow creation and industrial solutions. We’re excited about the potential for both companies to unlock value for shareholders.

Looking at 2020 and the new Trane Technologies, we remain confident that we have the fundamental ingredients for another year of strong financial performance. We’ve entered the year with broadly favorable end markets, strong backlog and a proven business operating system that enables us to continue navigating ongoing global uncertainties, drive strong earnings per share growth and deliver powerful cash flow to execute our balanced capital allocation strategy.”

Highlights from the Fourth Quarter of 2019 (all comparisons against the fourth quarter of 2018 unless otherwise noted)

•Strong enterprise reported revenue growth in both segments led by exceptional growth in the Climate segment's North America Commercial HVAC business, up high-teens.

•Enterprise reported bookings were down 4 percent and organic bookings were down 6 percent. However, organic bookings were up high-single digits excluding the Transport business, which has faced very difficult comparisons throughout 2019 given the exceptional North American trailer and auxiliary power unit growth in 2018. High-single digit enterprise organic bookings growth also excludes the impact of the company's previously disclosed large Commercial HVAC order of approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.

•GAAP operating margin down 130 basis points; adjusted operating margin up 10 basis points. Fourth quarter operating leverage was lower than company expectations driven by three primary impacts: 1) gross margin de-leverage associated with the high-single digit revenue decline in the Transport business, 2) increased incentive compensation tied to the company significantly exceeding its free cash flow generation expectations in the fourth quarter, and 3) unplanned year-end inventory adjustments in the Climate segment.

•GAAP continuing EPS was up 12 percent. Adjusted continuing EPS growth was up 6 percent compounding on 29 percent growth in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Fourth-Quarter Business Review (all comparisons against the fourth quarter of 2018 unless otherwise noted)

Climate Segment: delivers energy-efficient products and innovative energy services. The segment includes Trane® and American Standard® Heating & Air Conditioning which provide heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and commercial and residential building services, parts, support and controls; energy services and building automation through Trane Building Advantage™ and Nexia™; and Thermo King® transport temperature control solutions.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The Climate segment delivered strong reported and organic revenue growth, up 6 percent and 7 percent, respectively, compounding on a tough comparison of 9 percent organic growth in the prior year. 

•Underlying Climate bookings continued to be very strong in the quarter. Climate reported bookings were down 7 percent and organic bookings were down 6 percent. However, organic bookings were up low-teens excluding the Transport business and the aforementioned 4Q18 large Commercial HVAC order.

•Climate reported operating margin was down 40 basis points and adjusted operating margin was down 30 basis points. Operating leverage in the fourth quarter was below company expectations, impacted by the three factors outlined in the fourth quarter highlights section above.

Industrial Segment: delivers products and services that enhance energy efficiency, productivity and operations. The segment includes compressed air and gas systems and services, power tools, material handling systems, fluid management systems, as well as Club Car® golf, utility and consumer low-speed vehicles.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Bookings were up 6 percent and revenues were up 8 percent. Organic bookings were down 4 percent and organic revenues were down 2 percent. Solid organic bookings and revenue growth in Small Electric Vehicles was more than offset by continued softness for short-cycle equipment driven by lower short-cycle investment spending. 

•GAAP operating margin up 230 basis points; adjusted operating margin up 240 basis points. The company's restructuring efforts, footprint optimization and execution of commercial strategies are delivering strong margin improvement and a more resilient business for the long term.

•GAAP operating margin flat; adjusted operating margin up 70 basis points with 24 percent operating leverage, in-line with company's leverage target.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The company delivered high quality earnings and exceptional free cash flow of $1.8 billion, or 118 percent of adjusted net earnings.

•The company remains on track to complete its proposed Reverse Morris Trust transaction in early 2020 to combine the Industrial segment with Gardner Denver, creating a global leader in mission-critical flow creation and industrial solutions. The transaction will simultaneously create a pure-play global leader in climate technologies for buildings, homes and transportation, named Trane Technologies plc**.
