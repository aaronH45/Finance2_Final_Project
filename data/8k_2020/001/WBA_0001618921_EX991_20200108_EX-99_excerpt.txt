Business Divisions  

Retail Pharmacy USA:  

Retail Pharmacy USA had first quarter sales of $26.1 billion, an increase of 1.6 percent over the year-ago quarter. Sales in comparable stores increased by the same percentage.  

Pharmacy sales increased 2.9 percent compared with the year-ago quarter, reflecting higher brand inflation and prescription volume, and strong growth in central specialty. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 2.5 percent. The division filled 294.0 million prescriptions, including immunizations, adjusted to 30-day equivalents in the quarter, an increase of 1.4 percent over the year-ago quarter. Prescriptions filled in comparable stores increased 2.8 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago.  

The division’s retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis in the first quarter decreased approximately 55 basis points over the year-ago quarter to 20.9 percent, which was in line with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, as reported by IQVIA.3 The year-over-year change includes the impact of the store optimization program.  

Retail sales decreased 2.2 percent in the first quarter compared with the year-ago period. Comparable retail sales were down 0.5 percent in the quarter, mostly due to continued de-emphasis of tobacco. Excluding tobacco and e-cigarettes, comparable retail sales increased around 0.8 percent, reflecting solid growth in the core health and wellness and beauty categories.  

2   

Gross profit decreased 5.2 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago and adjusted gross profit decreased 4.9 percent, with procurement savings and pharmacy prescription growth insufficient to offset year-on-year reimbursement pressure.  

First quarter selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) as a percentage of sales decreased by 0.3 percentage point compared with the year-ago quarter. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased by 0.6 percentage point in the same period. Both decreases reflect strong cost savings, which more than offset incremental investments, impact of inflation and higher year-on-year bonus impact.  

Operating income in the first quarter decreased 27.3 percent from the year-ago quarter to $848 million. Excluding costs related to the acquisition of Rite Aid stores and to the Transformational Cost Management Program, adjusted operating income in the first quarter decreased 16.2 percent from the year-ago quarter to $1.2 billion.  

Retail Pharmacy International:  

Retail Pharmacy International had first quarter sales of $2.7 billion, a decrease of 5.4 percent from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an adverse currency impact of 2.7 percent. Sales decreased 2.7 percent on a constant currency basis, mainly due to lower retail sales in Boots UK and lower sales in Chile, reflecting social unrest.  

Comparable pharmacy sales increased 0.6 percent on a constant currency basis, primarily due to the UK, driven by higher National Health Service (NHS) reimbursement and increased sales of services, partially offset by lower prescription volume. Comparable retail sales decreased 3.0 percent on a constant currency basis, with Boots UK holding share in a declining market.  

Gross profit decreased 6.3 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago, including an adverse currency impact of 2.6 percent. On a constant currency basis, gross profit and adjusted gross profit decreased 3.7 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively, reflecting lower retail sales and margin in Boots UK.  

SG&A as a percentage of sales increased 0.7 percentage point and adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales, on a constant currency basis, increased 1.3 percentage points, both reflecting higher year-on-year bonus impact and technology investments.  

Operating income in the first quarter decreased 43.7 percent from the year-ago quarter to $44 million, while adjusted operating income decreased 40.5 percent to $79 million, down 39.1 percent on a constant currency basis.  

Pharmaceutical Wholesale:  

Pharmaceutical Wholesale had first quarter sales of $6.0 billion, an increase of 5.2 percent from the year-ago quarter, including an adverse currency impact of 3.0 percent. On a constant currency basis, comparable sales increased 8.3 percent, led by emerging markets and the UK, including a customer contract change in the UK.  

Operating income in the first quarter was $122 million, which included $13 million from the company’s equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. This compared with operating income of $155 million in the year-ago quarter, which included $39 million from the company’s equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen.  

Adjusted operating income increased 4.1 percent to $229 million, up 4.9 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong revenue growth and higher contribution from AmerisourceBergen.  

Dividends Declared  

During the first quarter, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 45.75 cents per share, unchanged from the previous quarter and an increase of 4 percent from the year-ago quarter. The dividend was payable December 12, 2019 to stockholders of record as of November 18, 2019.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)  

REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(in millions, except per share amounts)  

The following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under SEC rules, presented in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures in the press release, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  

These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the company’s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believe that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the company’s business from period to period and trends in the company’s historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release. The company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis (including the information under “Company Outlook” above) where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.  

Constant currency  

The company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the United States reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and this presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  

Comparable sales  

For the company’s Retail Pharmacy divisions, comparable stores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster in the past twelve months. Relocated stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable store sales, comparable pharmacy sales and comparable retail sales refer to total sales, pharmacy sales and retail sales, respectively, in such stores. For the Retail Pharmacy USA division, comparable numbers of prescriptions refer to number of prescriptions in such stores. For the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, comparable sales are defined as sales excluding acquisitions and dispositions. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, the company’s method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.  

10   

With respect to the Retail Pharmacy Internal division, comparable store sales, comparable pharmacy sales and comparable retail sales, and with respect to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, comparable sales, are presented on a constant currency basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the discussion above in “Constant currency” for further details on constant currency calculations.

Represents the adjustment to the GAAP basis tax provision commensurate with non-GAAP adjustments and the adjusted tax rate true-up.

Beginning in the quarter ended May 31, 2019, management reviewed and refined its practice to reflect the proportionate share of certain equity method investees’ non-cash items or unusual or infrequent items consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP measures in order to provide investors with a comparable view of performance across periods. These adjustments include acquisition-related amortization and acquisition-related costs and were immaterial for the prior periods presented. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees.

FREE CASH FLOW  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1  

Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities in a period less additions to property, plant and equipment (capital expenditures) made in that period. This measure does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures as the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments for future business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statements of cash flows.
