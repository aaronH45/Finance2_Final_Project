SUMMARY OF FULL YEAR AND FOURTH QUARTER 2019 RESULTS:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Based on income taxes at an approximate 25% incremental rate. 

During the fourth quarter of 2019, total revenue increased approximately 3 percent on a reported and adjusted basis(1) compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 as growth in non-interest income exceeded a decline in net interest income. Non-interest expense remained well controlled during the quarter on a reported and adjusted basis(1), as higher production-based compensation and marketing spend were partially offset by a reduction in occupancy expense. 

Overall asset quality remained in line with the company's broader risk expectations during the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, annualized net charge-offs remained unchanged at 0.46 percent of average loans, and total non-performing loans increased 1 basis point to 0.61 percent of total loans outstanding. The allowance for loan and lease losses increased to 1.05 percent of total loans and 171 percent of non-performing loans.

Business services criticized loans increased 17 percent driven by increases in classified loans, partially offset by a decrease in special mention loans.

Non-GAAP adjusted items(1) impacting the company's earnings are identified to assist investors in analyzing Regions' operating results on the same basis as that applied by management and provide a basis to predict future performance. Non-GAAP adjusted items(1) in the current quarter include the company's continued focus on increasing organizational efficiency and effectiveness. This included $12 million of net expenses associated with branch consolidations and property and equipment charges. In addition, the company incurred a $16 million loss related to the early extinguishment of debt and recorded $2 million in securities losses during the quarter.

Comparison of fourth quarter 2019 to third quarter 2019

Total revenue of approximately $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter decreased 1 percent on a reported and adjusted basis(1) compared to the prior quarter. Net interest income and other financing income decreased 2 percent and net interest margin decreased 5 basis points to 3.39 percent. Net interest margin and net interest income and other financing income were negatively impacted primarily by lower market interest rates, partially offset by declining deposit costs and a more favorable funding mix. Lower average loan balances also reduced net interest income and other financing income but benefited net interest margin.

Non-interest income increased approximately 1 percent on a reported and adjusted basis(1) led by growth in capital markets, wealth management and service charges. Capital markets experienced a record quarter driven by higher commercial swap income, loan syndication revenue, and merger and acquisition advisory services. Customer interest rate swap income was impacted by $5 million of positive market-related credit valuation adjustments during the fourth quarter, compared to $6 million of negative valuation adjustments during the prior quarter. The increase in capital markets income was partially offset by declines in mortgage income and other non-interest income. The decrease in mortgage income was driven primarily by less favorable hedging and valuation adjustments on residential mortgage servicing rights. The decrease in other non-interest income was driven primarily by a net $11 million increase in the value of certain equity investments during the prior quarter that did not repeat at the same level. 

Comparison of fourth quarter 2019 to fourth quarter 2018

Total revenue increased 3 percent on a reported and adjusted basis(1) compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Net interest income and other financing income decreased 4 percent, while net interest margin decreased 13 basis points. Net interest margin and net interest income and other financing income were negatively impacted by lower market interest rates and higher funding costs. This was partially offset by the positive impacts from repositioning strategies executed in the investment portfolio throughout 2019, higher loan balances and favorable loan remixing. 

Non-interest income increased 17 percent on a reported and adjusted basis(1). Market volatility in the fourth quarter of 2018 drove significant valuation declines in assets held for employee benefits and negatively impacted bank-owned life insurance income. Compared to the prior-year quarter, market value adjustments on total employee benefit assets increased $22 million, and favorably impacted bank-owned life insurance income $5 million. Wealth management income increased 9 percent reflecting growth in both investment services and investment management and trust income which includes the 2019 acquisition of Highland Associates, Inc. Mortgage income increased 63 percent driven primarily by increased production and sales income reflecting a 61 percent increase in total mortgage production. Hedging and valuation adjustments on residential mortgage servicing rights also contributed to the increase. Capital markets income increased 22 percent due primarily to higher customer interest rate swap income, loan syndication revenue, and an increase in fees generated from the

placement of permanent financing for real estate customers. The increase in swap income was driven primarily by market-related credit valuation adjustments tied to customer derivatives. 

Non-interest expense from continuing operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NM - Not Meaningful

Comparison of fourth quarter 2019 to third quarter 2019

Non-interest expense increased 3 percent on a reported basis but remained relatively unchanged on an adjusted basis(1) compared to the third quarter. Higher production-based incentives drove a 1 percent increase in salaries and benefits. Professional fees increased 33 percent driven by the timing of legal and consulting costs, and marketing expenses increased 22 percent driven by additional campaigns targeting priority markets. Partially offsetting these increases, outside services decreased 8 percent reflecting the company's success in reducing overall third-party spend. 

The company's fourth quarter efficiency ratio was 60.1 percent on a reported basis and 58.1 percent on an adjusted basis(1). The effective tax rate was approximately 20.3 percent.

Comparison of fourth quarter 2019 to fourth quarter 2018

Non-interest expense increased 5 percent on a reported basis and 3 percent on an adjusted basis(1) compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Salaries and benefits increased 4 percent driven primarily by an increase in production-based incentives, partially offset by continued staffing reductions. Staffing levels declined 2 percent or 405 full-time equivalent positions from the fourth quarter of 2018. Marketing expenses increased 33 percent as additional targeted campaigns commenced during the current quarter. 

Occupancy expense decreased 8 percent driven primarily by storm-related charges associated with Hurricane Michael recorded in the prior year period, combined with the targeted reduction of approximately 650,000 square feet of space in 2019.

Comparison of fourth quarter 2019 to third quarter 2019

Average loans and leases decreased approximately 1 percent on a reported basis and remained relatively unchanged on an adjusted basis(1) compared to the prior quarter. Average balances in the business lending portfolio decreased modestly reflecting a continued focus on client selectivity and overall relationship profitability. Business lending loans were also impacted by lower line utilization as payoffs and paydowns outpaced production. Adjusted(1) average balances in the consumer lending portfolio increased modestly as growth in residential first mortgage, indirect-other consumer and consumer credit card was partially offset by declines in home equity lending. 

Comparison of fourth quarter 2019 to fourth quarter 2018

Average loans and leases increased 1 percent on a reported basis and 2 percent on an adjusted basis(1) compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted(1) average balances in the business lending portfolio increased 3 percent led by 4 percent adjusted(1) growth in commercial and industrial loans. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans declined 6 percent, while investor real estate loans increased 5 percent. Adjusted(1) average balances in the consumer lending portfolio increased modestly as growth in indirect-other consumer, residential first mortgage, consumer credit card, and other consumer loans was partially offset by declines in home equity lending.

Deposits 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Comparison of fourth quarter 2019 to third quarter 2019

Total average deposit balances remained relatively stable at $94.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Average deposits were relatively unchanged in the Consumer segment while the Corporate and Wealth Management segments experienced increases of 4 percent and 1 percent, respectively. The increase in Corporate segment deposits was primarily driven by seasonally higher non-interest bearing and money market balances. Average deposits in the Other segment deposits decreased 51 percent primarily within the wholesale corporate treasury deposit categories. 

Comparison of fourth quarter 2019 to fourth quarter 2018

Total average deposit balances increased 1 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 as reductions in low-cost deposits, particularly non-interest-bearing deposits, were offset by growth in time and money market deposits. Solid growth in average Consumer segment deposits was partially offset by reductions in Other segment deposits. Corporate and Wealth segment deposits remained relatively stable. Within the Consumer segment, steady growth in primary operating accounts contributed to a 3 percent increase in average non-interest-bearing deposits, helping to reduce the impact of deposit remixing within the other segments.

Asset quality

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Excludes guaranteed residential first mortgages that are 90+ days past due and still accruing. 

** Business services represents the combined total of commercial and investor real estate loans.

Comparison of fourth quarter 2019 to third quarter 2019

Asset quality performed in line with the company's broader risk expectations reflecting improvements in several credit metrics and some continued normalization of others. Total business services criticized and classified loans decreased 3 percent and 8 percent, respectively, while troubled debt restructured loans and delinquent loans, excluding government guaranteed mortgages, remained stable. Total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased 5 basis points to 0.61 percent of loans outstanding. The increase in non-accrual loans was primarily attributable to one credit within the waste management industry. Annualized net charge-offs increased modestly to 0.46 percent of average loans. The provision for loan losses equaled net charge-offs resulting in an allowance for loan losses equal to 1.05 percent of total loans outstanding and 171 percent of total non-accrual loans. While overall asset quality remains within expectations, volatility in certain credit metrics can be expected.

Comparison of fourth quarter 2019 to fourth quarter 2018

Annualized net charge-offs were in line with the fourth quarter of 2018, and the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans increased 4 basis points. Total non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased 1 basis point as a percent of loans outstanding. Total business services criticized loans increased 17 percent driven primarily by an increase in classified loans, partially offset by a reduction in special mention loans. In addition, total troubled debt restructured loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased 10 percent driven primarily by reductions in commercial loans.

Capital and liquidity

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* 2019 improvement in tangible common book value per share includes the impact of quarterly earnings, as well as improvement to market value adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income, offset by continued capital returns.

Regions’ estimated capital ratios remain well above current regulatory requirements under the Basel III capital rules. The Tier 1(2) and Common Equity Tier 1(2) ratios were estimated at 10.8 percent and 9.6 percent, respectively, at quarter-end.

Use of non-GAAP financial measures

Management uses pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP) and adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP), as well as the adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) and the adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP) to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the fee income ratio. Adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) and adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP) are used to determine adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP). Net interest income and other financing income (GAAP) on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the fee income and efficiency ratios. Regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions’ business. It is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur; however, management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.

Tangible common stockholders’ equity ratios have become a focus of some investors and management believes they may assist investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions’ capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders’ equity measure. Because tangible common stockholders’ equity is not formally defined by GAAP or prescribed in any amount by federal banking regulations it is currently considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions’ disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions’ capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders’ equity, management believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions’ capital adequacy on this same basis.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders.

Management and the Board of Directors utilize non-GAAP measures as follows:

•Preparation of Regions' operating budgets

12

•Monthly financial performance reporting

•Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)

•Presentation to investors of company performance
