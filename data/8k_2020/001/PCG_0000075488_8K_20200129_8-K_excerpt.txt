Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. 

As previously disclosed, PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the “Utility”) are party to a Senior Secured Superpriority Debtor-in-Possession Credit, Guaranty and Security Agreement, dated as of February 1, 2019 (the “DIP Credit Agreement”), among the Utility, as borrower, PG&E Corporation, as guarantor, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Citibank, N.A., as collateral agent, and the lenders and issuing banks party thereto. The DIP Credit Agreement provides for an aggregate of $5.5 billion in senior secured superpriority debtor-in-possession credit facilities, which include a delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the “DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. 

On January 29, 2020, in light of the fact that the commitments under the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility would have expired at the close of the business day, the Utility borrowed the full $500 million thereunder. No additional amounts are available under the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility. 

The proceeds of the borrowings under the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

Any description of PG&E Corporation’s or the Utility’s respective credit agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the information provided in their Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 1, 2019 and the complete copies of the DIP Credit Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 thereto, which are incorporated herein by reference.
