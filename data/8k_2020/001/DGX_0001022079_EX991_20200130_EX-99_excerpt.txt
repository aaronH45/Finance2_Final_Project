•Full year 2020 reported diluted EPS expected to be greater than $5.51, and adjusted diluted EPS to be greater than $6.60 

SECAUCUS, N.J., January 30, 2020 - Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE: DGX), the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services, announced today financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2019.

"We had a solid fourth quarter and ended the year by delivering record revenues, earnings and cash from operations,” said Steve Rusckowski, Chairman, CEO and President. “Strong volume growth from expanded health plan network access, combined with outstanding execution of our Operational Excellence strategy, helped us offset significant reimbursement pressure. 

“Quest is well positioned once again in 2020 to deliver on our commitment to grow revenues and earnings. We have a strong value proposition that supports health care's triple aim of improving medical quality and the patient experience while reducing the cost of care. Our guidance for 2020 reflects our continued momentum, partially offset by yet another year of meaningful reimbursement pressure."

Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures

As used in this press release the term “reported” refers to measures under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The term “adjusted” refers to non-GAAP operating performance measures that exclude special items such as restructuring and integration charges, amortization expense, excess tax benefits ("ETB") associated with stock-based compensation, the gain associated with the sale and leaseback of a property, and other items.

Non-GAAP adjusted measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to GAAP results. Non-GAAP adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under GAAP. Management may use these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and analysts to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, as well as to analyze the underlying trends in our business and to assess our performance. The additional tables attached below include reconciliations of non-GAAP adjusted measures to GAAP measures.

(a)For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, represents costs primarily associated with systems conversions and integration incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, represents costs primarily associated with workforce reductions, systems conversions and integration incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business. The following table summarizes the pre-tax impact of restructuring and integration charges on the company's consolidated statements of operations: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(b)For the three months ended December 31, 2019, primarily represents a gain associated with the sale and leaseback of a property. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the pre-tax impact primarily represents a gain associated with the sale and leaseback of a property, a gain associated with the decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration accruals associated with previous acquisitions, and a gain associated with an insurance claim for hurricane related losses, partially offset by costs incurred related to a data security incident and non-cash asset impairment charges.

For the three months ended December 31, 2018, primarily represents the loss on the sale of a foreign subsidiary. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, primarily represents costs incurred related to certain legal matters and a loss on the sale of a foreign subsidiary, which were partially offset by a gain associated with the decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration accrual associated with a previous acquisition and an insurance claim for hurricane related losses.

The following table summarizes the pre-tax impact of these other items on the company's consolidated statement of operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(c)For restructuring and integration charges, other items and amortization expense, income tax impacts, where recorded, were primarily calculated using combined statutory income tax rates of 25.5% for both 2019 and 2018. For the gain associated with an insurance claim for hurricane related losses in 2019, there was no net income tax expense as the company is able to utilize net operating loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had previously been established. For the gain in 2019 associated with the decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration accruals associated with previous acquisitions, there was no net income tax expense related to acquisitions in which the gain is non-taxable.

(d)For the three months ended December 31, 2018, represents an income tax expense associated with finalizing the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act ("TCJA"). For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, represents an income tax benefit associated with a change in a tax return accounting method that enabled the company to accelerate the deduction of certain expenses on its 2017 tax return at the federal corporate statutory tax rate in effect during 2017, partially offset by an income tax expense associated with finalizing the impact of the enactment of TCJA.

3)Discontinued operations, net of taxes, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 includes discrete tax benefits of $20 million associated with the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies related to Nichols Institute Diagnostics, a test kit manufacturing subsidiary whose operations were discontinued in 2006.

5)The outlook for adjusted diluted EPS represents management’s estimates for the full year 2020 before the impact of special items, including ETB and amortization expense. Further impacts to earnings related to special items may occur throughout 2020. Additionally, the amount of ETB is dependent upon employee stock option exercises and the company's stock price, which are difficult to predict. The following table reconciles our 2020 outlook for adjusted diluted EPS to the corresponding amounts determined under GAAP:

(a)Represents estimated full year pre-tax charges of $100 million primarily associated with systems conversions and integration costs incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business. Income tax benefits were calculated using a combined statutory income tax rate of 25.5%.
