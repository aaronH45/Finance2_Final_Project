Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Elections of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers. 

1. On February 20, 2020, Mr. Todd M. Bluedorn notified Craig Arnold, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, of his intention not to stand for re-election to the Board of Directors at the upcoming Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. He expressed his full support of the Board and management of the Company and emphasized that the decision was based solely on time constraints and other board obligations. 

2.At a meeting held on February 25, 2020, the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors of the registrant (the “Committee”) established corporate performance criteria that will be used to determine the amount of 2020 incentive compensation awards under the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Plan”). Corporate performance criteria are tied to Adjusted Earnings Per Share and Cash Flow Return on Gross Capital metrics. In addition to these quantitative goals, the Committee may also consider other performance factors in determining final awards. These include, but are not limited to, performance versus profit plan goals, performance versus that reported for the Company’s peers, and progress toward the execution of the corporation’s growth strategies. The Plan participants consist of the Executive Officers of Eaton Corporation and approximately 2,800 other salaried employees. At the same meeting, the Committee established 2020 incentive target amounts. The individual incentive targets for the current executive officers who were named in the summary compensation table of the registrant’s 2019 Proxy Statement (the “Named Executive Officers”) range from 100% to 160%. 

At the meeting, the Committee also established individual targets and approved grants for the Company’s long-term performance-based incentive program (“ESIP”) 2020-2022 Award Period. The 2020-2022 Award Period opportunities for the Named Executive Officers took the form of performance share units (“PSUs”) and grants at the target level range from 10,780 PSUs to 50,050 PSUs. The actual number of PSUs earned will depend upon the registrant’s total return to shareholders, assuming reinvestment of dividends (“TSR”), relative to that of a group of 20 peers approved by the Committee at the same meeting. Consistent with historical practices, participants can earn 0% to 200% of the target number of PSUs.
