 Item 1.01  

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.   

On January 15, 2020, Patterson Veterinary Supply, Inc. (the “Originator”) as servicer, a wholly owned subsidiary of Patterson Companies, Inc. (“Patterson”), entered into a Receivables Purchase Agreement (the “Receivables Purchase Agreement”) with (1) PDC Funding Company IV, LLC (“PDC IV”), a special purpose entity that is wholly owned by the Originator, as seller, (2) the Originator, as the initial servicer, (3) the financial institutions and conduits from time to time party thereto and listed therein (collectively, the “Purchasers”), (4) the purchaser agents from time to time party thereto and listed therein, and (5) MUFG Bank, LTD, as agent. In addition, on that same date, the Originator and PDC IV entered into a Receivables Sale Agreement (the “Receivables Sale Agreement”). Together, the Receivables Purchase Agreement and the Receivables Sale Agreement establish the terms and conditions of an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Receivables Securitization Program”) whereby the Originator sells, or contributes in exchange for equity, certain of its trade receivables and certain related rights to payment and obligations of Originator with respect to such receivables and certain related rights (the “Receivables”) to PDC IV, which, in turn, sells the Receivables to Purchasers.  

Pursuant to the Receivables Securitization Program, a portion of the purchase price for the Receivables is paid by the Purchasers in cash and the balance is treated as a deferred purchase price receivable, which is paid as and when payments in respect of the Receivables are collected from account debtors. The purchase price paid by the Purchasers for the Receivables arising under the Receivables Securitization Program will not exceed $60 million outstanding at any time. The Purchasers under the Receivables Securitization Program receive yield on their investments based on a spread over the commercial paper rate for conduit purchasers and the LIBOR rate for bank purchasers, for each day that their investments in the Receivables are outstanding, as well as a fee calculated on the unused portion of the commitments.  

The Receivables Securitization Program contains certain customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including as to the eligibility of the Receivables being sold, as well as customary reserve requirements, Receivables Securitization Program termination events, Originator termination events and servicer defaults. The Receivables Securitization Program termination events permit the Purchasers to terminate the Receivables Purchase Agreement upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including, but not limited to, failure by PDC IV to pay amounts when due, defaults on indebtedness, certain judgments, a change of control, certain events negatively affecting the overall credit quality of transferred Receivables and bankruptcy and insolvency events.  

Originator will act as servicer of the Purchaser Receivables and will receive a fee for its services. Patterson has entered into a performance undertaking pursuant to which it has agreed to guarantee the payment and performance of PDC IV’s obligations under the Receivables Sale Agreement and Originator’s obligations as servicer under the Receivables Purchase Agreement.  

The Receivables Securitization Program terminates on August 21, 2020; provided, however, that such date may be extended from time to time at the discretion of the Purchasers at the request of PDC IV.  

The proceeds from the sale of Receivables pursuant to the Receivables Securitization Program will be used to repay higher interest indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.  

The foregoing description of the Receivables Securitization Program is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the actual terms of the Receivables Purchase Agreement and the Receivables Sale Agreement, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference
