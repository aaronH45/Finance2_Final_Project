4 The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). From time to time, Morgan Stanley may disclose certain “non-GAAP financial measures” in the course of its earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and otherwise. The Securities and Exchange Commission defines a “non-GAAP financial measure” as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial positions, or cash flows that is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude, or include amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by Morgan Stanley are provided as additional information to analysts, investors and other stakeholders in order to provide them with greater transparency about, or an alternative method for assessing our financial condition, operating results, or prospective regulatory capital requirements. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for U.S. GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference and such comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. 

5 Return on average common equity and return on average tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures that the Firm considers useful for analysts, investors and other stakeholders to allow better comparability of period-to-period operating performance and capital adequacy. The calculation of return on average common equity and return on average tangible common equity represents full year net income or annualized net income applicable for the quarter applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively. Tangible common equity, also a non-GAAP financial measure, represents common equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction. 

6 Pre-tax margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Firm considers useful for analysts, investors and other stakeholders to assess operating performance. Pre-tax margin represents income (loss) before taxes divided by net revenues. 

7 Pre-tax income is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Firm considers useful for analysts, investors and other stakeholders to assess operating performance. Pre-tax income represents income (loss) before taxes.

12 Long-term net flows include the Equity, Fixed Income and Alternative/Other asset classes and exclude the Liquidity asset class.

15 Capital ratios are estimates as of the press release date, January 16, 2020. 

16 The Firm’s risk-based capital ratios for purposes of determining regulatory compliance are the lower of the capital ratios computed under the (i) standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk risk-weighted assets (“RWAs”) (the “Standardized Approach”); and (ii) applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (the “Advanced Approach”). At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Firm’s ratios are based on the Standardized Approach. For information on the calculation of regulatory capital and ratios for prior periods, please refer to the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

17 The Tier 1 leverage ratio is a non-risk based capital requirement that measures the Firm’s leverage. Tier 1 leverage ratio utilizes Tier 1 capital as the numerator and average adjusted assets as the denominator. 

18 The Firm must maintain a Tier 1 supplementary leverage ratio of 5% inclusive of a capital buffer of at least 2% in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The Firm’s Supplementary Leverage Ratio utilizes a Tier 1 capital numerator of approximately $73.3 billion and $70.6 billion, and supplementary leverage exposure denominator of approximately $1.16 trillion and $1.09 trillion, for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively.
