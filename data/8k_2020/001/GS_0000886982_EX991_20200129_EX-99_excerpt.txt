Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements Statements about the firm’s target metrics, including its target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, and statements about future operating expense (including future litigation expense), amount and composition of future Assets under Supervision, planned debt issuances, growth of deposits and associated interest expense savings, future geographic location of its employees, and the timing and profitability of its business initiatives, including its launch of new businesses or new activities, its ability to increase its market share in incumbent businesses and its ability to achieve more durable revenues and higher returns from these initiatives, are forward- looking statements, and it is possible that the firm’s actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the targeted results indicated in these statements. Forward looking statements, including those about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio, and expense savings, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its business prospects and are subject to the risk that the firm may be unable to achieve its targets due to, among other things, changes in the firm’s business mix, lower profitability of new business initiatives, increases in technology and other costs to launch and bring new business initiatives to scale, and increases in liquidity requirements. Statements about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding the capital requirements applicable to the firm and are subject to the risk that the firm’s actual capital requirements may be higher than currently anticipated because of, among other factors, changes in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the firm resulting from changes in regulations or the interpretation or application of existing regulations or changes in the nature and composition of the firm’s activities. Statements about the timing and benefits of business and expense savings initiatives, the level and composition of more durable revenues and increases in market share are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its ability to implement these initiatives and may change, possibly materially, from what is currently expected. Due to the inherent uncertainty in these forward-looking statements, investors should not place undue reliance on the firm’s ability to achieve these results. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm’s future business, results and financial condition, see “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. You should also read the cautionary notes on forward-looking statements in our Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2019 and Earnings Results Presentation for the Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2019. For more information regarding non-GAAP financial measures such as ROTE, refer to the footnotes in the Earnings Release and Earnings Presentation for the Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2019 and information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website: www.goldmansachs.com.

Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements Statements about the firm’s target metrics, including its target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, and statements about future operating expense (including future litigation expense), amount and composition of future Assets under Supervision, planned debt issuances, growth of deposits and associated interest expense savings, future geographic location of its employees, and the timing and profitability of its business initiatives, including its launch of new businesses or new activities, its ability to increase its market share in incumbent businesses and its ability to achieve more durable revenues and higher returns from these initiatives, are forward- looking statements, and it is possible that the firm’s actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the targeted results indicated in these statements. Forward looking statements, including those about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio, and expense savings, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its business prospects and are subject to the risk that the firm may be unable to achieve its targets due to, among other things, changes in the firm’s business mix, lower profitability of new business initiatives, increases in technology and other costs to launch and bring new business initiatives to scale, and increases in liquidity requirements. Statements about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding the capital requirements applicable to the firm and are subject to the risk that the firm’s actual capital requirements may be higher than currently anticipated because of, among other factors, changes in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the firm resulting from changes in regulations or the interpretation or application of existing regulations or changes in the nature and composition of the firm’s activities. Statements about the timing and benefits of business and expense savings initiatives, the level and composition of more durable revenues and increases in market share are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its ability to implement these initiatives and may change, possibly materially, from what is currently expected. Due to the inherent uncertainty in these forward-looking statements, investors should not place undue reliance on the firm’s ability to achieve these results.

Longer-term refers to 5+ year time horizon Slide 3, 14: 1. Return on average common shareholders’ equity (ROE) is calculated by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly common shareholders’ equity. Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity (ROTE) is calculated by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly tangible common shareholders’ equity (tangible common shareholders’ equity is calculated as total shareholders’ equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets). Management believes that ROTE is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed internally, and that tangible common shareholders’ equity is meaningful because it is a measure that the firm and investors use to assess capital adequacy. ROTE and tangible common shareholders’ equity are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements Statements about the firm’s target metrics, including its target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, and statements about future operating expense (including future litigation expense), amount and composition of future Assets under Supervision, planned debt issuances, growth of deposits and associated interest expense savings, future geographic location of its employees, and the timing and profitability of its business initiatives, including its launch of new businesses or new activities, its ability to increase its market share in incumbent businesses and its ability to achieve more durable revenues and higher returns from these initiatives, are forward- looking statements, and it is possible that the firm’s actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the targeted results indicated in these statements. Forward looking statements, including those about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio, and expense savings, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its business prospects and are subject to the risk that the firm may be unable to achieve its targets due to, among other things, changes in the firm’s business mix, lower profitability of new business initiatives, increases in technology and other costs to launch and bring new business initiatives to scale, and increases in liquidity requirements. Statements about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding the capital requirements applicable to the firm and are subject to the risk that the firm’s actual capital requirements may be higher than currently anticipated because of, among other factors, changes in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the firm resulting from changes in regulations or the interpretation or application of existing regulations or changes in the nature and composition of the firm’s activities. Statements about the timing and benefits of business and expense savings initiatives, the level and composition of more durable revenues and increases in market share are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its ability to implement these initiatives and may change, possibly materially, from what is currently expected. Due to the inherent uncertainty in these forward-looking statements, investors should not place undue reliance on the firm’s ability to achieve these results.

Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements Statements about the firm’s target metrics, including its target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, and statements about future operating expense (including future litigation expense), amount and composition of future Assets under Supervision, planned debt issuances, growth of deposits and associated interest expense savings, future geographic location of its employees, and the timing and profitability of its business initiatives, including its launch of new businesses or new activities, its ability to increase its market share in incumbent businesses and its ability to achieve more durable revenues and higher returns from these initiatives, are forward- looking statements, and it is possible that the firm’s actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the targeted results indicated in these statements. Forward looking statements, including those about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio, and expense savings, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its business prospects and are subject to the risk that the firm may be unable to achieve its targets due to, among other things, changes in the firm’s business mix, lower profitability of new business initiatives, increases in technology and other costs to launch and bring new business initiatives to scale, and increases in liquidity requirements. Statements about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding the capital requirements applicable to the firm and are subject to the risk that the firm’s actual capital requirements may be higher than currently anticipated because of, among other factors, changes in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the firm resulting from changes in regulations or the interpretation or application of existing regulations or changes in the nature and composition of the firm’s activities. Statements about the timing and benefits of business and expense savings initiatives, the level and composition of more durable revenues and increases in market share are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its ability to implement these initiatives and may change, possibly materially, from what is currently expected. Due to the inherent uncertainty in these forward-looking statements, investors should not place undue reliance on the firm’s ability to achieve these results.

Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements Statements about the firm’s target metrics, including its target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, and statements about future operating expense (including future litigation expense), amount and composition of future Assets under Supervision, planned debt issuances, growth of deposits and associated interest expense savings, future geographic location of its employees, and the timing and profitability of its business initiatives, including its launch of new businesses or new activities, its ability to increase its market share in incumbent businesses and its ability to achieve more durable revenues and higher returns from these initiatives, are forward- looking statements, and it is possible that the firm’s actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the targeted results indicated in these statements. Forward looking statements, including those about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio, and expense savings, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its business prospects and are subject to the risk that the firm may be unable to achieve its targets due to, among other things, changes in the firm’s business mix, lower profitability of new business initiatives, increases in technology and other costs to launch and bring new business initiatives to scale, and increases in liquidity requirements. Statements about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding the capital requirements applicable to the firm and are subject to the risk that the firm’s actual capital requirements may be higher than currently anticipated because of, among other factors, changes in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the firm resulting from changes in regulations or the interpretation or application of existing regulations or changes in the nature and composition of the firm’s activities. Statements about the timing and benefits of business and expense savings initiatives, the level and composition of more durable revenues and increases in market share are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its ability to implement these initiatives and may change, possibly materially, from what is currently expected.

End Notes These notes refer to the financial metrics and/or defined term presented on: Slide 7: Note: Past performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary. 1. Performance is based on net asset values as of 9/30/19 for Corporate Equity, Corporate Credit, and Real Estate Credit strategies. Performance is calculated by pooling the cash flows and calculating the IRR of the resulting cash flow stream on a capital-weighted basis for fee-paying investors. The information on which this performance is based is unaudited and reflects best available estimates, and therefore may be subject to change. Gross performance is based on aggregated cash flows without deduction for fees, carried interest, or fund expenses and includes leverage from fund-level credit facilities (which may enhance investor returns). Net performance is based on aggregated cash flows with deduction for fees, carried interest and fund expenses and includes leverage from fund-level credit facilities (which may enhance investor returns) 2. Index performance is calculated using the Modified PME approach, net of reasonable index transaction costs proxied to ETF expense ratios. Public Market Equivalent (PME), or the Index Comparison Method, is a methodology for calculating private market benchmark returns by using private fund cash flows and public market index returns. It is not possible to invest directly in an index, and the simulation seeks to provide a basis for comparing index returns with fund returns by mirroring the timing and amounts of cash flows of the fund to the index. The indices chosen for comparison were selected because we believe that they represent the closest public market alternative to investing in each of the applicable principal strategies 3. Reflects weighted average performance of Corporate Equity strategy since 2000 and specifically includes GSCP 2000, GSCP V, GSCP VI, the Pre-CPVII portfolio and WSCP VII. The Pre-CPVII portfolio represents all investments over $100mm made by the balance sheet and managed accounts between 2012 and 2016 (post-GSCP VI, but pre-WSCP VII). The benchmark is MSCI World Total Return Index 4. Reflects weighted average performance of all Senior Credit and Mezzanine vehicles managed by MBD since inception and since post-crisis, as applicable. Post-crisis reflects the following vehicles that were raised since 2009: BSLP 2013, BSLP III, SCP, SCP II, GSMP VI and GSMP VII. Senior Credit and Mezzanine strategies are benchmarked separately against S&P Global Leveraged Loan and BAML US High Yield Master II Total Return indices before aggregation 5. Reflects weighted average performance of all Real Estate Credit funds managed by MBD since inception and since post-crisis, as applicable. Post-crisis reflects the following funds that were raised since 2009: RECP II and RECP III. The benchmark is Bloomberg Barclays CMBS Total Return Index 6. Open Architecture Private Assets performance reflects all commingled client vehicles of the Private Equity Partners (first fund 1997), Private Equity Manager (first fund 2011), Vintage (first fund 1998), Petershill (first fund 2007), and Private Equity Co-investment Partners (first fund 2014) series of funds raised since 2000. These funds are closed to new investors. Performance is calculated by pooling the asset-weighted cash flows and 6/30/2019 asset valuations and calculating the IRR of the resulting cash flow stream. The information on which this performance is based is unaudited and reflects best available estimates, and therefore may be subject to change. Gross performance is based on the cash flows between the funds and their investments and do not deduct GSAM-related fees, carried interest, or GSAM vehicle expenses, but do deduct any management fees, carried interest, or expenses from third- party managers. Net performance is based on the aggregated cash flows of the fee-paying investors in the funds and includes GSAM-related fees, carried interest and vehicle expenses. Net performance figures also reflect the impact of all GSAM fund-level and underlying manager-level credit facilities, the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of underlying funds and/or portfolio companies, cash management, and hedging, which may enhance investor returns. Investor returns may be lower without these activities, but leverage will magnify the loss of capital to investors if investments experience negative performance 22 22End Notes These notes refer to the financial metrics and/or defined term presented on: Slide 7: Note: Past performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary. 1.

Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements Statements about the firm’s target metrics, including its target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, and statements about future operating expense (including future litigation expense), amount and composition of future Assets under Supervision, planned debt issuances, growth of deposits and associated interest expense savings, future geographic location of its employees, and the timing and profitability of its business initiatives, including its launch of new businesses or new activities, its ability to increase its market share in incumbent businesses and its ability to achieve more durable revenues and higher returns from these initiatives, are forward- looking statements, and it is possible that the firm’s actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the targeted results indicated in these statements. Forward looking statements, including those about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio, and expense savings, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its business prospects and are subject to the risk that the firm may be unable to achieve its targets due to, among other things, changes in the firm’s business mix, lower profitability of new business initiatives, increases in technology and other costs to launch and bring new business initiatives to scale, and increases in liquidity requirements. Statements about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding the capital requirements applicable to the firm and are subject to the risk that the firm’s actual capital requirements may be higher than currently anticipated because of, among other factors, changes in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the firm resulting from changes in regulations or the interpretation or application of existing regulations or changes in the nature and composition of the firm’s activities. Statements about the timing and benefits of business and expense savings initiatives, the level and composition of more durable revenues and increases in market share are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its ability to implement these initiatives and may change, possibly materially, from what is currently expected. Due to the inherent uncertainty in these forward-looking statements, investors should not place undue reliance on the firm’s ability to achieve these results.

Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements Statements about the firm’s target metrics, including its target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, and statements about future operating expense (including future litigation expense), amount and composition of future Assets under Supervision, planned debt issuances, growth of deposits and associated interest expense savings, future geographic location of its employees, and the timing and profitability of its business initiatives, including its launch of new businesses or new activities, its ability to increase its market share in incumbent businesses and its ability to achieve more durable revenues and higher returns from these initiatives, are forward- looking statements, and it is possible that the firm’s actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the targeted results indicated in these statements. Forward looking statements, including those about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio, and expense savings, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its business prospects and are subject to the risk that the firm may be unable to achieve its targets due to, among other things, changes in the firm’s business mix, lower profitability of new business initiatives, increases in technology and other costs to launch and bring new business initiatives to scale, and increases in liquidity requirements. Statements about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding the capital requirements applicable to the firm and are subject to the risk that the firm’s actual capital requirements may be higher than currently anticipated because of, among other factors, changes in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the firm resulting from changes in regulations or the interpretation or application of existing regulations or changes in the nature and composition of the firm’s activities. Statements about the timing and benefits of business and expense savings initiatives, the level and composition of more durable revenues and increases in market share are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its ability to implement these initiatives and may change, possibly materially, from what is currently expected. Due to the inherent uncertainty in these forward-looking statements, investors should not place undue reliance on the firm’s ability to achieve these results. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm’s future business, results and financial condition, see “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

End Notes These notes refer to the financial metrics and/or defined term presented on: Slide 9: 1. As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, the firm’s capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis were non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Management believes that the firm’s capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis are meaningful because they are the measures that the firm and investors use to assess capital adequacy. The table below presents reconciliations, for the Standardized approach, of common equity tier 1 and risk-weighted assets on a transitional basis to a fully phased-in basis as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017 (unaudited, $ in billions) Standardized CET1 Ratio As of September 30, 2017 As of December 31, 2017 Common equity tier 1, transitional basis $ 71.9 $ 67.1 Transitional adjustments (0.2) (0.1) $ 71.7 $ 67.0 Common equity tier 1, fully phased-in basis Risk-weighted assets, transitional basis $ 540 $ 556 Transitional adjustments 13 8 $ 553 $ 564 Risk-weighted assets, fully phased-in basis Common equity tier 1 ratio, transitional basis 13.3% 12.1% 13.0% 11.9% Common equity tier 1 ratio, fully phased-in basis 13 13End Notes These notes refer to the financial metrics and/or defined term presented on: Slide 9: 1.

Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements Statements about the firm’s target metrics, including its target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, and statements about future operating expense (including future litigation expense), amount and composition of future Assets under Supervision, planned debt issuances, growth of deposits and associated interest expense savings, future geographic location of its employees, and the timing and profitability of its business initiatives, including its launch of new businesses or new activities, its ability to increase its market share in incumbent businesses and its ability to achieve more durable revenues and higher returns from these initiatives, are forward- looking statements, and it is possible that the firm’s actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the targeted results indicated in these statements. Forward looking statements, including those about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE, efficiency ratio, and expense savings, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its business prospects and are subject to the risk that the firm may be unable to achieve its targets due to, among other things, changes in the firm’s business mix, lower profitability of new business initiatives, increases in technology and other costs to launch and bring new business initiatives to scale, and increases in liquidity requirements. Statements about the firm’s target ROE, ROTE and CET1 capital ratios, and how they can be achieved, are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding the capital requirements applicable to the firm and are subject to the risk that the firm’s actual capital requirements may be higher than currently anticipated because of, among other factors, changes in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the firm resulting from changes in regulations or the interpretation or application of existing regulations or changes in the nature and composition of the firm’s activities. Statements about the timing and benefits of business and expense savings initiatives, the level and composition of more durable revenues and increases in market share are based on the firm’s current expectations regarding its ability to implement these initiatives and may change, possibly materially, from what is currently expected. Due to the inherent uncertainty in these forward-looking statements, investors should not place undue reliance on the firm’s ability to achieve these results.
