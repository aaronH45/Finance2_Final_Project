ITEM 7.01.REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.

On March 13, 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded all U.S.-registered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. The American Airlines fleet currently includes 24 Boeing MAX 8 aircraft with an additional 76 aircraft on order from Boeing. We are complying with the FAA directive. Due to the continuing uncertainty regarding the timing of the return of these aircraft to service, on February 14, 2020 we announced flight cancellations through August 17, 2020 assuming that our 737 MAX 8 aircraft will not be available through that date. As such, compliance with the directive and the related flight cancellations have caused, and are expected to continue to cause, significant disruption to our customers and financial costs to us.
