Parsons as Chief Human Resources Officer, and the addition of two new key executives, Mike McDermott and Kris Malkoski, each of whom bring unique strengths and relevant backgrounds to galvanize the organization to win in the marketplace. In 2020, we will be laser focused on positioning the company for sustainable and profitable growth through clarity and stability of direction, strengthening the innovation funnel across the portfolio, striving for excellence in eCommerce and social marketing and executing flawlessly in the marketplace.” 

Chris Peterson, Chief Financial Officer and President, Business Operations, said, “Q4 marked a strong finish to the year reflecting steady progress in our turnaround. Core sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow were ahead of outlook, fueled by double digit eCommerce growth and a disciplined focus on productivity, overhead cost savings, complexity reduction and working capital initiatives. We more than doubled free cash flow in 2019 and reduced debt by more than $600 million in the quarter. As we look to 2020, we expect another year of progress, with core sales flat to down 2 percent, normalized operating margin up 10 to 40 basis points and normalized diluted EPS of $1.46 to $1.56. Operating cash flow is projected in the range of $1.0 to $1.15 billion, with free cash flow productivity in excess of 100%.” 

Fourth Quarter 2019 Operating Results

Net sales were $2.6 billion, a 3.1 percent decline compared to the prior year period, reflecting a 1.5 percent decline in core sales and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. 

Reported gross margin was 32.5 percent compared with 34.6 percent in the prior year period, as productivity and pricing were offset by headwinds from tariffs, inflation and mix. Normalized gross margin was 33.5 percent compared with 34.2 percent in the prior year period.

Fourth quarter 2019 reported operating income was $133 million compared with $74 million in the prior year period. Impairment charges of $75 million and $170 million were incurred in the current and prior year periods, respectively. Normalized operating income was $296 million compared with $307 million in the prior year period. Reported operating margin was 5.1 percent compared with 2.7 percent in the prior year. Normalized operating margin was 11.3 percent, unchanged from the prior year period. 

Interest expense was $71 million compared with $104 million in the prior year period, attributable to a reduction in outstanding debt.

The company reported a tax benefit of $720 million compared with a benefit of $99 million in the prior year period due to discrete tax benefits in the quarter. The normalized tax expense was $52 million compared with $70 million in the prior year period. 

The company reported net income of $794 million, or $1.87 diluted earnings per share, compared with $184 million, or $0.41 diluted earnings per share, in the prior year period, with the year over year change largely reflecting a more favorable tax benefit compared with the prior year. 

Normalized net income was $180 million, or $0.42 diluted earnings per share, compared with $297 million, or $0.66 diluted earnings per share, in the prior year period, with the year over year change attributable to the foregone contribution from divested businesses. 

An explanation of non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP results to comparable GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to this release. Normalized results in the year ago period have been recasted to include Rubbermaid Commercial Products, Mapa/Spontex and Quickie in continuing operations, as well as the depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recorded had these businesses been continuously classified as held and used.

Outlook for Full Year and First Quarter 2020

The company initiated its full year and first quarter outlook for 2020 as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The company has presented forward-looking statements regarding core sales, normalized operating margin, normalized net income, normalized diluted earnings per share and free cash flow productivity. These non-GAAP financial measures are derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses or income from the corresponding financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures is a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income recognized in a given period. The company is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking normalized operating margin, normalized net income, normalized earnings per share or free cash flow productivity to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because such information is not available, and management cannot reliably predict all the necessary components of such GAAP measures without unreasonable effort or expense. In addition, we believe such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company's full year 2020 financial results. These non-GAAP financial measures are preliminary estimates and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, among others, changes in connection with quarter-end and year-end adjustments. Any variation between the company’s actual results and preliminary financial data set forth above may be material.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This release contains non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and includes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

The company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures that are included in this press release and the additional financial information both to explain its results to stockholders and the investment community and in the internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The company’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures (a) permit investors to view the company’s performance and liquidity using the same tools that management uses to evaluate the company’s past performance, reportable business segments, prospects for future performance and liquidity, and (b) determine certain elements of management incentive compensation.

News Release

The company’s management believes that core sales provides a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales on a consistent basis as it excludes the impacts of acquisitions, planned and completed divestitures, retail store openings and closings, certain market exits, and changes in foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core sales also exclude the impact of returns associated with a recall in the Outdoor & Recreation segment. The effect of changes in foreign exchange on 2019 reported sales is calculated by applying the prior year average monthly exchange rates to the current year local currency sales amounts (excluding acquisitions and divestitures), with the difference between the 2019 reported sales and constant currency sales presented as the foreign exchange impact increase or decrease in core sales. The company’s management believes that “normalized” gross margin, “normalized” SG&A expense, “normalized” operating income, “normalized” operating margin, “normalized” net income, “normalized” diluted earnings per share, “normalized” income from continuing operations, “normalized” depreciation and amortization, “normalized” EBITDA, “normalized” interest and “normalized” tax benefits, which exclude restructuring and restructuring-related expenses and one-time and other events such as costs related to the extinguishment of debt, certain tax benefits and charges, impairment charges, pension settlement charges, divestiture costs, costs related to the acquisition, integration and financing of acquired businesses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, expenses related to certain product recalls and certain other items, are useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the company’s core ongoing operations and liquidity. "Free cash flow productivity” is calculated as the ratio of free cash flow (calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) to normalized net income, and the company believes that free cash flow productivity is an important indicator of liquidity realized from the company’s core ongoing operations. “Normalized EBITDA from continuing operations” is an ongoing liquidity measure (that excludes non-cash items) and is calculated as pro forma normalized earnings before interest, tax depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense. “Net debt to normalized continuing operations EBITDA leverage ratio” is a liquidity measure calculated as the ratio of total debt less cash and cash equivalents to normalized earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense.

The company determines the tax effect of the items excluded from normalized diluted earnings per share by applying the estimated effective rate for the applicable jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. In certain situations in which an item excluded from normalized results impacts income tax expense, the company utilizes a “with” and “without” approach to determine normalized income tax benefit. In the fourth quarter of 2019, these excluded items primarily reflected an income tax benefit of $522 million associated with the deferred tax effects associated with the internal realignment of certain intellectual property rights as well as an income tax benefit associated with a taxable loss related to the impairment of certain assets.

While the company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the company’s performance and liquidity, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.
