Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.   

On February 20, 2020, the Board of Directors of Texas Instruments Incorporated (“TI”) elected Mr. Michael D. Hsu to the Board of Directors of TI and to the Board’s Audit Committee effective April 1, 2020.  

In connection with his service as a director, Mr. Hsu will receive TI’s standard non-employee director cash and equity compensation as described in the Texas Instruments 2018 Director Compensation Plan, as amended. As a new director, Mr. Hsu will receive (i) a one-time initial equity award of restricted stock units with a grant-date value of approximately $200,000, and (ii) a pro rata portion of the $110,000 annual retainer for his service through the remaining portion of the year.  

The Board determined that Mr. Hsu has no relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with his exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities as director. There have been no transactions involving TI or any of its subsidiaries in which Mr. Hsu has or will have a direct or indirect material interest that are required to be disclosed by Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
