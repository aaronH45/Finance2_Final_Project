Adjusting for the items that impact period-to-period comparability listed in the table on the following page, net income attributable to common shareholders, as adjusted (non-GAAP) for the quarters ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $56,381,000 and $49,436,000, or $0.29 and $0.26 per diluted share, respectively.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ("FFO") attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions (non-GAAP) for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 was $311,876,000, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to $210,100,000, or $1.10 per diluted share, for the prior year's quarter. Adjusting for the items that impact period-to-period comparability listed in the table on page 3, FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted (non-GAAP) for the quarters ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $171,030,000 and $169,874,000, or $0.89 and $0.89 per diluted share, respectively.

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Financial Results

NET INCOME attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3.098 billion, or $16.21 per diluted share, compared to $384,832,000, or $2.01 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusting for the items that impact period-to-period comparability listed in the table on the following page, net income attributable to common shareholders, as adjusted (non-GAAP) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $176,716,000 and $238,700,000, or $0.92 and $1.25 per diluted share, respectively. 

FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions (non-GAAP) for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.003 billion, or $5.25 per diluted share, compared to $729,740,000, or $3.82 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusting for the items that impact period-to-period comparability listed in the table on page 3, FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted (non-GAAP) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $666,207,000 and $713,488,000, or $3.49 and $3.73 per diluted share, respectively.

The decreases in "net income attributable to common shareholders, as adjusted" and "FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted" were partially due to (i) $10,447,000, or $0.05 per diluted share, of non-cash expense for the time-based equity compensation granted in connection with the new leadership group announced in April 2019, (ii) $9,416,000 (at share), or $0.05 per diluted share, from the non-cash write-off of straight-line rent receivables, and (iii) $8,477,000, or $0.04 per share, of non-cash expense for the accelerated vesting of previously issued restricted Operating Partnership units and Vornado restricted stock due to the removal of the time-based vesting requirement for participants who have reached 65 years of age.

From inception to December 31, 2019, we closed on the sale of 65 units for aggregate net proceeds of $1,820,132,000. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid the remaining $737,000,000 of the $950,000,000 220 CPS loan.

Lexington

On March 1, 2019, we sold all of our 18,468,969 common shares of Lexington, realizing net proceeds of $167,698,000. We recorded a $16,068,000 gain (mark-to-market increase), which is included in "interest and other investment income, net" on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2019.

UE

On March 4, 2019, we converted to common shares and sold all of our 5,717,184 partnership units of UE, realizing net proceeds of $108,512,000. The sale resulted in a net gain of $62,395,000 which is included in "net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets" on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV

On April 18, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), we entered into a transaction agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) with a group of institutional investors (the “Investors”). The Transaction Agreement provides for a series of transactions (collectively, the “Transaction”) pursuant to which (i) prior to the Closing Date, we contributed our interests in properties located at 640 Fifth Avenue, 655 Fifth Avenue, 666 Fifth Avenue, 689 Fifth Avenue, 697-703 Fifth Avenue, 1535 Broadway and 1540 Broadway (collectively, the “Properties”) to subsidiaries of a newly formed joint venture (“Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV”) and (ii) on the Closing Date, transferred a 48.5% common interest in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV to the Investors. The 48.5% common interest in the joint venture represents an effective 47.2% interest in the Properties (of which 45.4% was transferred from Vornado). The Properties include approximately 489,000 square feet of retail space, 327,000 square feet of office space, signage associated with 1535 and 1540 Broadway, the parking garage at 1540 Broadway and the theater at 1535 Broadway. 

We retained the remaining 51.5% common interest in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV which represents an effective 51.0% interest in the Properties and an aggregate $1.828 billion of preferred equity interests in certain of the properties. We also provided $500,000,000 of temporary preferred equity on 640 Fifth Avenue until May 23, 2019 when mortgage financing was completed. All of the preferred equity has an annual coupon of 4.25% for the first five years, increasing to 4.75% for the next five years and thereafter at a formulaic rate. It can be redeemed under certain conditions on a tax deferred basis. 

Net cash proceeds from the Transaction were $1.179 billion, after (i) deductions for the defeasance of a $390,000,000 mortgage loan on 666 Fifth Avenue and the repayment of a $140,000,000 mortgage loan on 655 Fifth Avenue, (ii) proceeds from a $500,000,000 mortgage loan on 640 Fifth Avenue, described below, (iii) approximately $23,000,000 used to purchase noncontrolling investors' interests and (iv) approximately $53,000,000 of transaction costs (including $17,000,000 of costs related to the defeasance of the 666 Fifth Avenue mortgage loan). 

We continue to manage and lease the Properties. We share control with the Investors over major decisions of the joint venture, including decisions regarding leasing, operating and capital budgets, and refinancings. Accordingly, we no longer hold a controlling financial interest in the Properties which has been transferred to the joint venture. As a result, our investment in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV is accounted for under the equity method from the date of transfer. The Transaction valued the Properties at $5.556 billion resulting in a financial statement net gain of $2.571 billion, before noncontrolling interest of $11,945,000, including the related step up in our basis of the retained portion of the assets to fair value. The net gain is included in "net gain on transfer to Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV" on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2019. The gain for tax purposes was approximately $735,000,000.

On May 23, 2019, we received $500,000,000 from the redemption of our temporary preferred equity in 640 Fifth Avenue. The temporary preferred equity was redeemed from the proceeds of a $500,000,000 mortgage financing that was completed on the property. The five-year loan, which is guaranteed by us, is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.01%. The interest rate was swapped for four years to a fixed rate of 3.07%.

The net gain is included in "net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets" on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2019. The gain for tax purposes was approximately $139,000,000.

The gain for tax purposes was approximately $19,000,000.

NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS

The following table reconciles net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. A reconciliation of our net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions is provided above. In addition to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, we also disclose FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted. Although this non-GAAP measure clearly differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO, we believe it provides a meaningful presentation of operating performance. Reconciliations of FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted are provided on page 3 of this press release.

NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS - CONTINUED

Below is a reconciliation of net income to NOI at share and NOI at share - cash basis for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the three months ended September 30, 2019.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NOI at share represents total revenues less operating expenses including our share of partially owned entities. NOI at share - cash basis represents NOI at share adjusted to exclude straight-line rental income and expense, amortization of acquired below and above market leases, net and other non-cash adjustments. We consider NOI at share - cash basis to be the primary non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on NOI at share - cash basis, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. NOI at share and NOI at share - cash basis should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Same store NOI at share - cash basis is same store NOI at share adjusted to exclude straight-line rental income and expense, amortization of acquired below and above market leases, net and other non-cash adjustments. We present these non-GAAP measures to (i) facilitate meaningful comparisons of the operational performance of our properties and segments, (ii) make decisions on whether to buy, sell or refinance properties, and (iii) compare the performance of our properties and segments to those of our peers.
