PVH CORP. UPDATES 2019 FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR EARNINGS OUTLOOK IN CONNECTION WITH ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SALE OF ITS SPEEDO NORTH AMERICA BUSINESS 

New York, New York – PVH Corp. [NYSE: PVH] announced today that it is updating its fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings outlook in connection with its earlier announcement that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Speedo North America business to Pentland Group PLC (“Pentland”), parent company of Speedo International Limited, for $170 million in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment. Speedo International Limited licenses the Speedo trademark to a subsidiary of the Company for perpetual use in North America and the Caribbean; the subsidiary will be sold to a Pentland subsidiary as part of the transaction. The transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval.

The Company currently projects earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter 2019 will be approximately $(0.20).

The projected fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings per share on a GAAP basis include an estimated pre-tax non-cash loss of approximately $130 million expected to be recorded related to the sale of the Company's Speedo North America business to Pentland and the resulting deconsolidation of the Speedo net assets, as well as the estimated tax effect of the loss and the other amounts for the applicable period described below under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions.” Earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis for these periods, as discussed below, exclude these amounts. The Company's prior guidance for earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.56 to $1.58 for the fourth quarter 2019 and $8.04 to $8.06 for the full year 2019. 

Non-GAAP Basis

The Company currently projects its earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis for the fourth quarter and the full year 2019 will be at least $1.79 and $9.45, respectively, the high end of its guidance ranges previously announced.

•Pre-tax non-cash loss of approximately $130 million expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the sale of the Company’s Speedo North America business and the resulting deconsolidation of the Speedo net assets. 

•Estimated tax effects associated with the above pre-tax items, which are based on the Company’s assessment of deductibility. In making this assessment, the Company evaluated each item that it had identified above as a non-GAAP exclusion to determine if such item is taxable or tax deductible, and if so, in what jurisdiction the tax expense or tax deduction would occur. All items above were identified as either primarily taxable or tax deductible, with the tax effect taken at the applicable income tax rate in the local jurisdiction, or as non-taxable or non-deductible, in which case the Company assumed no tax effect.

PVH CORP.

Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts

2019 Net Income Per Common Share Reconciliations

The Company is presenting its 2019 estimated results on a non-GAAP basis by excluding (i) the costs incurred and expected to be incurred related to the Calvin Klein restructuring, consisting of a non-cash lease asset impairment resulting from the closure of the Company’s flagship store on Madison Avenue in New York, New York; other non-cash asset impairments; severance; contract termination and other costs; and inventory markdowns; (ii) the costs incurred in connection with the TH U.S. store closures, primarily consisting of non-cash lease asset impairments; (iii) the costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of the Company’s senior credit facilities; (iv) the costs incurred and expected to be incurred related to the Australia and TH CSAP acquisitions, primarily consisting of non-cash valuation adjustments; (v) the non-cash gain recorded to write up the Company's equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia to fair value in connection with the Australia acquisition; (vi) the one-time costs recorded on the Company’s equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia prior to the Australia acquisition closing, (vii) the costs incurred in connection with the Socks and Hosiery transaction; (viii) the expenses incurred and expected to be incurred resulting from the remeasurements of the mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest recognized in connection with the Australia acquisition; (ix) the non-cash loss expected to be recorded related to the sale of its Speedo North America business and the resulting deconsolidation of the Speedo net assets; and (x) the estimated tax effects associated with the foregoing pre-tax items. The Company has provided the reconciliations set forth below to present its estimates on a GAAP basis and excluding the foregoing amounts. The previous 2019 net income per common share guidance as provided in the Company’s 2019 third quarter earnings press release issued on November 25, 2019 and set forth below, presented on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, is no longer valid and presented only for informational purposes.

The 2019 estimated results are presented on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The Company believes presenting these results on a non-GAAP basis provides useful additional information to investors. The Company excludes such amounts that it deems to be non-recurring or non-operational and believes that excluding them (i) facilitates comparing current results against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods, thereby permitting management to evaluate performance and investors to make decisions based on the ongoing operations of the Company, and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others. The Company’s results excluding the items described above are also the basis for certain incentive compensation calculations. The non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company’s operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The information presented on a non-GAAP basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 

The estimated tax effects associated with the above pre-tax items are based on the Company’s assessment of deductibility. In making this assessment, the Company evaluated each pre-tax item identified above as a non-GAAP exclusion to determine if such item is taxable or tax deductible, and, if so, in what jurisdiction the tax expense or tax deduction would occur. All of the pre-tax items identified as non-GAAP exclusions were identified as either primarily taxable or tax deductible, with the tax effect taken at the applicable income tax rate in the local jurisdiction, or as non-taxable or non-deductible, in which case the Company assumed no tax effect.
