Page 5 of 26 

investors should monitor the Investor Relations section of our website, in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, presentations and webcasts. The information contained on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into, and is not a part of, this document. 

Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures that differ from financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

Sales change information for the three-month period and the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented on a GAAP (reported) basis and on a constant currency basis. Constant currency percentage changes exclude the effects of foreign currency exchange rates. They are calculated by translating current and prior-period sales at the same predetermined exchange rate. The translated results are then used to determine year-over-year percentage increases or decreases.  

Net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the three-month period and the year ended December 31, 2019 are presented on a GAAP (reported) basis and on an adjusted basis. Adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the effects of certain inventory and manufacturing-related charges, including charges to terminate a raw material supply agreement and to discontinue certain product lines; intangible asset amortization; intangible asset impairment; quality remediation expenses; restructuring and other cost reduction initiative expenses; acquisition, integration and related gains and expenses; certain litigation gains and charges; expenses to establish initial compliance with the European Union Medical Device Regulation; other charges; any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items, the effect of Switzerland tax reform and other certain tax adjustments.  

Free cash flow is an additional non-GAAP measure that is presented in this press release. Free cash flow is computed by deducting additions to instruments and other property, plant and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities. 

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this press release. This press release also contains supplemental reconciliations of additional non-GAAP financial measures that the Company presents in other contexts. These additional non-GAAP financial measures are computed from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as indicated in the applicable reconciliation. 

Page 6 of 26 

Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful incremental information to investors to consider when evaluating the performance of the Company. Management believes these measures offer the ability to make period-to-period comparisons that are not impacted by certain items that can cause dramatic changes in reported income but that do not impact the fundamentals of our operations. The non-GAAP measures enable the evaluation of operating results and trend analysis by allowing a reader to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items that are excluded from the non-GAAP measures. In addition, constant currency sales changes, adjusted operating profit, adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flow are used as performance metrics in our incentive compensation programs. 

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This press release also includes certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for the year ending December 31, 2020. We calculate forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures based on internal forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in GAAP financial measures. For instance, we exclude the impact of certain charges related to restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives and certain legal and tax matters. We have not provided quantitative reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because the excluded items are not available on a prospective basis without unreasonable efforts. For example, the timing of certain transactions is difficult to predict because management’s plans may change. In addition, the company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. It is probable that these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may be materially different from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.

In the 2019 periods, inventory and manufacturing-related charges include a $20.8 million charge incurred to terminate a raw material supply agreement recognized in the second quarter, excess and obsolete inventory charges on certain product lines we intend to discontinue and other inventory and manufacturing-related charges. The 2018 charges primarily relate to the excess and obsolete inventory charges on certain product lines we intend to discontinue and other inventory and manufacturing-related charges. The excess and obsolete inventory charges on certain product lines are driven by acquisitions where there are competing product lines and we have plans to discontinue one of the competing product lines.  

(2)  

We exclude intangible asset amortization from our non-GAAP financial measures because we internally assess our performance against our peers without this amortization. Due to various levels of acquisitions among our peers, intangible asset amortization can vary significantly from company to company. 

(3)  

In the second quarter of 2019 and third quarter of 2018, we recognized $70.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively, of in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) intangible asset impairment due to the termination of certain IPR&D projects. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $975.9 million. The impairment was comprised of $401.2 million in our Spine less Asia Pacific reporting unit, $567.0 million in our EMEA reporting unit and $7.7 million from an insignificant reporting unit. 

(4)  

We are addressing inspectional observations on Form 483 and a Warning Letter issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) following its previous inspections of our Warsaw North Campus facility, among other matters. This quality remediation has required us to devote significant financial resources and is for a discrete period of time. The majority of the expenses are related to consultants who are helping us to update previous documents and redesign certain processes. 

(5)  

In December 2019, our Board of Directors approved, and we initiated, a new global restructuring program that includes a reorganization of key businesses and an overall effort to reduce costs in order to accelerate decision-making and focus the organization on priorities to drive growth. We have reclassified $9.5 million and $34.2 million in the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2018, respectively, from Acquisition, integration and related to Restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives which is primarily attributed to project costs related to our supply chain optimization initiative. 

(6)  

The acquisition, integration and related gains and expenses we have excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures resulted from our merger with Biomet in 2015 and other various acquisitions. The acquisition, integration and related gains and expenses include the following types of gains and expenses:  

•  

Consulting and professional fees related to third-party integration consulting performed in a variety of areas, such as tax, compliance, logistics and human resources, and legal fees related to the consummation of mergers and acquisitions.  

•  

Employee termination benefits related to terminating employees with overlapping responsibilities in various areas of our business.  

•  

Dedicated project personnel expenses which include the salary, benefits, travel expenses and other costs directly associated with employees who are 100 percent dedicated to our integration of acquired businesses and employees who have been notified of termination, but are continuing to work on transferring their responsibilities.  

•  

Contract termination expenses related to terminated contracts, primarily with sales agents and distribution agreements.  

•  

Other various expenses to relocate facilities, integrate information technology, losses incurred on assets resulting from the applicable acquisition, and other various expenses. 

(7)  

We are involved in routine patent litigation, product liability litigation, commercial litigation and other various litigation matters. We review litigation matters from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective to determine if excluding the losses or gains will provide our investors with useful incremental information. Litigation matters can vary in their characteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results. The litigation charges and gains excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures in the periods presented relate to product liability matters where we have received numerous claims on specific products, patent litigation and commercial litigation related to a common matter in multiple jurisdictions. In regards to the product liability matters, due to the complexities involved and claims filed in multiple districts, the expenses associated with these matters are significant to our operating results. Once the litigation matter has been excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures in a particular period, any additional expenses or gains from changes in estimates are also excluded, even if they are not significant, to ensure consistency in our non-GAAP financial measures from period-to-period. 

(8)  

In the first quarter of 2019, we settled a patent infringement lawsuit out of court, and the other party agreed to pay us an upfront, lump-sum amount for a non-exclusive license to the patent. 

(9)  

The European Union Medical Device Regulation imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements. The new regulations provide a transition period until May 2020 for currently-approved medical devices to meet the additional requirements. For certain devices, this transition period can be extended until May 2024. We are excluding from our non-GAAP financial measures the incremental costs incurred to establish initial compliance with the regulations related to our currently-approved medical devices. The incremental costs primarily include third-party consulting necessary to supplement our internal resources. 

Page 20 of 26 

(10)  

We have incurred other various expenses from specific events or projects that we consider highly variable or that have a significant impact to our operating results that we have excluded from our non-GAAP measures. These include costs related to legal entity, distribution and manufacturing optimization, including contract terminations, as well as our costs of complying with our Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the U.S. government related to certain Foreign Corrupt Practices Act matters involving Biomet and certain of its subsidiaries. Under the DPA, which has a three-year term, we are subject to oversight by an independent compliance monitor, which monitorship commenced in August 2017. The excluded costs include the fees paid to the independent compliance monitor and to external legal counsel assisting in the matter. The primary costs in the 2019 periods were related to the DPA and distributor contract terminations. 

(11)  

In 2018, we finalized our estimates of the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”) based upon final guidance issued by U.S. tax authorities. 

(12)  

Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (“TRAF”) effective January 1, 2020. The federal provisions of the TRAF were enacted in the third quarter of 2019 and the cantonal provisions of the TRAF were enacted in the fourth quarter of 2019. In the third quarter of 2019, we recognized a $263.8 million provisional net tax benefit related to the federal components of the TRAF. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we recognized an additional $51.2 million net tax benefit related to the federal and cantonal components of the TRAF in addition to the tax impact of certain restructuring transactions in Switzerland. 

(13)  

Other certain tax adjustments relate to various discrete tax period adjustments, including changes in tax rates on deferred tax liabilities recorded on intangible assets recognized in acquisition-related accounting and adjustments from internal restructuring transactions that provide us access to offshore funds in a tax efficient manner.
