ITEM 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

On February 24, 2020, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Truist Financial Corporation (the “Company”) adopted a revised annual incentive program and a revised long-term incentive program under the Company’s 2012 Incentive Plan, as amended, to provide for annual and long-term incentive opportunities, respectively, for certain of the Company’s executive officers. These programs are intended to align the interests of the Company’s executive officers with both the short-term and long-term interests of our shareholders by using metrics that we believe are key drivers of sustained and longer-term shareholder value.

Under the annual incentive program, each of the Company’s executive officers selected by the Committee to participate in the annual incentive program for a particular fiscal year will be eligible to receive an award if the Company achieves a specified level of financial performance based on Earnings Per Share and Return on Average Assets, and qualitative performance based on a qualitative assessment of strategic priorities of the Company for that year. 

Under the long-term incentive program, each of the Company’s executive officers selected by the Committee to participate in the long-term incentive program for a particular fiscal year will be eligible to receive a combination of performance share units with a three-year performance period (“PSUs”), performance-based awards with a three-year performance period (“LTIP”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”). The long-term incentive program provides for the following: (i) PSUs – 40%, (ii) LTIP – 25% and (iii) RSUs – 35%. Executives will be eligible to receive PSUs and LTIP if the Company achieves a specified level of performance based on Relative Return on Average Common Equity and Relative Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (“ROATCE”). If the Company does not meet a minimum threshold of ROATCE for the three-year performance period, no payments may be made on performance awards under the long-term incentive program. RSUs under the long-term incentive program vest pro rata over four years. All awards are subject to forfeiture if the Committee determines that the Company has negative aggregate operating income or there is a significant negative risk outcome during the vesting period. 

Awards under the annual incentive program and long-term incentive program are subject to the Company’s clawback features and other terms and conditions.
