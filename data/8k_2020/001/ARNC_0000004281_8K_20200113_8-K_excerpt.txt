On January 13, 2020, Arconic Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an employment letter agreement with Timothy D.

Until the Separation, Mr. Myers will continue to serve as Executive Vice President and Group President, Global Rolled Products and Transportation and Construction Solutions. The effectiveness of the letter agreement is contingent upon the occurrence of the Separation no later than July 31, 2020 (as such date may be extended by mutual agreement of Mr. Myers and the Company). 

The letter agreement provides for an annual compensation package consisting of a base salary of $850,000, a target annual bonus award of 125% of base salary, and eligibility for annual equity compensation awards. Pursuant to the letter agreement, Mr. Myers’ 2020 annual equity award grants will consist of (i) a restricted share unit award with a grant date value of $1,720,000, which will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to Mr. Myers’ continued employment through such date, and (ii) a performance-based restricted share unit award with a grant date value (at target) of $2,580,000, which will be subject to performance goals applicable to Arconic Corporation, as well as Mr. Myers’ continued employment through the third anniversary of the grant date. The letter agreement also provides for relocation benefits in connection with Mr. Myers’ required relocation to the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania metropolitan area no later than September 30, 2020.
