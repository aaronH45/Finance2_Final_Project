“Quanta’s strong fourth quarter results complete the fourth consecutive year of revenue growth and record adjusted diluted earnings per share and backlog for the company.

With the exception of adjusted diluted earnings per share, the financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 include a $13.0 million ($20.7 million with associated tax benefits), or $0.14 per diluted share, gain recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the sale of our investment in the Fort McMurray West Electric Transmission Project located in Canada.  

Certain other items that impacted the fourth quarter of 2019 are reflected as adjustments in the calculation of Quanta’s adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock and are further described in the reconciliation of adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock.  

RECENT HIGHLIGHTS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   •    

Completed Sale of Ownership Interest in Alberta PowerLine (APL) - In December 2019, Quanta, along with ATCO Ltd., completed the sale of APL, a partnership between Quanta (20%) and ATCO (80%). Quanta received gross proceeds from the sale of approximately $46.6 million dollars and recognized a gain of $13.0 million. Quanta used the net proceeds from the sale to reduce debt under its senior secured revolving credit facility.  

   •    

Increased Quarterly Cash Dividend by 25% - In December 2019, Quanta’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of $0.05 per share, or a rate of $0.20 per share on an annualized basis, which represents a 25% increase from Quanta’s prior quarterly cash dividend paid in October 2019.  

   •    

Added Wataynikaneyap Transmission Project to Backlog - In October 2019, the Wataynikaneyap Transmission Project achieved financial close, and as a result, Quanta has included the project in its backlog as of December 31, 2019. Quanta previously announced its selection for this project in September 2019. The contract value for the project makes it one of the largest projects ever awarded to Quanta, and the scope of work consists of EPC services for more than 1,800 kilometers of transmission and distribution infrastructure in Northwestern Ontario, Canada.

RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018  

Revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019 were a record $12.11 billion, compared to revenues of $11.17 billion in the year ended December 31, 2018, and net income attributable to common stock was $402.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, or a record $2.73 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to common stock of $293.3 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) was a record $3.33 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $2.81 for the year ended December 31, 2018. These financial results, including GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share, include a $79.2 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, charge recognized in the second quarter of 2019 associated with the termination of a large telecommunications project in Peru and the recognition of $60.3 million ($43.9 million after-tax) in the first quarter of 2019, or $0.30 per diluted share, of previously deferred earnings on the Fort McMurray West Electric Transmission Project. With the exception of adjusted diluted earnings per share, also impacting the financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was the $13.0 million ($20.7 million with associated tax benefits), or $0.14 per diluted share, gain recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the sale of our investment in the Fort McMurray West Electric Transmission Project.  

Quanta completed seven acquisitions during 2019 and four acquisitions during 2018. Therefore, Quanta’s results include the results of the acquired businesses from their respective acquisition dates. For further information on the items that impacted comparability in 2019 and 2018, see the footnotes to the Supplemental Segment Data table and the non-GAAP reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock in the accompanying tables.  

OUTLOOK  

The long-term outlook for Quanta’s business is positive. However, weather, regulatory, permitting, project timing, execution challenges and other factors have impacted the company’s historical results, and may impact Quanta’s future financial results. Therefore, Quanta’s financial outlook for revenues, margins and earnings reflects management’s effort to align these uncertainties with the backlog the company is executing on and the opportunities expected to materialize during 2020. The following forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially.  

Prior to the company’s conference call, management will post a summary of Quanta’s 2020 guidance expectations with additional commentary in the “Financial Info” area of the Investor Relations section of Quanta’s website at http://investors.quantaservices.com.  

-MORE-   

Quanta expects 2020 revenues to range between $12.2 billion and $12.6 billion, net income attributable to common stock to range between $439 million and $499 million and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to range between $2.93 and $3.33. Quanta expects adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (a non-GAAP measure) to range between $3.62 and $4.02. EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) is expected to range between $961 million and $1.05 billion, and adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) is expected to range between $1.03 billion and $1.12 billion. See the accompanying tables for reconciliations of estimated adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to estimated GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the full-year 2020 and estimated EBITDA and estimated adjusted EBITDA to estimated GAAP net income attributable to common stock for the full-year 2020.  

Quanta’s outlook for 2020 includes the expected results of its Latin American (LATAM) operations. The company has completed a strategic review of its LATAM operations due to the circumstances it experienced in Peru in 2019 and political volatility in other countries in the region and has concluded it will pursue the orderly exit of these operations. The company is considering various options to that end and believes a significant portion of the process could be achieved in 2020. Quanta believes this course of action is prudent and will result in improved profitability and optimization of the company’s operational portfolio. In 2020, Quanta’s LATAM operations are expected to generate revenues of $20 million to $40 million, an operating loss of $15 million to $20 million and diluted loss per share of $0.10 to $0.13.  

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The non-GAAP measures in this press release are provided to enable investors, analysts and management to evaluate Quanta’s performance excluding the effects of certain items that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between reporting periods. In addition, management believes these measures are useful in comparing Quanta’s operating results with those of its competitors. These measures should be used in addition to, and not in lieu of, results prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).

Segment Results  

Quanta reports its results under two reportable segments: (1) Electric Power Infrastructure Services and (2) Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services, as set forth below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a)  

Latin America revenues and operating loss have been presented separately as a result of Quanta’s conclusion to pursue an orderly exit of its operations in Latin America. Included in the Latin American results for the year ended December 31, 2019 was a $79.2 million charge associated with the termination of a large telecommunications project in Peru. The charge consisted of a $48.8 million decrease in revenues and a $30.4 million increase in cost of services.  

 (b)  

Included in operating income for the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was an asset impairment charge of $1.6 million related to a planned sale of certain foreign operations and assets.  

 (c)  

Included in operating income for the Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were asset impairment charges of $10.2 million primarily related to the winding down and exit of certain oil-influenced operations and assets. Included in operating income for the Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 were asset impairment charges of $49.4 million and $52.7 million primarily related to the winding down of certain oil-influenced operations and assets. Additionally, included in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was the impact of $1.3 million in severance and restructuring costs related to the closure of certain operations.  

 (d)  

Included in corporate and non-allocated for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were $4.3 million and $24.8 million of acquisition and integration costs and $5.3 million and $13.4 million of increases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. Also included in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was an asset impairment charge of $2.1 million related to an internally-developed software application that has been replaced.

Remaining Performance Obligations and Backlog (a non-GAAP measure)  

Quanta’s remaining performance obligations represent management’s estimate of consolidated revenues that are expected to be realized from the remaining portion of firm orders for fixed price contracts not yet completed or for which work has not yet begun. For purposes of calculating remaining performance obligations, Quanta includes all estimated revenues attributable to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities, revenues from funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent they are reasonably expected to occur and revenues from change orders to the extent management believes additional contract revenues will be earned and are deemed probable of collection.  

While backlog is not a defined term under GAAP, it is a common measurement used in Quanta’s industry. Quanta believes this non-GAAP measure enables it to more effectively forecast its future results and better identify future operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. Quanta’s remaining performance obligations, as described above, are a component of Quanta’s backlog calculation, which also includes estimated orders under master service agreements (MSAs), including estimated renewals, and non-fixed price contracts expected to be completed within one year. Quanta’s methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies.  

The following table reconciles Quanta’s total remaining performance obligations to its backlog (a non-GAAP measure) by reportable segment along with estimates of amounts expected to be realized within 12 months:

Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share 

Attributable to Common Stock 

For the Three and Twelve Months Ended 

December 31, 2019 and 2018 

(In thousands, except per share information) 

(Unaudited)     

The following table presents the non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, which, when used in connection with diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s performance. Management believes that the exclusion of certain items from net income attributable to common stock enables it to more effectively evaluate Quanta’s operations period over period and better identify operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. As to certain of the items below, (i) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; (ii) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta’s ongoing acquisition activity, and therefore can vary from period to period; (iii) acquisition and integration costs vary period to period depending on the level of Quanta’s ongoing acquisition activity; (iv) asset impairment charges and severance and restructuring costs can vary from period to period depending on economic and other factors; (v) change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities varies from period to period depending on the performance in post-acquisition periods of certain acquired businesses; (vi) bargain purchase gains vary from period to period depending on Quanta’s acquisition activity and the valuation of acquired businesses; (vii) gains or losses on sales of investments vary from period to period depending on whether investments are sold and the variability of market and other factors impacting the value of such investments; (viii) income tax contingency releases vary period to period and depend on the level of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the expiration dates under various federal and state tax statute of limitations periods; (ix) adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) occurred during 2018 and varied period to period as additional information and guidance regarding the Tax Act became available; (x) changes in statutory tax rates are not regularly occurring items; (xi) tax settlements and adjustments to related indemnification assets vary from period to period depending on the status and resolution of pending matters and (xii) items related to entity restructuring and recapitalization efforts are not regularly occurring items. Because adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, as defined, excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common stock, adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock as presented in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net income attributable to common stock, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included below.

The following table presents the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, which when used in connection with net income attributable to common stock, are intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s performance. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates, and adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain other items as described below. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common stock or other measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the exclusion of these items from net income attributable to common stock enables it to more effectively evaluate Quanta’s operations period over period and to identify operating trends that might not be apparent when including the excluded items. As to certain of the items below, (i) equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates can vary from period to period depending on the activity and financial performance of unconsolidated affiliates, including deferral and subsequent recognition upon completion of construction of earnings on contracts performed for entities in which Quanta has an equity interest and gain or loss on sales of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting; (ii) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; (iii) acquisition and integration costs vary period to period depending on the level of Quanta’s ongoing acquisition activity; (iv) bargain purchase gains vary from period to period depending on Quanta’s acquisition activity and the valuation of acquired businesses; (v) asset impairment charges and severance and restructuring costs can vary from period to period depending on economic and other factors; (vi) change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities varies from period to period depending on the performance in post-acquisition periods of certain acquired businesses; and (vii) tax settlements and adjustments to related indemnification assets vary from period to period depending on the status and resolution of pending matters. Because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, as defined, exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common stock, such measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net income attributable to common stock, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included below.

Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow:  

The non-GAAP measure of free cash flow, when used in connection with net cash provided by operating activities, is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s ability to generate the cash required to maintain and potentially expand its business. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures. Net capital expenditures is defined as capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and from insurance settlements related to property and equipment.  

Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to Quanta’s investors because free cash flow is viewed by management as an important indicator of how much cash is provided or used by routine business operations, including the impact of net capital expenditures. Management uses this measure for capital allocation purposes as it is viewed as a measure of cash available to fund debt payments, including required quarterly payments under our outstanding term loans; acquire businesses; repurchase common stock; declare and pay dividends; and transact other investing and financing activities. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net cash provided by operating activities, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included below.

The following presents the non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, which, when used in connection with diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta’s performance. Management believes that the exclusion of certain items from net income attributable to common stock enables it to more effectively evaluate Quanta’s operations period over period and better identify operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. As to certain of the items below, (i) non-cash stock-based compensation expense may vary due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; (ii) amortization of intangible assets is impacted by Quanta’s acquisition activity, and therefore can vary from period to period; and (iii) change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities varies from period to period depending on the performance in post-acquisition periods of certain acquired businesses. Because adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, as defined, excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common stock, adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock as presented in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net income attributable to common stock, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included below.
