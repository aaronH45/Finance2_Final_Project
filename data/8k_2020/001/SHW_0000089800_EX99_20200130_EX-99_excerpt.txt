CLEVELAND, January 30, 2020 - The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE: SHW) announced its financial results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019. Compared to the same period in 2018, full year consolidated net sales increased $366.3 million, or 2.1%, to $17.90 billion due primarily to higher paint sales volume in The Americas Group and selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes reduced consolidated net sales for the year by 1.4%. Consolidated net sales in the quarter increased $50.2 million, or 1.2%, to $4.11 billion primarily due to higher paint sales volume in The Americas Group, partially offset by softer sales outside of North America and in certain industrial end markets.  

Diluted net income per share in the year increased to $16.49 per share from $11.67 per share for 2018. Full year 2019 included charges for acquisition-related costs of $3.21 per share and other adjustments totaling $1.42 per share. Other adjustments included non-cash impairment charges related to indefinite-lived trademarks of $1.00 per share, a tax credit investment loss of $.79 per share and pension plan settlement expense of $.27 per share, partially offset by a Brazil indirect tax credit of $.36 per share and a benefit from the resolution of the California public nuisance litigation of $.28 per share. Currency translation rate changes decreased diluted net income per share in the year by $.18 per share. Full year 2018 included charges for acquisition-related costs of $4.15 per share and other adjustments totaling $2.71 per share. Other adjustments included environmental expense provisions of $1.32 per share, California litigation expense of $1.09 per share and pension plan settlement expense of $.30 per share, respectively.  

Diluted net income per share increased in the quarter to $2.66 per share from $1.07 per share for 2018. Diluted net income per share in the quarter included charges for acquisition-related costs of $.97 per share and other adjustments totaling $.64 per share, which included non-cash impairment charges related to indefinite-lived trademarks of $1.00 per share, partially offset by a Brazil indirect tax credit of $.36 per share. Fourth quarter 2018 diluted net income per share included charges for acquisition-related costs of $1.10 per share and other adjustments totaling $1.37 per share, which included environmental expense provisions of $1.07 per share and a pension plan settlement expense of $.30 per share.   

During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized non-cash pre-tax impairment charges totaling $122.1 million related to recently acquired trademarks. The impairment charges were primarily driven by a reduction in long-term forecasted net sales for certain acquired brands as a result of strategic decisions made to rebrand industrial products to the Sherwin-Williams brand name. These impairment charges included $117.0 million related to trademarks recognized in the Performance Coatings Group and $5.1 million related to trademarks recognized in the Consumer Brands Group. Additionally, the Company recognized gains in other income and interest income of $33.5 million and $18.8 million, respectively, related to a Brazil indirect tax matter. The gains were recognized after the Company received a favorable court decision related to the recovery of certain indirect taxes previously paid over gross sales.  

Net sales in The Americas Group increased 5.7% to $10.17 billion in the year due primarily to higher paint sales across most end market segments and selling price increases. In the fourth quarter, net sales increased 4.8% to $2.36 billion due primarily to higher paint sales across most end market segments. Net sales from stores in U.S. and Canada open for more than twelve calendar months increased 5.3% in the year and 4.6% in the quarter over last year’s comparable periods. The Americas Group segment profit increased to $2.06 billion, or 20.2% of net sales, in the year from $1.90 billion, or 19.7% of net sales, last year due primarily to higher paint sales volume and selling price increases. In the fourth quarter, segment profit increased to $449.4 million, or 19.0% of net sales, from $413.4 million, or 18.3% of net sales, in the prior year quarter due primarily to higher paint sales volume.  

Net sales in the Consumer Brands Group decreased 2.3% to $2.68 billion in the year due to the divestiture of the Guardsman insurance business and lower sales outside of North America in some end markets, partially offset by selling price increases and higher volume sales to some of the group’s retail customers. In the fourth quarter, net sales increased 0.9% to $539.4 million due primarily to selling price increases and higher volume sales to some of the group’s retail customers. Segment profit increased to $373.2 million, or 13.9% of net external sales, in the year from $261.1 million, or 9.5% of net external sales, last year due to synergies, improved supply chain efficiencies, pricing initiatives, moderating raw material costs and lower acquisition-related amortization expense. In the fourth quarter, segment profit increased to $29.7 million, or 5.5% of net external sales, from $12.0 million, or 2.2% of net external sales, in the prior year quarter primarily due to pricing initiatives, moderating raw material costs and improved supply chain efficiencies. Currency translation rate changes increased segment profit by $3.9 million in the quarter. Acquisition-related amortization expense in the full year and fourth quarter of 2019 was $91.2 million and $23.2 million, respectively, compared to $110.9 million and $24.5 million in the full year and fourth quarter of 2018, respectively.  

Net sales of the Performance Coatings Group decreased 2.3% to $5.05 billion in the year and decreased 5.0% to $1.21 billion in the quarter due to softer sales outside of North America and unfavorable currency translation rate changes, partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes reduced the group’s full year and quarter sales by 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively. Segment profit decreased $73.0 million in the year to $379.1 million compared to $452.1 million in the prior year primarily due to the recognition of $117.0 million in non-cash impairment charges related to recently acquired trademarks, partially offset by moderating raw material costs and good cost control. As a percent of net external sales, segment profit in the year was 7.5%, including a 230 basis point impact from the non-cash impairment charges, compared to 8.8% in the prior year. Currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit by $7.1 million in the year. During the fourth quarter, segment loss was $7.4 million which included $117.0 million in non-cash impairment charges, compared to a segment profit of $112.3 million in the prior year   

quarter as the impact of lower sales was partially offset by moderating raw material costs and favorable currency translation rate changes. As a percent of net sales, segment profit in the quarter was a negative 0.6%, including a 970 basis point impact from the non-cash impairment charges, compared to 8.8% in the prior year quarter. Currency translation rate changes increased segment profit by $3.4 million in the quarter. Acquisition-related amortization expense in the full year and fourth quarter of 2019 was $215.5 million and $53.1 million, respectively, compared to $215.8 million and $55.2 million in the full year and fourth quarter of 2018, respectively.  

Net operating cash increased $377.6 million to $2.32 billion in the year. The strong cash generation allowed us to return cash of approximately $1.20 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The Company purchased 1,675,000 shares of its common stock in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, the Company had remaining authorization to purchase 8.45 million shares of its common stock through open market purchases.  

Commenting on the financial results, John G. Morikis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said “Sherwin-Williams delivered record results in 2019, driven by above-market growth in our North American paint stores and margin improvement in all of our segments. Sales grew to $17.90 billion as the strength of our stores platform and growth with our largest North American retail partners more than offset softness in certain industrial end markets and choppiness in our international businesses. Gross margin expanded to 44.9% as our pricing initiatives enabled us to gain ground on the raw material inflation we have experienced since 2017. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.3% to more than $3.0 billion, and adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $21.12, both of which are full year records. Net cash from operations was more than $2.32 billion, which enabled us to invest in organic growth initiatives, repurchase over 1.6 million shares of our common stock, reduce debt, increase our dividend 31% from the prior year and execute on selected acquisition targets.  

“Our global team delivered significant accomplishments in each of our operating segments. In The Americas Group, we reached the milestone of more than $10 billion in annual sales. In the Consumer Brands Group, we completed a very successful first full year of our exclusive partnership with Lowes. And in the Performance Coatings Group, we continued to execute on integration efforts that we expect will accelerate growth and margin expansion over the long term.  

“Turning to our 2020 outlook, we currently see a similar environment to last year, with North American architectural demand remaining solid and industrial demand remaining variable by geography and end market. We will continue to focus on providing our customers with solutions based on innovation, value-added service and differentiated distribution. In the first quarter of 2020, we anticipate our net sales will increase 2% to 5% compared to the first quarter of 2019. For the full year 2020, we expect net sales to increase 2% to 4% compared to full year 2019. With annual sales at that level, we anticipate diluted net income per share for 2020 will be in the range of $19.91 to $20.71 per share compared to $16.49 per share earned in 2019. Full year 2020 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related costs of approximately $2.79 per share, respectively. We expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be in the low twenty percent range.”

Regulation G Reconciliation  

Management of the Company believes that investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of diluted net income per share excluding Valspar acquisition-related costs and other adjustments. This adjusted earnings per share measurement is not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). It should not be considered a substitute for earnings per share computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following tables reconcile diluted net income per share computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP to adjusted diluted net income per share.
