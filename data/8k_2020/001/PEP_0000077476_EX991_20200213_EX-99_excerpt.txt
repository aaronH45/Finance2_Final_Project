Discussion of Fourth-Quarter 2019 Reported Division Results:

In addition to the reported net revenue performance as set out in the tables on pages 2 and A-7, reported operating results were driven by the following:

Frito-Lay North America (FLNA)

Operating profit increased 3%, primarily reflecting productivity savings and net revenue growth, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, a gain on the sale of an asset contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth.

Quaker Foods North America (QFNA)

Operating profit decreased 21%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses, unfavorable net pricing and a 4-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings, favorable mix and volume growth.

PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA)

Operating profit increased 5%, primarily driven by a 12-percentage-point impact of lower restructuring and impairment charges. Net revenue growth and productivity savings contributed to operating profit performance and were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, an 8-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, higher current-year gains on asset sales contributed 2.5 percentage points to operating profit performance. 

Latin America (LatAm)

Operating profit increased 16%, primarily reflecting productivity savings and net revenue growth, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 4-percentage-point impact of a prior-year insurance settlement recovery related to the 2017 earthquake in Mexico. Lower restructuring and impairment charges contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth.

Europe

Operating profit increased 28%, primarily reflecting net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 14-percentage-point net impact of our SodaStream International Ltd. (SodaStream) acquisition. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 14-percentage-point impact of a prior-year gain on the refranchising of our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia (CHS). 

Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA)

Operating profit decreased 11%, primarily driven by certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings and net revenue growth. Additionally, a prior-year gain on the sale of an asset negatively impacted operating profit performance by 8 percentage points. Merger and integration charges and higher restructuring and impairment charges negatively impacted operating profit performance by 9 percentage points.

Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region (APAC)

Operating profit increased 3%, primarily driven by a 9-percentage-point impact of lower restructuring and impairment charges. Additionally, certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses negatively impacted operating profit performance and were partially offset by volume growth and productivity savings.

Discussion of Full-Year 2019 Reported Division Results:

In addition to the reported net revenue performance as set out in the tables on pages 4 and A-7, reported operating results were driven by the following:

FLNA

Operating profit grew 5%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, a prior-year bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit growth.

QFNA

Operating profit decreased 15%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings. 

PBNA

Operating profit decreased 4%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses, an 8-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and the volume decline. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing and productivity savings. Year-over-year gains on asset sales negatively contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit performance. A gain associated with an insurance recovery positively contributed 1 percentage point to current-year operating profit performance and was offset by less-favorable insurance adjustments compared to the prior year, which negatively impacted the current-year operating profit performance by 1 percentage point. Additionally, a prior-year bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act positively contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit performance.

LatAm

Operating profit increased 9%, reflecting the effective net pricing and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 10-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs largely due to transaction-related foreign exchange. Unfavorable foreign exchange and higher restructuring and impairment charges each reduced operating profit growth by 2 percentage points.

Europe

Operating profit increased 6%, reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 10-percentage-point net impact of our SodaStream acquisition. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 10-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs largely due to transaction-related foreign exchange, higher advertising and marketing expenses, and a 4-percentage-point impact of a prior-year gain on the refranchising of our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in CHS. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced operating profit growth by 5 percentage points. 

AMESA

Operating profit increased 1.5%, reflecting productivity savings, the volume growth and the effective net pricing. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Higher restructuring and impairment charges and unfavorable foreign exchange reduced operating profit growth by 3 percentage points and 2.5 percentage points, respectively.

5

APAC

Operating profit decreased 23%, primarily reflecting a 23-percentage-point impact of the gain on the prior-year refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in Thailand. Additionally, certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses negatively impacted operating profit performance. These impacts were partially offset by the net revenue growth and productivity savings. Higher restructuring and impairment charges negatively impacted operating profit performance by 6 percentage points. 

6

Dividend Increase

The Company today announced a 7 percent increase in its annualized dividend to $4.09 per share from $3.82 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2020. This represents the Company’s 48th consecutive annual dividend per share increase.

Guidance and Outlook

The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we cannot predict certain elements which are included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange translation and commodity mark-to-market impacts.

For 2020, the Company expects: 

•Full-year organic revenue growth to be 4 percent.

•A core effective tax rate of approximately 21 percent.

•An increase in core constant currency EPS of 7 percent.

•Approximately $11 billion in cash from operating activities and free cash flow of approximately $6 billion, which assumes net capital spending of approximately $5 billion.

•Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $7.5 billion, comprised of dividends of $5.5 billion and share repurchases of $2 billion.

Applying current market consensus rates implies approximately 1-percentage-point foreign exchange translation headwind to reported net revenue and core EPS growth. This assumption and the guidance above imply 2020 core earnings per share of $5.88, a 6 percent increase compared to 2019 core earnings per share of $5.53.

Conference Call:

At 7:45 a.m. (Eastern time) today, the Company will host a conference call with investors and financial analysts to discuss fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results and the outlook for 2020. Further details will be accessible on the Company’s website at www.pepsico.com/investors.

Non-GAAP Measures

In discussing financial results and guidance, the Company refers to the following measures which are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP): core results, core constant currency results, free cash flow and organic results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. 

We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; amounts associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; pension and retiree medical related items; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures included herein. 

Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.

Glossary

We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:

Acquisitions and divestitures: All mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.

Beverage volume: Volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.

Bottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.

Concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers, retailers and independent distributors. 

Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior year average foreign exchange rates.

Core: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our historical results. For further information regarding these excluded items for the periods presented, refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2019 Form 10-K. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items:

Mark-to-market net impact

Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.

Restructuring and impairment charges

Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plans publicly announced in 2019 and 2014.

Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges

Charges primarily related to our acquisition of SodaStream, including incremental costs related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory, as well as merger and integration charges. 

A - 5

Pension-related settlement charges

Settlement charges related to the purchase of a group annuity contract and settlement charges related to one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits. 

Net tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. In periods subsequent to the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized certain tax benefits and/or expenses associated therewith.

Our provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of 2018 and while our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. 

Other net tax benefits

In the year ended December 29, 2018, other net tax benefits related to the reorganization of our international operations and non-cash tax benefits associated with both the conclusion of certain international tax audits and our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. 

Charges related to cash tender and exchange offers

In the year ended December 29, 2018, interest expense in connection with our cash tender and exchange offers, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes.

Effective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.

Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. We use free cash flow primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.

Net capital spending: Capital spending less cash proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment.

Organic: A measure that adjusts for impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, foreign exchange translation and, when applicable, the impact of the 53rd reporting week.

2020 guidance

Our 2020 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Our 2020 core effective tax rate guidance and 2020 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses and restructuring and impairment charges. Our 2020 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2020 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2020 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2020 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2020 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2020 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2020 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2020 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2020 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.
