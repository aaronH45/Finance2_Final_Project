11 Geographic region overview – consolidated 4Q PRASM up 0.8% year - over - year Domestic Latin Pacific Atlantic 1 Based on full year 2019 capacity . 2 During the third quarter of 2019 , United implemented a new revenue accounting software system which allowed it to more precisely determine the geographic regions associated with certain ancillary passenger revenue items . Prior to July 2019 , those ancillary revenue items were determined using an allocation method that was based on revenue from passenger travel . While the total passenger revenue is not impacted, the geographic totals for each period are not comparable year - over - year due to the change . The fourth quarter 2018 passenger revenue utilized in the year - over - year comparisons displayed reallocates these ancillary items using the 2019 allocation . For more information, please refer to United’s earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2019 , dated January 21 , 2020 .

Question & Answer Session  

22 Appendix A: reconciliation of GAAP to Non - GAAP financial measures UAL evaluates its financial performance utilizing various accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of Am eri ca (GAAP) and Non - GAAP financial measures, including adjusted pre - tax income (loss), adjusted pre - tax margin, adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted non - fuel expense, adjusted net income (loss) and C ASM, excluding special charges, third - party business expenses, fuel, and profit sharing, among others. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges is useful to investors because special charges are not indicati ve of UAL’s ongoing performance. UAL believes that adjusting for unrealized (gains) losses on investments is useful to investors because those unrealized gains or losses may not ultimately be realized on a cash basis. U AL believes that adjusting for interest expense related to finance leases of Embraer ERJ 145 aircraft is useful to investors because of the accelerated recognition of interest expense. For additional information relate d t o special charges, see the press release issued by UAL, dated January 21, 2020, and furnished on that date with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to UAL’s Form 8 - K . Reconciliations of reported non - GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included below.

24 Appendix A: reconciliation of GAAP to Non - GAAP financial measures (continued) CASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline’s cost structure and efficiency. UAL reports CASM exc luding special charges, third - party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges is useful to investors because special charges are not indicative of UAL’s ongoin g p erformance. UAL also believes that excluding third - party business expenses, such as maintenance, ground handling and catering services for third parties and fuel sales, provides more meaningful disclosure beca use these expenses are not directly related to UAL’s core business. UAL also believes that excluding fuel costs from certain measures is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management’s p erf ormance excluding the effects of a significant cost item over which management has limited influence. UAL excludes profit sharing because this exclusion allows investors to better understand and analyze our o per ating cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry.
