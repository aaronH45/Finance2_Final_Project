 Item 5.02Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  

On February 5, 2020, in connection with the previously announced separation (the “Separation”) of Arconic Inc. (the “Company”) into two independent, publicly-traded companies: the Company, which will be renamed Howmet Aerospace Inc. in connection with the Separation, and a new company, Arconic Rolled Products Corporation, which will be renamed Arconic Corporation in connection with the Separation (“Arconic Corporation”), Messrs. Christopher L. Ayers, Elmer L. Doty, and E. Stanley O’Neal were appointed to serve on the Board of Directors of Arconic Corporation, and accordingly, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company accepted their respective resignations from the Board, in each case effective as of the effective time of, and contingent upon, the Separation. 

In addition, the Board, upon recommendation of its Governance and Nominating Committee, appointed Joseph S. Cantie, Robert F. Leduc, Jody G. Miller and Nicole W. Piasecki as directors of the Company, in each case effective as of the effective time of, and contingent upon, the Separation. Messrs. Cantie and Leduc and Mmes. Miller and Piasecki will be appointed to serve on one or more committees at a later date. 

Messrs. Cantie and Leduc and Mmes. Miller and Piasecki will receive compensation for their service on the Board pursuant to the compensation program for the Company’s non-employee directors, as in effect from time to time during their service on the Board. The Company’s current non-employee director compensation program is described on pages 15-20 of the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 28, 2019. In addition, the Company will enter into indemnity agreements with each of Messrs. Cantie and Leduc and Mmes. Miller and Piasecki, in the form approved in principle by the Company’s stockholders and which the Company has entered into with each of its directors to supplement the indemnification coverage provided by the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”). (See Form of Indemnification Agreement between the Company and individual directors or officers, incorporated by reference to exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K (Commission file number 1-3610) dated January 25, 2018.) 

 Item 5.03Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.  

On February 5, 2020, the Board approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation that will change the name of the Company from Arconic Inc. to “Howmet Aerospace Inc.” This amendment will be effective at the effective time of the Separation. Pursuant to the DGCL, the amendment does not require approval of the Company’s stockholders. 

On February 5, 2020, the Board approved an amendment to the Company’s Bylaws, effective as of the completion of the Separation. The amendment will replace all references in the Bylaws to “Arconic Inc.” with the words “Howmet Aerospace Inc.” 

The foregoing summary of the amendments to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the amendments attached hereto as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2 and incorporated herein by reference. 

 Item 8.01Other Events.  

On February 5, 2020, the Board approved the completion of the Separation by means of a pro rata distribution (the “Distribution”) by the Company of all of the outstanding common stock of Arconic Corporation. To consummate the Separation and the Distribution, the Board declared a pro rata distribution of Arconic Corporation common stock, which is expected to be effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on April 1, 2020, to Company stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2020 (the “Record Date”). 

In the Distribution, each Company stockholder will receive one share of Arconic Corporation common stock for every four shares of the Company’s common stock held as of the close of business on the Record Date. Stockholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Arconic Corporation common stock. 

The Separation and the Distribution are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, as more fully described in Arconic Corporation’s Registration Statement on Form 10 (File No. 001-39162), as amended.
