 Financial Results  

 Fourth Quarter 2019  

 Net income available to the company’s common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $92.8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $73.6 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2018. The increase was due primarily to an $80.8 million reduction in property sales (Kimco’s pro-rata share) during the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The lower level of property sales resulted in reduced impairment charges of $40.6 million. However, the reduction in impairment charges was offset by a decrease of $29.1 million in gains on the sales of operating properties. Depreciation expense also decreased by $6.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to the company’s disposition activity during 2019.  

 NAREIT Funds From Operations (FFO)* was $151.9 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2019 compared to $149.6 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2018. NAREIT FFO for the fourth quarter of 2019 included $3.4 million of transactional charges (net of transactional income) compared to $2.2 million of transactional income (net of transactional charges) in the fourth quarter of 2018.  

 *A reconciliation of net income available to the company’s common shareholders to NAREIT FFO, FFO as adjusted and same-property NOI is provided in the tables accompanying this press release.   

 FFO as adjusted available to common shareholders (FFO as adjusted)*, which excludes the effects of transactional income and charges, was $155.3 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2019 compared to $147.4 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2018.  

 Full Year 2019

 Operating Results    Pro-rata occupancy ended the fourth quarter at 96.4%, matching an all-time high and representing a 60-basis-point increase compared to the end of 2018.   Pro-rata anchor occupancy ended the quarter at a record 98.9%, representing an expansion of 150 basis points over the end of 2018.   Pro-rata small shop occupancy ended the quarter at 89.3%, representing a sequential decrease of 60 basis points and a 180-basis-point decrease year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year changes were primarily attributable to the closures associated with Payless, Charming Charlie, Avenue and Dress Barn stores in 2019.

 (1)      

 Certain amounts have been reclassified in order to conform with NAREIT's clarification guidance adopted January 1, 2019.    

 (2)     Related to gains, impairments and depreciation on properties, where applicable.  

 (3)      

 Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period. Funds from operations would be increased by $199 and $228 for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Funds from operations would be increased by $868 and $916 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.     

 Funds From Operations (“FFO”) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement (""FFO White Paper - 2018 Restatement"") which clarifies, where necessary, existing guidance and consolidates alerts and policy bulletins into a single document for ease of use. NAREIT defines FFO as net income/(loss) available to the Company’s common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), excluding (i) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (ii) gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, (iii) gains and losses from change in control, (iv) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and (v) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Included in the FFO White Paper - 2018 Restatement is an option for the Company to make an election to include or exclude gains and losses on the sale of assets and impairments of assets incidental to its main business in the calculation of FFO. In conjunction with the adoption of the FFO White Paper - 2018 Restatement, the Company has elected to exclude gains/impairments on land parcels, gains/losses (realized or unrealized) from marketable securities and gains/impairments on preferred equity participations in NAREIT defined FFO.  

 The Company’s reconciliation of net income available to the Company’s common shareholders to FFO available to the Company’s common shareholders and FFO available to the Company’s common shareholders as adjusted, is reflected in the table above (in thousands, except per share data). In conjunction with the adoption of NAREIT’s FFO White Paper – 2018 Restatement, the Company has reclassified $3.4 million from transactional charges and $10.9 million from transactional income into FFO available to the Company’s common shareholders for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, relating to incidental gains and losses on the sale of assets and mark-to-market changes in equity securities. This reclassification had no impact on FFO available to the Company’s common shareholders as adjusted for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018.
