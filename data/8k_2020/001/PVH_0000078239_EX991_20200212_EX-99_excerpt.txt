PVH CORP. PROVIDES UPDATES ON BUSINESS IMPACT OF CORONAVIRUS AND 2019 FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR OUTLOOK

New York, New York – PVH Corp. [NYSE: PVH] announced today that it is working with local authorities to ensure the health, wellness and safety of its associates and business partners in connection with the coronavirus outbreak in China.

Emanuel Chirico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are closely monitoring the situation in China. Our priority is the well-being of our associates and business partners, their families and local communities, and our hearts are with those that have been impacted by the coronavirus. I want to sincerely thank our dedicated associates in Asia who are going above and beyond, with many working remotely from home, to drive our business forward.”

Currently, the majority of the total CALVIN KLEIN and TOMMY HILFIGER stores (company-operated and franchise) in China are temporarily closed due to coronavirus concerns, including as a result of related government-imposed restrictions. Further, the stores that are open are operating for limited hours and are experiencing significantly lower than planned traffic and sales trends.

Greater China is expected to account for approximately 7% of the Company’s 2019 revenue and the Asia Pacific region is expected to account for approximately 16% of the Company’s 2019 revenue. Additionally, approximately 20% of the Company’s global sourcing is derived from China, including approximately 10% of sourcing inbound to the U.S.

The Company also announced an update to its earnings guidance:

GAAP Basis

The Company currently expects its earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 will be lower than its guidance previously announced on January 9, 2020 due to an actuarial loss expected to be recognized on its retirement plans in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily resulting from a decrease in the discount rate in the latter part of January 2020. Earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis for these periods, discussed below, excludes this loss and the resulting estimated tax effect, as well as the other amounts for the applicable period described below under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions.” The Company's guidance for earnings per share on a GAAP basis previously announced on January 9, 2020 is approximately $(0.20) for the fourth quarter 2019 and approximately $6.32 for the full year 2019.

Non-GAAP Basis

Although the Company's earnings guidance announced on January 9, 2020 did not contemplate the coronavirus outbreak, the Company is reaffirming its guidance with respect to earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is expected to be at least $1.79 for the fourth quarter 2019 and 

2

at least $9.45 for the full year 2019, as previously announced on January 9, 2020. The Company believes that it would have exceeded its non-GAAP earnings guidance had the coronavirus outbreak not occurred during the last two weeks of its fiscal year. 

Mr. Chirico continued, “While the coronavirus will impact our businesses in the near-term, our long term growth opportunities across the Asia Pacific region are significant. Given our diversified, global business model and the strength of our iconic brands, we are well-positioned to manage this period of uncertainty. We will provide an operational and financial update on our upcoming fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call.”

Non-GAAP Exclusions:

The amounts in this release that are referred to as non-GAAP amounts exclude the following:

•Pre-tax costs of approximately $105 million incurred and estimated to have been incurred in 2019 in connection with the restructuring associated with the strategic changes for the Calvin Klein business announced in January 2019, consisting of a non-cash lease asset impairment resulting from the closure of the Company’s flagship store on Madison Avenue in New York, New York, other non-cash asset impairments, severance, contract termination and other costs, and inventory markdowns, of which $70 million was incurred in the first quarter, $29 million was incurred in the second quarter, $3 million was incurred in the third quarter and approximately $2 million is estimated to have been incurred in the fourth quarter.

•Pre-tax costs of $55 million incurred in the first quarter of 2019 in connection with the closure of the Company’s TOMMY HILFIGER flagship and anchor stores in the U.S., primarily consisting of non-cash lease asset impairments.

•Pre-tax costs of $60 million incurred in the second quarter of 2019 in connection with the agreements to terminate early the licenses for the global Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger North America socks and hosiery businesses in conjunction with the Company’s plan to

consolidate the socks and hosiery business for all Company brands in North America in a newly formed joint venture, which began operations in December 2019, and to bring in-house the international Calvin Klein socks and hosiery wholesale businesses.

•Pre-tax costs of $6 million incurred in the first quarter of 2019 in connection with the refinancing of the Company’s senior credit facilities. 

•Pre-tax non-cash gain of $113 million recorded in the second quarter of 2019 to write up the Company's equity investments in Gazal Corporation Limited (“Gazal”) and PVH Brands Australia Pty. Limited to fair value in connection with the Company’s acquisition of the approximately 78% interest in Gazal that it did not already own (the “Australia acquisition”). 

•Pre-tax costs of approximately $22 million incurred and estimated to have been incurred in 2019 in connection with the Australia acquisition and the Company’s acquisition of the Tommy Hilfiger retail business in Central and Southeast Asia from the Company’s previous licensee in that market, primarily consisting of non-cash valuation adjustments, of which $7 million was incurred in the second quarter, $9 million was incurred in the third quarter and approximately $6 million is estimated to have been incurred in the fourth quarter.

•Pre-tax expenses of approximately $7 million incurred and estimated to have been incurred in 2019 resulting from the remeasurements of the Company’s mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest, which was recognized in connection with the Australia acquisition, of which $3 million was recognized in the third quarter and approximately $4 million is estimated to be recognized in the fourth quarter.

•Pre-tax non-cash loss of approximately $130 million expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the sale of the Company’s Speedo North America business and the resulting deconsolidation of the Speedo net assets. 

•Estimated tax effects associated with the above pre-tax items, which are based on the Company’s assessment of deductibility. In making this assessment, the Company evaluated each item that it had identified above as a non-GAAP exclusion to determine if such item is taxable or tax deductible, and if so, in what jurisdiction the tax expense or tax deduction would occur. All items above were identified as either primarily taxable or tax deductible, 

4

with the tax effect taken at the applicable income tax rate in the local jurisdiction, or as non-taxable or non-deductible, in which case the Company assumed no tax effect.
