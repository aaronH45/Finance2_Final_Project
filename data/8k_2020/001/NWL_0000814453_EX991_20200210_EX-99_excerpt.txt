(1) As reported on the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three-months period ending March 31, 2019. 

(2) Due to a change in strategy, management recommended and in July 2019 the Company’s Board of Directors approved the decision not to continue pursuing the sale of the majority of the Rubbermaid Commercial Products, Rubbermaid Outdoor, Closet, Refuse and Garage ("Commercial Business"). 

Management also concluded in October 2019 not to continue pursuing the sale of the Mapa/Spontex ("Mapa") and Quickie businesses. Based on the financial profile of these businesses, as compared to the expected proceeds, the Company determined that retention of these businesses would maximize their value to the Company. 

(3) Normalization adjustments include $65.1 million of acquisition amortization costs ($30.7 million of which is reported in discontinued operations); $21.6 million of bad debt related to a customer in the Baby business; $7.9 million of restructuring ($0.3 million of which is reported in discontinued operations); $6.0 million of costs related to the proxy contest; acquisition related costs of $5.6 million; divestiture costs of $4.8 million ($2.9 million of which is reported in discontinued operations) primarily related to the planned and completed divestitures; fire-related losses, net of insurance recoveries of $(2.8) million in the Writing business; gain on disposition of $0.6 million for a working capital adjustment related to the Tools business; and $0.3 million of pension settlement costs ($0.1 million of which is reported in discontinued operations). 

(4) Depreciation and amortization expense related to the Commercial Business, and the Mapa and Quickie businesses that would have been recorded had these been continuously classified as held and used. 

(5) The Company determined the tax effect of the items excluded from normalized results by applying the estimated effective rate for the applicable jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. In certain situations in which an item excluded from normalized results impacts income tax expense, the Company uses a "with" and "without" approach to determine normalized income tax expense.
