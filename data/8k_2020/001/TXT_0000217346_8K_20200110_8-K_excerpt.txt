   Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers  

(e) On January 10, 2020, the Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Textron approved a new design of the company’s long-term incentive compensation program for 2020 for Textron’s executive officers, reflecting feedback through engagement with its shareholders, a review of peer practices, and consultation with its independent consultant. The Committee increased the percentage of performance share units included in the mix of grant type, changed the vesting schedule of restricted stock units, and restructured performance share units. No changes were made to stock option terms and conditions. 

For 2020 awards under the Textron Inc. 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the mix of grant types will be redistributed such that 50% of the grant value for each executive officer will be in the form of performance share units, 25% in the form of stock options, and 25% in the form of restricted stock units. Restricted stock units awarded in 2020 to executive officers will be settled in stock upon vesting, and vesting will occur in full on the third anniversary of the grant date. 

For performance share units granted in 2020, the Committee will select the performance criteria and set the weighting and targets for each metric upon grant for the three-year performance cycle of the award instead of setting performance goals annually. The Committee approved the following metrics for the performance share units granted for the 2020-2022 cycle: three-year Average Return on Invested Capital, weighted at 50%, three-year Cumulative Manufacturing Cash Flow, weighted at 30%, and three-year Relative Total Shareholder Return, weighted at 20%. The threshold payout opportunity on performance share units will be 25% and the maximum payout opportunity on performance share units will be 200%.
