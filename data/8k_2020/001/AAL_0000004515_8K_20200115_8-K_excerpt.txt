ITEM 7.01.REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.

As previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter of 2018, American Airlines Group Inc. (the Company) elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update 2016-02: Leases (Topic 842) (the New Lease Standard) as of January 1, 2018. A significant portion of the adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 to adopt the New Lease Standard related to prior 2018 quarters. The Company previously recast the 2018 quarters for the adoption of the New Lease Standard in Note 17 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A of its 2018 Form 10-K filed on February 25, 2019. Note 17 presents a table of summarized financial data by quarter.

This filing is to provide a convenient table based on the 2018 annual income statement and the unaudited quarterly income statements, in each case as previously reported and as recast. In particular, the quarterly “recast” data in the table below, when aggregated, equals the amounts shown in the 2018 annual statement of operations as filed in the Company's 2018 Form 10-K. 

No change has been made in any of the income statement amounts previously presented in the Company’s 2018 Form 10-K or in the comparative 2018 periods of the Company’s 2019 Form 10-Qs. Similarly, the summarized financial data table in Note 17 remains unchanged.

The information in this Item 7.01 is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
