Full Year 

Diluted net income per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased twenty-three cents, or 3.9%, to $6.06 per share compared to $5.83 per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Net income - Omnicom Group Inc. for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased $12.7 million, or 1.0%, to $1,339.1 million compared to $1,326.4 million in the same period in 2018. 

Net income - Omnicom Group Inc. for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 includes a net after-tax increase of $18.2 million as a result of a net gain on dispositions of certain subsidiaries, less charges in connection with repositioning actions and an increase to income tax expense for adjustments related to the 2017 provisional amounts for the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Tax Act"), as discussed further below. 

Adjusting for the impact of those items, net income - Omnicom Group Inc. for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 would have increased $30.9 million and diluted net income per share would have increased thirty-one cents per share, or 5.4%. 

Primarily due to the negative effects of foreign exchange rates and disposition activity in excess of acquisitions over the past year, worldwide revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 decreased 2.2% to $14,953.7 million from $15,290.2 million in the same period of 2018. The components of the change in revenue included a decrease in revenue from the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 2.1%, a decrease in acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue of 2.9% and an increase in revenue from organic growth of 2.8% when compared to the same period of 2018. 

Organic growth for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 in our five fundamental disciplines was as follows: Advertising increased 4.5%, CRM Consumer Experience increased 1.6%, CRM Execution & Support decreased 3.2%, Public Relations decreased 2.0% and Healthcare increased 9.5%. 

Across our regional markets, organic growth for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018 was as follows: the United States increased 2.7%, Other North America increased 4.2%, the United Kingdom increased 3.3%, the Euro Markets and Other Europe increased 3.0%,

Asia Pacific increased 2.2%, Latin America decreased 0.2% and the Middle East and Africa increased 6.5%. 

Operating profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 decreased $11.2 million, or 0.5%, to $2,122.3 million from $2,133.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Our operating margin for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased to 14.2% versus 14.0% for the same period of 2018. Operating profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 reflects a net pre-tax increase of $29.0 million from the net gain on dispositions of certain subsidiaries of $178.4 million, which arose primarily from the sale of Sellbytel, our European-based outsourced sales, service and support business, less expenses of $149.4 million in connection with repositioning actions related to the continuing improvement of the strategic position and operating efficiencies of our businesses. 

Adjusting for the impact of those items, operating profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased $17.8 million, or 0.8%, to $2,122.3 million from $2,104.5 million for the same period in 2018, while operating margin for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 increased to 14.2% versus 13.8% for the same period of 2018. 

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our effective income tax rate was 26.0% compared to 25.6% for the same period in 2018. The effective tax rate for the twelve months of 2018 reflects the impact of a lower tax rate on the net gain on dispositions of subsidiaries in the third quarter of 2018, substantially offset by an increase in tax expense reflecting an adjustment to the provisional amounts related to the 2017 Tax Act. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

We use certain non-GAAP financial measures in describing our performance. 2018 Non-GAAP Adjusted results (which include Operating Profit - 2018 Non-GAAP Adjusted and Net Income - Omnicom Group Inc., 2018 Non-GAAP Adjusted), which adjusts for the impact of the net gain recognized on dispositions of certain subsidiaries, certain repositioning actions and the revision of the provisional income tax expense amounts recorded in connection with the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, are presented in the full year results presented above and in the tables in this release. We believe that the 2018 Non-GAAP Adjusted results are useful measures for investors to understand the impact these actions had on the comparability of our reported results.

Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. 

Definitions - Components of Revenue Change 

We use certain terms in describing the components of the change in revenue above. 

Foreign exchange rate impact: calculated by translating the current period’s local currency revenue using the prior period average exchange rates to derive current period constant currency revenue. The foreign exchange rate impact is the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. Dollars and the current period constant currency revenue. 

Acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue: Acquisition revenue is calculated as if the acquisition occurred twelve months prior to the acquisition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of acquisitions through the acquisition date. As a result, acquisition revenue excludes the positive or negative difference between our current period revenue subsequent to the acquisition date and the comparable prior period revenue and the positive or negative growth after the acquisition date is attributed to organic growth. Disposition revenue is calculated as if the disposition occurred twelve months prior to the disposition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of disposals through the disposition date. The acquisition revenue and disposition revenue amounts are netted in the description above. 

Organic growth: calculated by subtracting the foreign exchange rate impact component and the acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue component from total revenue growth.
