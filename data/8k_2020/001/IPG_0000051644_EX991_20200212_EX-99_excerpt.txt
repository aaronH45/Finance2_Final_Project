Outlook 

"We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter performance, as well as full-year financial results that deliver on our targets. Our results again demonstrate the strength of our client-centric, integrated model, and the quality of our offerings. Our differentiated culture and strategy are key reasons our long-term trajectory has been so strong, which has helped us to deliver leading organic growth and margin improvement in recent years,” commented Michael Roth, Chairman and CEO of IPG. 

“As we turn to our outlook for 2020, our first thoughts are ones of concern and support for our people, clients, and partners in China, and for everyone around the world contending with the

coronavirus outbreak. We are closely monitoring the situation and are focused on the well-being and safety of our people, and are taking appropriate steps to protect them during this difficult period,” added Mr. Roth.

“As our results demonstrate, IPG remains highly relevant to marketers in an increasingly crowded and complex environment. We have a strong portfolio of companies that combine marketing expertise and future-facing media, data and technology capabilities, which we can deliver through our collaborative open architecture model. Our 2020 targets are for organic growth of 3% and to further improve EBITA margin by an additional 20 basis points. We remain committed to our robust capital return program, as is evident in today’s announcement that our Board has again approved an increase in our dividend. We are also focused on debt reduction, with a view toward returning to share buybacks in the future as part of our capital allocation programs. We are confident that this combination of operating performance and capital returns will allow us to build on our strong track record of enhancing shareholder value," Mr. Roth concluded.

During the fourth quarter of 2019, salaries and related expenses were $1.43 billion, an increase of 0.6% compared to the same period in 2018. For the full year 2019, salaries and related expenses were $5.57 billion, an increase of 5.1% compared to 2018. 

Staff cost ratio, which is total salaries and related expenses as a percentage of net revenue, was 58.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 59.0% in the same period in 2018. For the full year 2019, staff cost ratio was 64.6% compared to 66.0% in the same period in 2018, primarily due to base salaries, benefits and tax, and temporary help expenses increasing at rates less than net revenue growth. The improved ratio was also attributable to carefully managing our employee base in addition to the inclusion of Acxiom for the full year, which had a lower ratio of salaries and related expenses as a percentage of its net revenue.

During the fourth quarter of 2019, office and other direct expenses were $419.7 million, an increase of 10.2% compared to the same period in 2018. For the full year 2019, office and other direct expenses were $1.56 billion, an increase of 15.4% compared to 2018. The increase in office and other direct expenses was mainly due to the inclusion of Acxiom for the full year, which has a higher ratio of office and other direct expenses as a percentage of its net revenue, primarily driven by client service costs and professional fees. 

During the fourth quarter of 2019, selling, general and administrative expenses were $24.5 million compared to $81.0 million in 2018, a decrease of 69.8%, primarily attributable to lower incentive expense and professional fees, mainly driven by transaction costs related to the acquisition of Acxiom in 2018. For the full year 2019, selling, general and administrative expenses were $93.8 million compared to $166.5 million in 2018, a decrease of 43.7%. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower professional fees, mainly driven by transaction costs related to the acquisition of Acxiom in 2018 and an increase in allocated service fees from Selling, General and Administrative expenses to Cost of Services, mainly as a result of the inclusion of Acxiom. 

During the fourth quarter of 2019, depreciation and amortization was $65.4 million, a decrease of 5.1% compared to the same period in 2018. For the full year 2019, depreciation and amortization was $278.5 million, an increase of 37.3% compared to 2018 primarily due to the inclusion of Acxiom. 

During the full year 2019, restructuring charges were $33.9 million due to the implementation of a cost initiative to better align our cost structure with our revenue, primarily related to client losses occurring in 2018.

Net interest expense decreased by $2.9 million to $38.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 from a year ago. Full year 2019 net interest expense increased by $63.6 million to $164.8 million from a year ago, primarily due to debt issued in 2018 to fund the Company's acquisition of Acxiom. 

Other expense, net was $24.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 and $42.9 million for the full year 2019, primarily due to losses recorded on sales of businesses.
