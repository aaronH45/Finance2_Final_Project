Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure. 

United Airlines Holdings, Inc. ("UAL"), the holding company whose primary subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. ("United," and together with UAL, the "Company"), previously announced its plans to host an Investor Day on March 5, 2020. As the spread of coronavirus ("COVID-19") has continued and the market reaction has worsened, investor concerns are focused almost exclusively on the near-term impact on demand and how the Company is managing it. Given that, the Company does not believe it is practical to expect that it can have a productive conversation focused on its long-term strategy next week. As a result the Company has decided to postpone Investor Day, which the Company now currently plans to hold in September 2020. 

The Company still plans to participate in several conferences in March 2020. From March 1st to 3rd, 2020, Gerry Laderman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Pam Hendry, Vice President and Treasurer, of the Company, and Michael Leskinen, Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations, of United, plan to participate in the ISTAT Americas conference in Austin, TX. On March 10, 2020, Scott Kirby, President of the Company, is scheduled to be the keynote speaker at the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference in New York, NY. Mr. Kirby's comments are expected to include discussion of the proactive steps the Company is taking to manage the challenges posed by COVID-19. The Company plans to provide information regarding accessing the webcast of Mr. Kirby's presentation at a later date. Mr. Kirby will be joined by Andrew Nocella, the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and Mr. Laderman for meetings with investors during the conference.

The Company remains confident in its long-term outlook, including the 2022 adjusted diluted earnings per share range, 2022 and 2023 adjusted free cash flow targets and target cap on leverage (defined as adjusted debt to adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rent (EBITDAR)) included in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 24, 2020. 

The information in this Item 7.01, is being furnished and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements:

Certain statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K are forward-looking and thus reflect the Company's current expectations and beliefs with respect to certain current and future events and anticipated financial and operating performance. Such forward-looking statements are and will be subject to many risks and uncertainties relating to the Company's operations and business environment that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements.

Additionally, forward-looking statements include statements that do not relate solely to historical facts, such as statements which identify uncertainties or trends, discuss the possible future effects of current known trends or uncertainties, or which indicate that the future effects of known trends or uncertainties cannot be predicted, guaranteed or assured.

The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.
