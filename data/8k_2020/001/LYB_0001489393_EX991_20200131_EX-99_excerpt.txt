LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE: LYB) today announced net income for the fourth quarter 2019 of $0.6 billion, or $1.83 per share. Fourth quarter 2019 EBITDA was $1.2 billion. Full year 2019 net income was $3.4 billion, or $9.58 per share, and EBITDA was $5.7 billion. The full year 2019 included $89 million of integration costs that impacted earnings by $0.26 per share that were partially offset by an $85 million non-cash tax settlement that increased earnings by $0.24 per share. Integration activities related to the 2018 acquisition of A. Schulman are on schedule with $130 million in forward annual run-rate synergies as of December 31, 2019.

“During 2019 LyondellBasell continued to exhibit strong cash generation and remained committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Over each of the past six years, we have consistently delivered $5-6 billion in cash from operating activities. We affirmed our commitment to a strong and progressive dividend during 2019 by increasing our quarterly dividend for the eleventh time and returning a total of $5.2 billion in dividends and

share repurchases to shareholders. Our businesses benefited from abundant and low-cost natural gas liquid feedstocks throughout the year, and we demonstrated our capability to derive value from M&A through the integration of the A. Schulman acquisition,” said Bob Patel, LyondellBasell CEO.

“During the fourth quarter, margins within most of our businesses were impacted by slow industrial demand and typical seasonality. Low-cost butane supported the highest fourth quarter profitability for our Oxyfuels and Related Products business over the past five years. Refining margins improved on a higher Maya 2-1-1 crack spread and relatively strong prices for naphtha and coke. Our Technology business achieved record licensing revenues, contributing to the most profitable year in company history for the segment.”

“In 2019, we developed opportunities to expand into new markets by leveraging LyondellBasell technologies to strengthen our position in Asia. In June, we announced new polypropylene capacity through our Thailand joint venture, HMC Polymers. In September, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Liaoning Bora Enterprise Group to build an integrated cracker and expand our footprint in the rapidly growing Chinese market. Recently, we announced our intention to expand our existing partnership with Sinopec to build a second propylene oxide (PO) and styrene monomer (SM) plant in China utilizing our advantaged technology. Our leading technologies are satisfying rising demand for our products in the fastest growing regions of the world,” Patel said.

OUTLOOK

“Our foundations of operational excellence, cost management and disciplined capital allocation continue to serve us well in the current challenging environment. We anticipate typical seasonal improvements for our businesses as we progress through the second and third quarters of 2020. Favorable resolution of trade policies and a rebound in industrial demand could provide significant upside for our industry. With the expected benefits from the IMO 2020 regulations for our Houston Refinery and the completion of our new Hyperzone project, we are well-poised to extend LyondellBasell’s outstanding track record of cash generation,” said Patel.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Three months ended December 31, 2019 versus three months ended September 30, 2019 - EBITDA increased $28 million versus the third quarter 2019. Margins improved due to an increase in the Maya 2-1-1 industry benchmark crack spread of $1.31 per barrel to $19.44 per barrel and relative strong prices for naphtha and coke. The Houston Refinery continued to run reliably with a small increase in crude throughput of 3,000 barrels per day to 267,000 barrels per day.

The Maya 2-1-1 crack spread increased significantly by $8.55 per barrel to $19.44 per barrel.

The Houston Refinery operated at 267,000 barrels per day, 83,000 barrels per day more than the prior period due to the completion of planned maintenance in the second half of 2018.

Full year ended December 31, 2019 versus full year ended December 31, 2018 - EBITDA decreased $232 million versus 2018. Margins decreased due to limited availability of favorably-priced heavy sour crude oil in the U.S. Gulf Coast and a decrease in the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread of $2.27 per barrel to $17.58 per barrel.
