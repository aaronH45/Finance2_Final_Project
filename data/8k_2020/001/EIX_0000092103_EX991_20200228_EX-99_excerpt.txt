 Forward-Looking Statements Statements contained in this presentation about future performance, including, without limitation, operating results, capital expenditures, rate base growth, dividend policy, financial outlook, and other statements that are not purely historical, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations; however, such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from current expectations. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations only as of the date of this presentation, and Edison International assumes no duty to update them to reflect new information, events or circumstances. Important factors that could cause different results include, but are not limited to the: • ability of SCE to recover its costs through regulated rates, including costs related to uninsured wildfire-related and mudslide-related liabilities, costs incurred to mitigate the risk of utility equipment causing future wildfires and costs incurred to implement SCE's new customer service system; • ability of SCE to implement its WMP, including effectively implementing Public Safety Power Shut-Offs when appropriate; • ability to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost, including insurance relating to SCE's nuclear facilities and wildfire-related claims, and to recover the costs of such insurance or, in the event liabilities exceed insured amounts, the ability to recover uninsured losses from customers or other parties; • risks associated with AB 1054 effectively mitigating the significant risk faced by California investor-owned utilities related to liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires where utility facilities are alleged to be a substantial cause, including SCE's ability to maintain a valid safety certification, SCE's ability to recover uninsured wildfire-related costs from the Wildfire Insurance Fund, the longevity of the Wildfire Insurance Fund, and the CPUC's interpretation of and actions under AB 1054, including their interpretation of the new prudency standard established under AB 1054; • decisions and other actions by the CPUC, the FERC, the NRC and other regulatory and legislative authorities, including decisions and actions related to determinations of authorized rates of return or return on equity, the recoverability of wildfire-related and mudslide-related costs, issuance of SCE's wildfire safety certification, wildfire mitigation efforts, and delays in regulatory and legislative actions; • ability of Edison International or SCE to borrow funds and access bank and capital markets on reasonable terms; • risks associated with the decommissioning of San Onofre, including those related to public opposition, permitting, governmental approvals, on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, delays, contractual disputes, and cost overruns; • extreme weather-related incidents and other natural disasters (including earthquakes and events caused, or exacerbated, by climate change, such as wildfires), which could cause, among other things, public safety issues, property damage and operational issues; • physical security of Edison International's and SCE's critical assets and personnel and the cybersecurity of Edison International's and SCE's critical information technology systems for grid control, and business, employee and customer data; • risks associated with cost allocation resulting in higher rates for utility bundled service customers because of possible customer bypass or departure for other electricity providers such as CCAs and Electric Service Providers; • risks inherent in SCE's transmission and distribution infrastructure investment program, including those related to project site identification, public opposition, environmental mitigation, construction, permitting, power curtailment costs (payments due under power contracts in the event there is insufficient transmission to enable acceptance of power delivery), changes in the CAISO's transmission plans, and governmental approvals; and • risks associated with the operation of transmission and distribution assets and power generating facilities, including public and employee safety issues, the risk of utility assets causing or contributing to wildfires, failure, availability, efficiency, and output of equipment and facilities, and availability and cost of spare parts. Other important factors are discussed under the headings “Forward-Looking Statements”, “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” in Edison International’s Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on our website: www.edisoninvestor.com.

 2019 Wildfire Legislation Update Summary of Assembly Bill 1054 and Assembly Bill 111 Safety • Creates Wildfire Safety Division1 to provide additional wildfire safety oversight Oversight • Annual safety certifications issued by Wildfire Safety Division1 require: 1) an approved wildfire mitigation plan; 2) utility to be in and good safety standing; 3) established board safety committee with relevant safety experience; 4) board-level reporting to the Certification CPUC on safety issues5) approved executive compensation structure that promotes safety, ensures public safety and utility financial stability; 6) compensation limits on executive officer contracts; and 7) implementation of, and reporting to the CPUC on wildfire mitigation plans, safety culture assessments and board safety committee recommendations Cost • Provided a utility is “safety certified” and elects to participate in the wildfire “insurance” fund (described below), establishes a Recovery FERC-like prudence standard to guide recovery of costs arising from catastrophic wildfires occurring after bill enactment Standard • Prudence is based on reasonable utility conduct with potential for full or partial recovery, considering factors within and beyond a utility’s control • FERC-like standard assumes utility is prudent, unless intervenors create serious doubt, shifting burden to the utility to prove prudence Wildfire • Establishes a wildfire fund to help wildfire victims and affected communities recover and rebuild more quickly Fund • Wildfire “insurance” fund is an insurance-like fund that more broadly socializes wildfire costs; utilities’ participation is voluntary • Fund includes a $10.5 billion ratepayer contribution through a 15-year extension of the Department of Water Resources bond charge; wildfire insurance fund also includes $10.5 billion contribution from utility shareholders • All three IOUs have elected to participate. PG&E must emerge from bankruptcy by June 30, 2020 to participate  SCE’s shareholders initially contributed approximately $2.4 billion on September 10 and expect to contribute approximately $95 million annually on January 1 for 10 years2 Mitigation • First $1.6 billion of SCE’s fire risk mitigation capital expenditures as approved in wildfire mitigation plans shall not earn an equity CapEx return, but can be recovered from ratepayers through a securitizable dedicated rate component2 Liability Cap • While fund remains solvent, wildfire cost disallowances capped over each trailing 3-year period to 20% of T&D equity rate base • Must be safety certified and not found to be acting with willful or conscious disregard of the safety of others 1. Wildfire Safety Division created within CPUC until duties transferred to newly formed Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety on or after July 2021 2. Excluded from measurement of regulatory capital structure February 28, 2020 14

If the option is exercised, SCE’s rate base would be offset by that amount 3. In January 2020, SCE supplemented the existing CPUC record with additional analysis as it relates to the Project need which included alternative projects with lower costs as well as an update to the original project cost that is not reflected in the table above. SCE is unable to predict the timing of a final CPUC decision, the corresponding in-service date, and what the final project costs will be for the Alberhill project 4. While the Riverside Transmission Reliability Project total cost is currently $451 million, the CPUC issued a proposed decision, which if adopted, would increase the project cost to $584 million 5. Total Costs are nominal direct expenditures, subject to CPUC and FERC cost recovery approval. SCE regularly evaluates the cost and schedule based on permitting processes, given that SCE continues to see delays in securing project approvals February 28, 2020 23

 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Edison International's earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States. Management uses core earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Core earnings are also used when communicating with investors and analysts regarding Edison International's earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance from period to period. Core earnings are a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings (or losses) are defined as earnings or losses attributable to Edison International shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as: exit activities, including sale of certain assets, and other activities that are no longer continuing; asset impairments and certain tax, regulatory or legal settlements or proceedings. A reconciliation of Non-GAAP information to GAAP information is included either on the slide where the information appears or on another slide referenced in this presentation.
