St. Paul, Minn. — February 27, 2020 — Patterson Companies, Inc. (Nasdaq: PDCO) today reported consolidated net sales of approximately $1.46 billion (see attached Sales Summary for further details) in its fiscal third quarter ended January 25, 2020, an increase of 4.3 percent compared to the same period last year. Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation and changes in product selling relationships, also increased 4.3 percent.  

Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 totaled $23.2 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to $31.2 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The year-over-year decrease in the period is primarily the result of a pre-tax charge related to the early retirement of debt and restructuring costs.  

Adjusted net income1 attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., which excludes deal amortization costs, integration and business restructuring expenses, legal expenses, accelerated debt-related costs and discrete tax matters, totaled $44.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $35.6 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2019, or $0.38 per diluted share. The year-over-year increase in the period is primarily attributable to the improved performance across all three categories of Patterson’s dental segment, including consumables, equipment and value-added services.  

“Patterson’s focused and disciplined approach to accelerate performance drove both improved top-line growth and margin expansion during the third quarter,” said Mark Walchirk, President and CEO of Patterson Companies. “In our Dental segment, we achieved positive consumables growth and continued to generate strong sales growth in equipment and value-added services. In Animal Health, we delivered continued growth in our companion business and trends in our production business improved despite end market challenges. As a result of our improved performance, we are raising our fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings guidance range to $1.50 to $1.55 from its prior range of $1.36 to $1.46 per diluted share.”  

Patterson Dental  

Reported net sales in our Dental segment for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which represented approximately 44 percent of total company sales, were $626.6 million compared to $579.7 million in the third quarter of last year. Internal sales increased 8.0 percent compared to the fiscal 2019 third quarter.  

Patterson Animal Health  

Reported net sales in our Animal Health segment for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which comprised approximately 56 percent of the company’s total sales, were $817.3 million compared to $807.5 million in the third quarter of last year. Internal sales for the segment increased 1.3 percent from the fiscal 2019 third quarter.

Balance Sheet and Capital Allocation  

During the first nine months of fiscal 2020 Patterson Companies used $169.0 million of cash from operating activities and collected deferred purchase price receivables of $359.3 million, netting $190.3 million in cash, compared to a total of $384.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019. The previous year period contained a trade accounts receivable facility amount of $171.0 million and the current period contained a trade accounts receivable facility amount of $29.0 million. Free cash flow1 (see definition below and attached free cash flow table) generated year-to-date in fiscal 2020 is $51.5 million lower than the year ago period primarily due to the timing of cash conversion associated with the financing of a higher level of equipment sales and increased inventory.  

In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, Patterson Companies paid $25.0 million in cash dividends to shareholders. On a year-to-date basis, Patterson has returned $75.5 million in cash dividends to shareholders.  

Year-to-Date Results  

Consolidated reported net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 totaled $4.2 billion, a 1.6 percent year-over-year increase. Internal sales have increased 2.2 percent compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2019. Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. was $20.1 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to $55.6 million, or $0.60 per diluted share in last year’s period. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to an increase in legal expenses and a pre-tax charge related to the early retirement of debt, partially offset by an investment gain. Adjusted net income1 attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., which excludes deal amortization costs, integration and business restructuring expenses, legal expenses, accelerated debt-related costs, discrete tax matters and an investment gain, totaled $106.5 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, compared to $95.9 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, in the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to improved performance in the dental segment across consumables, equipment and value-added services.

   •    

Non-GAAP adjusted earnings1 are now expected to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.55 per diluted share.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Integration and business restructuring expenses of $12.4 million ($0.13 per diluted share).  

   •    

Legal expenses of $74.1 million ($0.78 per diluted share).

Our guidance is for current operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions and does not include the impact of potential future acquisitions or similar transactions, if any, or impairments and material restructurings beyond those previously publicly disclosed. Our guidance assumes North American and international market conditions similar to those experienced in fiscal 2019.  

1Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

The Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Measures table appearing behind the accompanying financial information is provided to adjust reported GAAP measures, namely operating income, income before taxes, income tax expense, net income, net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., for the impact of deal amortization costs, integration and business restructuring expenses, legal expenses, accelerated debt-related costs and an investment gain, along with the related tax effects of these items.  

 PATTERSON COMPANIES | 1031 Mendota Heights Road | Saint Paul, MN 55120     NEWS RELEASE   

The term “free cash flow” used in this release is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures less the one-time benefit from the initiation of our trade account receivables facility plus collection of deferred purchase price receivables.  

In addition, the term “internal sales” used in this release represents net sales adjusted to exclude foreign currency impact and changes in product selling relationships. Foreign currency impact represents the difference in results that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the company uses to convert results for all foreign entities where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. The company calculates the impact as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period’s currency exchange rates. The company believes the disclosure of net sales changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates.  

Management believes that these non-GAAP measures may provide a helpful representation of the company’s third-quarter performance and earnings guidance, and enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures.

Investors can listen to a live webcast of the conference call at www.pattersoncompanies.com. The conference call will be archived on the Patterson Companies website.
