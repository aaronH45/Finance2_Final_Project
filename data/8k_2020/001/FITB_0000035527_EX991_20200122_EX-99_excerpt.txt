CEO Commentary  

“Our fourth quarter and full year results were strong, reflecting the strength of our diversified revenue streams, our continued expense discipline, and our ability to achieve our targeted financial outcomes from the MB Financial acquisition. Net interest income, noninterest income, and noninterest expense were in-line with or better than our previous guidance. We generated very strong fee revenue, including a new record in capital markets. Additionally, our net interest income results continue to reflect our ability to successfully manage the balance sheet despite the lower rate environment, which led to better than expected NIM performance for the quarter. Also, we continued to diligently manage our expenses, reflecting our ongoing focus on generating efficiencies throughout the Bank while still investing in high priority areas to support revenue growth.”  

“We also successfully completed a transaction with FIS that has addressed the future payments related to our TRA. Similar to all the strategic decisions over the past ten years related to this relationship, this agreement has created significant value for our shareholders. We have successfully recognized over $7 billion on a pre-tax basis for shareholders from all sources since the spin-off of our legacy processing business, with another $195 million in TRA cash flows beyond this quarter’s transaction yet to be monetized.”  

“From a balance sheet perspective, our loan growth was consistent with our prior guidance, reflective of the generally subdued macroeconomic environment. Also, we again generated strong core deposit growth while also proactively reducing deposit costs more than our previous guidance.”  

“We remain on-track to achieve the previously-stated expense and revenue synergy targets related to the MB Financial acquisition. We continue to be pleased with the low client and employee attrition levels.”  

“Our clearly defined strategic growth priorities, proactive balance sheet management, and ongoing discipline throughout the Bank position us well for the future. We expect to build on our strong fourth quarter NIM performance and maintain our expense discipline in order to generate positive operating leverage this year while continuing to invest for long-term outperformance.”

Compared to the year-ago quarter, reported NII increased $147 million, or 14%. Excluding purchase accounting accretion of $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, adjusted NII increased $129 million, or 12%, reflecting an increase in interest-earning assets, including the impact from the MB Financial acquisition, partially offset by the declining rate environment.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Upon conversion of Fifth Third Bank to a national charter in the fourth quarter of 2019, Fifth Third changed its accounting policy to conform to Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) guidance regarding non-reaffirmed loans included in Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings to be accounted for as nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and collateral dependent loans regardless of payment history and capacity to pay in the future. As a result of the change in accounting policy, TDRs increased $105 million, of which $83 million were transferred to NPL status. Due to the fact that the collateral dependent loans require the carrying value to be less than or equal to the appraised value less the cost to sell, Fifth Third also incurred a $10 million increase in charge-offs during the quarter, which resulted in a $9 million impact to provision for loan and lease losses. In addition, Fifth Third changed its accounting policy to conform to OCC guidance associated with branch-related real estate no longer intended to be used for banking purposes, which resulted in an increase in OREO of $30 million, with an offsetting reduction to bank premises and equipment.

Nonperforming portfolio loans and leases were $618 million in the current quarter, with the resulting NPL ratio of 0.56%. NPLs included an $83 million unfavorable impact due to the aforementioned accounting policy change, or 7 bps to the NPL ratio. Compared to the year-ago quarter, NPLs increased $270 million with the NPL ratio increasing 19 bps. Compared to the prior quarter, NPLs increased $136 million with the NPL ratio increasing 12 bps.  

Nonperforming portfolio assets were $680 million in the current quarter, with the resulting NPA ratio of 0.62%. NPAs included a $113 million unfavorable impact due to the aforementioned accounting policy changes, or 10 bps to the NPA ratio. Compared to the year-ago quarter, NPAs increased $285 million with the NPA ratio increasing 21 bps. Compared to the prior quarter, NPAs increased $161 million, or with the NPA ratio increasing 15 bps.  

The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $172 million in the current quarter, which included a $9 million unfavorable impact due to the aforementioned accounting policy change. The provision for loan and lease losses increased $77 million compared to the year-ago quarter, and $45 million compared to the prior quarter. The allowance for loan and lease losses ratio represented 1.10% of total portfolio loans and leases outstanding in the current quarter, compared with 1.16% in the year-ago quarter and 1.04% in the prior quarter. The allowance for loan and lease losses represented 194% of nonperforming portfolio loans and leases in the current quarter. The allowance for loan and lease losses represented 177% of nonperforming portfolio assets in the current quarter.  

Net charge-offs were $113 million in the current quarter, with the resulting NCO ratio of 0.41%. NCOs included a $10 million unfavorable impact due to the aforementioned accounting policy changes, or 4 bps to the NCO ratio. Compared to the year-ago quarter, net charge-offs increased $30 million and the NCO ratio increased 6 bps. Compared to the prior quarter, net charge-offs increased $14 million and the NCO ratio increased 5 bps.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Tier I risk-based capital ratio was 10.99%, the Total risk-based capital ratio was 13.84%, and the Tier I leverage ratio was 9.54%.  

On October 25, 2019, Fifth Third initially settled a share repurchase agreement whereby Fifth Third would purchase $300 million of its outstanding stock. The initial settlement reduced third quarter common shares outstanding by 9.0 million shares. On December 17, 2019, Fifth Third settled the forward contract, which resulted in an additional 1.1 million shares repurchased in connection with the completion of this agreement.

Tax Rate  

The effective tax rate was 22.0% compared with 22.4% in the year-ago quarter and 20.2% in the prior quarter.  

Other  

On December 27, 2019, Fifth Third Bancorp entered into a transaction with FIS and Worldpay which grants each of Fifth Third Bancorp and Worldpay the ability to terminate and settle certain cash flows payable under Fifth Third Bancorp’s Tax Receivable Agreement with Worldpay. Under the TRA transaction, Worldpay may be obligated to pay up to a total of approximately $366 million to Fifth Third Bancorp to terminate and settle certain remaining cash flows Fifth Third Bancorp expected to receive under the TRA in the years 2021 to 2035, totaling an estimated $720 million. If exercised, certain of the obligations would be settled with four quarterly payments beginning in April 2020, a second set of the obligations would be settled with four quarterly payments beginning in April 2022, and a third set of the obligations would be settled with four quarterly payments beginning in April 2023. Fifth Third Bancorp recognized a pre-tax gain and corresponding receivable of $345 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 associated with these options.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

In addition to GAAP measures, management considers various Non-GAAP measures when evaluating the performance of the business, including: “net interest income (FTE),” “interest income (FTE),” “net interest margin (FTE),” “net interest rate spread (FTE),” “income before income taxes (FTE),” “tangible net income available to common shareholders,” “average tangible common equity,” “return on average tangible common equity,” “tangible common equity (excluding AOCI),” “tangible common equity (including AOCI),” “tangible equity,” “tangible book value per share,” “adjusted noninterest income,” “adjusted noninterest expense,” “pre-provision net revenue,” “adjusted efficiency ratio,” “adjusted return on average common equity,” “adjusted return on average tangible common equity,” “adjusted return on average tangible common equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income,” “adjusted net interest margin,” “adjusted pre-provision net revenue,” “adjusted return on average assets,” “efficiency ratio (FTE),” “total revenue (FTE),” and certain ratios derived from these measures. The Bancorp believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because these are among the measures used by the Fifth Third management team to evaluate operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions.  

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and net interest margin as they provide a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.  

The Bancorp believes tangible net income available to common shareholders, average tangible common equity, tangible common equity (excluding AOCI), tangible common equity (including AOCI), tangible equity, tangible book value per share and return on average tangible common equity are important measures for evaluating the performance of the business without the impacts of intangible items, whether acquired or created internally, compared to other companies in the industry who present similar measures.  

The Bancorp believes noninterest income, noninterest expense, net interest income, net interest margin, pre-provision net revenue, efficiency ratio, return on average common equity, return on average tangible common equity, and return on average assets are important measures that adjust for significant, unusual, or large transactions that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of on-going financial performance and enhances comparability of results with prior periods.  

Management considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity and tangible common equity (including and excluding AOCI), in addition to capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the U.S. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. These ratios are not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be Non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that providing the tangible common equity ratio excluding AOCI on certain assets and liabilities enables investors and others to assess the Bancorp’s use of equity without the effects of changes in AOCI some of which are uncertain and providing the tangible common equity ratio including AOCI enables investors and others to assess the Bancorp’s use of equity if components of AOCI, such as unrealized gains or losses, were to be monetized.  

Please note that although Non-GAAP financial measures provide useful insight, they should not be considered in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for analysis using GAAP measures.  

Please see Reg. G reconciliations of all historical Non-GAAP measures used in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, beginning on the following page.
