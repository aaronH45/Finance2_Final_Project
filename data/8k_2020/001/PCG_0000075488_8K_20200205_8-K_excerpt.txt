Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 

As previously disclosed, on January 29, 2019 (the “Petition Date”), PG&E Corporation and its subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the “Utility,” and together with PG&E Corporation, the “Debtors”), filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 (“Chapter 11”) of the United States Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Debtors’ Chapter 11 cases are being jointly administered under the caption In re: PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Case No. 19-30088 (DM) (the “Chapter 11 Cases”). On January 31, 2020, the Debtors filed an amendment to the Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization dated December 12, 2019 (as amended, the “Proposed Plan”). 

Also as previously disclosed, on January 22, 2020, the Debtors entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the “RSA”) with certain holders of senior unsecured debt of the Utility (the “Initial Consenting Noteholders”) and the Shareholder Proponents (as defined therein). Thereafter, as previously disclosed, the Debtors entered into Joinder Agreements with additional holders of senior unsecured debt of the Utility (the “Additional Consenting Noteholders,” and, together with the Initial Consenting Noteholders, the “Consenting Noteholders”) under which each Additional Consenting Noteholder agreed to join and be bound by the terms of the RSA.  

On February 5, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the RSA (the “RSA Approval Order”). 

Under the terms of the RSA, the Debtors have agreed to pay to each Consenting Noteholder that holds Utility Impaired Senior Note Claims (as defined in the RSA) and has become a Consenting Noteholder prior to entry of the RSA Approval Order and remains a Consenting Noteholder as of the effective date, a pro-rated share of an underwriting fee equal to $63 million in the aggregate. The pro-rated share of such underwriting fee will be based on the amount of Utility Impaired Senior Note Claims held by Consenting Noteholders as of the close of business on February 5, 2020, the date of the entry of the RSA Approval Order (the “RSA Approval Order Date”). 

Consenting Noteholders informed PG&E Corporation that, as of the RSA Approval Order Date, they held, in the aggregate, (i) $5.89 billion (approximately 95%) of the aggregate principal amount of Utility Impaired Senior Note Claims and (ii) $1.43 billion (approximately 82%) of the aggregate principal amount of Utility Short-Term Senior Note Claims (as defined in the RSA).  

Any description of the RSA or the Joinder Agreements thereto is qualified in its entirety by reference to the information provided in the Debtors’ Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 22, 2019 and the complete copies of the RSA and Form of Joinder Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 thereto, which are incorporated herein by reference.
