ST. PAUL, Minn. – Jan. 28, 2020 − 3M (NYSE: MMM) today reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 results and provided its 2020 earnings outlook.

Roman continued, “We also continue to build for the future, including the launch of our new global operating model which represents the next phase of our transformation journey. As a result of our actions, we are well positioned to improve our performance, return to growth and deliver a successful 2020.” 

Fourth-Quarter Results 

Sales grew 2.1 percent year-on-year to $8.1 billion. Organic local-currency sales declined 2.6 percent while acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 5.1 percent. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 0.4 percent year-on-year. 

Total sales grew 25.4 percent in Health Care, were flat in Consumer, with declines of 4.8 percent in Safety and Industrial, and 6.2 percent in Transportation and Electronics. Organic local-currency sales increased 0.2 percent in Consumer, with declines of 0.2 percent in Health Care, 2.8 percent in Safety and Industrial, and 5.9 percent in Transportation and Electronics. 

On a geographic basis, total sales grew 7.4 percent in the U.S., 1.2 percent in Latin America/Canada, with declines of 1.7 percent in Asia Pacific and 2.0 percent in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa). Organic local-currency sales were flat in Latin America/Canada, with declines of 2.7 percent in both Asia Pacific and EMEA and 2.9 percent in the U.S. 

Fourth-quarter GAAP earnings were $1.66 per share, a decrease of 27 percent year-on-year. This result includes the company’s previously mentioned pre-tax restructuring charge of $134 million, or $0.20 per share, and a significant litigation-related pre-tax charge of $214 million, or $0.29 per share. Neither of these items was included in 3M’s prior earnings guidance. Fourth-quarter 2018 GAAP earnings were $2.27 per share which included a net charge for tax adjustments of $0.04 per share related to both the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and its first-quarter 2018 legal settlement, and a $0.02 per share net benefit from a divestiture gain, net of actions. 

Excluding the impact of the significant litigation-related charges, fourth quarter 2019 adjusted earnings were $1.95 per share versus $2.31 per share in the fourth quarter 2018, adjusting for last year’s tax-related items, as referenced in the “Supplemental Financial Information Non-GAAP Measures” section. 

Fourth-quarter operating income was $1.3 billion with operating margins of 16.3 percent. These results include a combined negative operating income impact of $348 million, or a minus 4.3 percentage point operating margin impact, from the company’s restructuring and significant litigation-related charges. 

The company’s operating cash flow was $2.3 billion, contributing to conversion of 186 percent of net income to free cash flow, as referenced in the “Supplemental Financial Information Non-GAAP Measures” section. 

3M paid $828 million in cash dividends to shareholders and repurchased $164 million of its own shares during the quarter. 

Accelerating the Pace of 3M’s Transformation Journey 

Today, 3M announced the next step in its transformation journey, which includes a new global operating model and streamlined organizational structure. 

As a result of these actions, 3M initiated a restructuring that will reduce approximately 1,500 positions, spanning all business groups, functions and geographies. On a pre-tax basis, 3M took a restructuring charge of $134 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The company expects annual pre-tax savings of $110 million to $120 million, with $40 million to $50 million in 2020. 

3M today issued a separate press release with more details on these changes. 

Significant Litigation-Related PFAS Update 

During the fourth quarter, 3M updated its evaluation of customer-related PFAS (Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances) litigation based on continued, productive settlement discussions with multiple parties. As previously disclosed, 3M has been engaged in mediation and resolution negotiations in multiple cases. 

In addition, during the fourth quarter the company updated its assessment of environmental matters and litigation related to its historical PFAS manufacturing operations and expanded its evaluation of other 3M sites that may have used certain PFAS-containing material and locations at which they were disposed. 

As a result of these actions during the fourth quarter, the company recorded a significant litigation-related pre-tax charge of $214 million, or $0.29 cents per share.

Full-Year 2019 Results 

Full-year 2019 GAAP earnings were $7.81 per share, a decrease of 12 percent. During the year, the company recorded charges totaling $1.29 per share for significant litigation-related charges and the deconsolidation of the company’s Venezuelan subsidiary. Full-year 2018 GAAP earnings were $8.89 per share, which included charges totaling $1.57 per share for significant litigation-related charges and measurement period accounting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). 

Excluding the above items, 2019 adjusted earnings were $9.10 per share versus 2018 adjusted earnings of $10.46, as referenced in the “Supplemental Financial Information Non-GAAP Measures” section. During 2019, the company recorded an earnings benefit of $0.21 per share from the divestiture of its gas and flame detection business. In 2018, the company recorded an earnings benefit of $0.50 per share from the divestiture of its communication markets business, net of related restructuring actions. 

Sales declined 1.9 percent to $32.1 billion with an organic local-currency sales decline of 1.5 percent. The combination of acquisitions and divestitures increased sales 1.3 percent. Foreign currency translation decreased sales 1.7 percent. Full-year operating income margins were 19.2 percent, while adjusted operating margins were 21.6 percent. 

The company’s operating cash flow was $7.1 billion, contributing to conversion of 118 percent of net income to free cash flow for the year. In addition, 3M generated 17.5 percent return on invested capital. Refer to the “Supplemental Financial Information Non-GAAP Measures” section. The net impact from significant litigation-related charges, Venezuela deconsolidation, and gas and flame detection business divestiture gain increased full-year free cash flow conversion by 9 percentage points and reduced return on invested capital by 2 percentage points. 

For the full year, 3M paid $3.3 billion in cash dividends to shareholders and repurchased $1.4 billion of its own shares. 

Full-Year 2020 Outlook

 (a)Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they function as useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (b)Net debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be an important indicator of liquidity and a guiding measure of capital structure strategy.

 (c)Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation.

 (d)In 2019, the Company recorded significant litigation-related charges of $762 million ($590 million after tax) related to PFAS (certain perfluorinated compounds) matters and coal mine dust respirator mask lawsuits of which $214 million ($166 million after tax) occurred in the fourth quarter. In 2018, 3M recorded significant litigation-related charges of $897 million ($770 million after tax) related to PFAS matters of which a tax expense of $60 million occurred in the fourth quarter. In the second quarter of 2019, 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $162 million related to deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary. During 2018, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $176 related to measurement period adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in 2017 from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), of which a tax benefit of $41 million occurred in the fourth quarter.

 In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impacts of significant litigation-related charges, deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary and measurement period adjustments to the enactment of the TCJA. These items represent significant amounts that impacted the Company’s financial results. Operating income, income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing the Company’s operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for these items is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends. The determination of these items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

(Dollars in millions) 

(Unaudited) 

Effective in the second quarter of 2019, to enable the Company to better serve global customers and markets, the Company made the following changes to its business segments: 

Realignment of the Company’s business segments from five to four 

The Company realigned its former five business segments into four: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. Existing divisions were largely realigned to this new structure. In addition, certain retail auto care product lines formerly in the Automotive Aftermarket Division (now within the Safety and Industrial business segment) were moved to the Construction and Home Improvement Division (within the Consumer business segment). Also, product lines relating to the refrigeration filtration business, formerly included in the Separation and Purification Sciences Division (now within the Health Care business segment) were moved to Other Safety and Industrial (within the Safety and Industrial business segment). 3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and operating income. Dual credit, which is based on which business segment provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country, was reduced as a result of the closer alignment between customer account activity and their respective markets. The four business segments are as follows:

 Safety and Industrial: This segment includes businesses that serve the global industrial, electrical and safety markets. This business segment consists of personal safety, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives, closure and masking systems, electrical markets, automotive aftermarket, and roofing granules. This segment also includes the Communication Markets Division (which was substantially sold in 2018) and the refrigeration filtration product lines (within Other Safety and Industrial).

 Transportation and Electronics: This segment includes businesses that serve global transportation and electronic original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. This business segment consists of electronics (display materials and systems, electronic materials solutions), automotive and aerospace, commercial solutions, advanced materials, and transportation safety.

 Health Care: This business segment serves the global healthcare industry and includes medical solutions, oral care, separation and purification sciences, health information systems, drug delivery systems, and food safety.

 Consumer: This business serves global consumers and consists of home improvement, stationery and office supplies, home care, and consumer health care. This segment also includes, within the Construction and Home Improvement Division, certain retail auto care product lines. 

In addition, as part of 3M’s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers, the Company made the following changes, effective in the first quarter of 2019, and other revisions impacting business segment reporting: 

Continued alignment of customer account activity 

As part of 3M’s regular customer-focus initiatives, the Company realigned certain customer account activity (“sales district”) to correlate with the primary divisional product offerings in various countries and reduce complexity for customers when interacting with multiple 3M businesses. This largely impacted the amount of dual credit certain business segments receive as a result of sales district attribution. 3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in a specific country. 

Creation of Closure and Masking Systems Division and Medical Solutions Division 

3M created the Closure and Masking Systems Division, which combines the masking tape, packaging tape and personal care portfolios formerly within Industrial Adhesives and Tapes Division in the former Industrial business segment into a separate division also within the former Industrial business segment. 3M created the Medical Solutions Division in the Health Care business segment, which combines the former Critical and Chronic Care Division and Infection Prevention Division (which were also both within the Health Care business segment).

Additional actions impacting business segment reporting 

The business associated with certain safety products sold through retail channels in the Asia Pacific region was realigned from the Personal Safety Division within the former Safety and Graphics business segment to the Construction and Home Improvement Division within the Consumer business segment. In addition, certain previously non-allocated costs related to manufacturing and technology of centrally managed material resource centers of expertise within Corporate and Unallocated are now reflected as being allocated to the business segments. 

The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. Refer to 3M’s Current Reports on Form 8-K furnished on March 8, 2019 and May 30, 2019, for additional supplemental unaudited historical business segment net sales and operating income information.
