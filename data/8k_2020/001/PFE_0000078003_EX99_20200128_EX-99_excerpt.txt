Acquisitions and the contribution of Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare business to the GSK Consumer Healthcare joint venture (JV) that were completed during 2019 impacted financial results in the periods presented(1). Some amounts in this press release may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts. References to operational variances pertain to period-over-period growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange(8).

2020 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE(9) 

2020 financial guidance for Total Company(4) is presented below. Total Company(4) financial guidance reflects a full year of revenue and expense contributions from Biopharma and Upjohn.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Financial guidance for Adjusted diluted EPS(3) assumes no share repurchases in 2020.

A reconciliation of Pfizer’s full-year 2019 revenues to 2019 revenues excluding the partial-year revenue contribution from the Consumer Healthcare(1) segment is presented below. Also presented below is a comparison of full-year 2019 results excluding the revenue contribution from the Consumer Healthcare(1) segment to Pfizer’s 2020 Total Company(4) financial guidance for revenues and Adjusted diluted EPS(3) at 2019 foreign exchange rates and at mid-January 2020 foreign exchange rates.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Upon the closing of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction(1) in third-quarter 2019, Pfizer deconsolidated its Consumer Healthcare segment, which resulted in a shift from recording revenue and expense contributions from the Consumer Healthcare segment to Pfizer recording its pro rata share of the earnings generated by the Consumer Healthcare JV(1) in Adjusted other (income)/deductions(3) on a one-quarter lag. Therefore, full-year 2019 revenues reflect seven months of Consumer Healthcare segment domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare segment international operations. Full-year 2019 Adjusted diluted EPS(3) likewise reflects seven 

- 2 -

months of domestic segment operations and eight months of international segment operations as well as Pfizer’s pro rata share of two months of the Consumer Healthcare JV’s earnings generated in third-quarter 2019, which were recorded in Pfizer’s Adjusted other (income)/deductions(3) in fourth-quarter 2019.

2020 financial guidance for Total Company(4) Adjusted other (income)/deductions(3) and Adjusted diluted EPS(3) reflects Pfizer’s share of the JV’s earnings that were generated in fourth-quarter 2019 (to be recorded by Pfizer in first-quarter 2020) as well as Pfizer’s share of the JV’s projected earnings during the first three quarters of 2020.

Shift from Biopharma to Upjohn of Meridian Medical Technologies (Meridian) and the Pfizer-Mylan Strategic Collaboration in Japan (Mylan-Japan)(10) 

Beginning in 2020, Upjohn began managing Pfizer’s Meridian subsidiary, the manufacturer of EpiPen and other auto-injector products, and the Mylan-Japan collaboration for generic drugs in Japan (established in 2012). As a result, revenues and expenses associated with Meridian and Mylan-Japan will be reported in Pfizer’s Upjohn business beginning in first-quarter 2020. In 2019, revenues from Meridian and Mylan-Japan were recorded in Pfizer’s Biopharma business and totaled $598 million, flat operationally, compared with full-year 2018.

2020 Financial Guidance for New Pfizer(5)

EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY

Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “2019 was a busy year, highlighted by solid financial performance, shareholder-friendly capital allocation, the strengthening of our pipeline as well as the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV with GSK. We also announced a definitive agreement to combine Upjohn and Mylan to create a new global pharmaceutical company, Viatris, marking an important milestone in Pfizer’s evolution toward becoming a more focused, global leader in innovative medicines.

“2020 is expected to be an exciting year for Pfizer with the close of the Upjohn-Mylan transaction anticipated by mid-year, leaving New Pfizer positioned to deliver revenue and Adjusted diluted EPS(3) growth that is expected to be among the industry leaders. New Pfizer will be a smaller, science-based company with a singular focus on innovation while also continuing to allocate significant capital directly to shareholders, primarily through dividends.

“For New Pfizer, we expect important clinical data readouts across our early-, mid- and late-stage pipeline. In the first half of 2020, we expect to report pivotal top-line results for the JADE Compare study for abrocitinib (PF-04965842), our Janus kinase-1 (JAK1) inhibitor for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), for three Phase 3 trials of PF-06482077, our 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate in adults aged 18 and older, and for Xeljanz in ankylosing spondylitis, in addition to the potentially registration-enabling Phase 2 ANCHOR study evaluating the combination of Braftovi, Mektovi and cetuximab for the first-line treatment of BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer. We also expect data in the first half of 2020 for promising earlier-stage opportunities, including proof-of-concept readouts for PF-06939926, our mini-dystrophin gene therapy candidate for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, for PF-06928316, our prophylactic vaccine candidate for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and for PF-06700841, an investigational topical TYK2/JAK1 dual inhibitor for psoriasis and AD.

“In the second half of 2020, we look forward to top-line results for the Phase 3 PENELOPE-B study of Ibrance in early-stage breast cancer as well as for proof-of-concept readouts for PF-06651600, our dual JAK3/TEC inhibitor as a potential treatment for vitiligo, for PF-06700841 for potential treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and for PF-06826647, our investigational TYK2 inhibitor for psoriasis. In addition, we now expect the Phase 3 PALLAS study of Ibrance in early-stage breast cancer to complete in early 2021. In 2020, we are focused on accelerating the pipeline and building on the business momentum that we generated in 2019,” Dr. Bourla concluded.

Frank D’Amelio, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Business Operations and Global Supply, stated, “I am pleased with our 2019 financial results, which met or exceeded all components of our financial guidance. Our Biopharma business generated 8% operational revenue growth, driven by strong growth from Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz and Vyndaqel/Vyndamax. As expected, the Upjohn business declined 16% operationally, primarily reflecting the U.S. loss of exclusivity of Lyrica in July 2019. Excluding Lyrica in the U.S. and the 

- 5 -

impact of other recent product losses of exclusivity, Upjohn revenues declined 3% operationally in 2019. We also returned $16.9 billion directly to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, demonstrating our continued commitment to returning capital to our shareholders.

“Today we also provided 2020 financial guidance for Total Company(4), New Pfizer(5) and Upjohn(6). The midpoint of the revenue guidance range for New Pfizer(5) implies 8% operational growth and reflects anticipated continued strong growth from certain in-line brands such as Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Xtandi and Inlyta, from recent and expected product launches such as Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, Braftovi, Mektovi and oncology biosimilars as well as from emerging markets. Since July 2019, several of the aforementioned products have performed better than we had anticipated and have generated strong momentum that we expect to continue in 2020. The midpoint of the revenue guidance range for Upjohn(6) implies a 23% operational decline, primarily reflecting expected declines for products that have recently lost marketing exclusivity and lower revenues from China due to the geographic expansion of the volume-based procurement (VBP) program to all Chinese provinces in 2020. Importantly, the financial guidance for Upjohn(6) remains unchanged on an operational basis from the preliminary financial targets that were provided in July 2019,” Mr. D’Amelio concluded.

QUARTERLY FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Fourth-Quarter 2019 vs. Fourth-Quarter 2018) 

Fourth-quarter 2019 revenues totaled $12.7 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion, or 9%, compared to the prior-year quarter, reflecting an operational decline of $1.1 billion, or 8%, as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $158 million, or 1%.

Biopharma Revenue Highlights

Fourth-quarter 2019 Biopharma revenues totaled $10.5 billion, up 9% operationally, primarily driven by:

▪Eliquis globally, up 22% operationally, primarily driven by continued increased adoption in non-valvular atrial fibrillation as well as oral anti-coagulant market share gains;

▪Vyndaqel/Vyndamax global revenues were $213 million, driven by:

–the U.S. launches of Vyndaqel in May 2019 and Vyndamax in September 2019 for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM); and

–180% operational growth in international markets, primarily driven by the March 2019 launch of the ATTR-CM indication in Japan and continued uptake for the transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy indication in developed Europe;

- 6 -

▪Ibrance globally, up 15% operationally, primarily driven by:

–14% growth in the U.S., primarily driven by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) class market share growth and Ibrance’s continued CDK market share leadership in its approved metastatic breast cancer indications; and

–17% operational growth in international markets, reflecting continued strong uptake following launches primarily in certain emerging markets;

▪the Hospital business in the U.S. and emerging markets, collectively up 8% operationally, primarily driven by continued growth from anti-infective products in China as well as the November 2018 U.S. launch of Panzyga and U.S. revenue growth from Pfizer CentreOne, Pfizer’s contract manufacturing business;

▪Prevenar 13 in emerging markets, up 27% operationally, primarily reflecting the overall favorable impact of timing associated with government purchases for the pediatric indication compared with the prior-year quarter, as well as continued pediatric uptake in China;

▪Inlyta in the U.S., up 249%, primarily driven by increased uptake resulting from the second-quarter 2019 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for combinations of certain immune checkpoint inhibitors plus Inlyta for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC);

▪Xeljanz globally, up 11% operationally, primarily driven by:

–44% operational growth in international markets, reflecting continued uptake in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) indication as well as from the recent launch of the ulcerative colitis (UC) indication in certain developed markets; and

–1% growth in the U.S., reflecting continued volume growth from the 2018 launches of the UC and PsA indications offset by higher rebating from new commercial contracts; and

▪Xtandi in the U.S., up 29%, primarily driven by continued uptake in the metastatic and non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer indications,

partially offset primarily by lower revenues for:

▪Enbrel internationally, down 18% operationally, primarily reflecting continued biosimilar competition in most developed Europe markets; and

▪Prevnar 13 in the U.S., down 7%, reflecting the continued decline in revenues for the adult indication due to a declining “catch up” opportunity compared to the prior-year quarter.

- 7 -

Upjohn Revenue Highlights

Fourth-quarter 2019 Upjohn revenues totaled $2.2 billion, down 32% operationally, primarily driven by the expected significant volume declines for Lyrica in the U.S. due to multi-source generic competition that began in July 2019. Excluding the unfavorable impact of Lyrica in the U.S. and other recent product losses of exclusivity, fourth-quarter 2019 revenues for Upjohn declined 6% operationally.

Fourth-quarter 2019 Upjohn revenues in China declined 1% operationally, primarily driven by declines for Lipitor and Norvasc in provinces where the VBP program has been implemented, partially offset by products not impacted by the VBP implementation, including Celebrex and Viagra, as well as operational growth from Lipitor and Norvasc in provinces were VBP had not been implemented.

GAAP Reported(2) Income Statement Highlights

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Indicates calculation not meaningful.

Fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 Cost of Sales(2), SI&A Expenses(2) and R&D Expenses(2) were favorably impacted by the July 31, 2019 completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction with GSK(1).

Pfizer recorded lower other deductions––net(2) in fourth-quarter 2019 compared with the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by:

▪lower asset impairment charges of $2.7 billion in fourth-quarter 2019, primarily related to Eucrisa, which was acquired in connection with Pfizer’s 2016 acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc., compared to asset impairment charges of $3.1 billion in fourth-quarter 2018, primarily associated with generic sterile injectable products acquired in connection with Pfizer’s 2015 acquisition of Hospira, Inc.;

▪higher net gains on investments in equity securities;

▪lower business and legal entity alignment costs; and

- 8 -

▪lower net realized losses on sales of investments in debt securities,

partially offset primarily by:

▪higher charges for certain legal matters;

▪higher pension and other post-retirement benefit costs; and

▪higher net interest expense.

Pfizer’s effective tax rate on Reported income(2) for fourth-quarter 2019 compared to the prior-year quarter was favorably impacted primarily by:

▪benefits related to certain tax initiatives associated with the implementation of our new organizational structure; and

▪a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business,

partially offset primarily by:

▪a decrease in tax benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities; and

▪the non-recurrence of certain tax initiatives and favorable adjustments recorded in 2018 to the provisional estimate of the legislation in the U.S. commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

In addition to the aforementioned factors impacting Pfizer’s effective tax rate on Reported income(2) for fourth-quarter 2019, Pfizer’s full-year 2019 effective tax rate on Reported income(2) compared to the prior year was impacted primarily by:

▪a tax benefit related to the settlement of a U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit for multiple tax years,

partially offset primarily by:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Adjusted(3) Income Statement Highlights

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fourth-quarter 2019 diluted weighted-average shares outstanding used to calculate Adjusted(3) diluted EPS declined by 281 million shares compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to Pfizer’s share repurchase program, reflecting the impact of share repurchases during 2018 and 2019, partially offset by dilution related to share-based employee compensation programs.

A full reconciliation of Reported(2) to Adjusted(3) financial measures and associated footnotes can be found starting on page 25 of this press release.

FULL-YEAR REVENUE SUMMARY (Full-Year 2019 vs. Full-Year 2018)

Full-year 2019 revenues totaled $51.8 billion, a decrease of $1.9 billion, or 4%, compared to full-year 2018, reflecting an operational decline of $545 million, or 1%, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.4 billion, or 3%.

Biopharma Revenue Highlights

Full-year 2019 Biopharma revenues totaled $39.4 billion, up 8% operationally, primarily driven by:

▪continued uptake for Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz and Vyndaqel/Vyndamax globally;

▪Prevenar 13 in emerging markets; and

▪Inlyta in the U.S.,

partially offset primarily by lower revenues for:

▪Enbrel internationally; and

▪Prevnar 13 in the U.S.

- 10 -

Upjohn Revenue Highlights

Full-year 2019 Upjohn revenues totaled $10.2 billion, down 16% operationally, primarily driven by Lyrica in the U.S. due to multi-source generic competition that began in July 2019 and Viagra in the U.S. due to increased generic competition following its December 2017 patent expiration. Excluding the unfavorable impact of Lyrica in the U.S. and other recent product losses of exclusivity, full-year 2019 revenues for Upjohn declined 3% operationally.

Full-year 2019 Upjohn revenues in China grew 7% operationally, primarily driven by products not impacted by the VBP implementation, including Viagra, Celebrex, Zoloft and Lyrica, as well as by Lipitor and Norvasc in provinces where the VBP program had not been implemented, partially offset by revenue declines for Lipitor and Norvasc in provinces impacted by the March 2019 VBP program implementation.

Consumer Healthcare Revenue Highlights

Full-year 2019 revenues for Consumer Healthcare totaled $2.1 billion, down 40% operationally, reflecting the July 31, 2019 completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction with GSK(1). 

RECENT NOTABLE DEVELOPMENTS (Since October 29, 2019)

Product Developments

▪Abrilada/Amsparity (biosimilar adalimumab) 

–In December 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Amsparity as a biosimilar to Humira®(13) (adalimumab) for the treatment of certain patients with RA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, PsA, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, Crohn’s disease, UC, uveitis, and pediatric plaque psoriasis. The CHMP’s opinion is now under review by the European Commission (EC) with a final decision expected in the coming months. Pfizer does not currently plan to commercialize Amsparity in the EU should it be approved by the EC due to unfavorable market conditions.

–In November 2019, Pfizer announced that the FDA has approved Abrilada (adalimumab-afzb) as a biosimilar to Humira®(13) (adalimumab), for the treatment of certain patients with RA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, PsA, ankylosing spondylitis, adult Crohn’s disease, UC and plaque psoriasis. Pfizer is working to make Abrilada available to U.S. patients as soon as feasible based on the terms of its agreement with AbbVie. Current plans are to launch Abrilada in 2023.

- 11 -

▪Bavencio (avelumab)

–In January 2020, EMD Serono, the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany in the U.S. and Canada, and Pfizer announced that the Phase 3 JAVELIN Bladder 100 study met its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) at a planned interim analysis. In this study, patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease did not progress on induction chemotherapy and who were randomized to receive first-line maintenance therapy with Bavencio and best supportive care (BSC) lived significantly longer than those who received BSC only. A statistically significant improvement in OS was demonstrated in the Bavencio arm in each of the co-primary populations: all randomized patients and patients with PD-L1–positive tumors. The safety profile for Bavencio in the trial was consistent with that in the JAVELIN monotherapy clinical development program. The results of this study will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical congress and shared with the FDA and other health authorities.

–In November 2019, EMD Serono and Pfizer announced topline results of the Phase 3 JAVELIN Gastric 100 study evaluating avelumab as first-line maintenance therapy following induction chemotherapy in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer versus continuation of chemotherapy or BSC. While the study showed clinical activity for avelumab in this setting, it did not meet the primary endpoints of superior OS compared with the standard of care in the overall intent-to-treat population or the PD-L1–positive population. No new safety signals were observed, and the safety profile for avelumab in this trial was consistent with that observed in the overall JAVELIN clinical development program. The results of this study will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical congress.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

▪Eliquis (apixaban) -- In December 2019, the Bristol-Myers Squibb-Pfizer alliance announced results at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting (ASH Conference) for retrospective real-world data analyses reporting outcomes on the safety and effectiveness of Eliquis compared to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or warfarin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with active cancer. Results from the primary analysis showed that Eliquis use was associated with lower rates of major bleeding, clinically-relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding and recurrent VTE compared to LMWH. Eliquis was also associated with a lower rate of recurrent VTE and similar rates of major bleeding and CRNM bleeding compared to warfarin. In a second oral presentation at the ASH Conference, results from a subgroup 

- 12 -

analysis of the primary study were highlighted based on different levels of risk for developing recurrent VTE. Study findings were generally consistent with the primary analysis.

▪Vyndaqel (tafamidis) -- In December 2019, Pfizer announced that the CHMP of the EMA adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Vyndaqel, a once-daily 61 mg oral capsule, for the treatment of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with cardiomyopathy. The CHMP’s opinion is now under review by the EC with a final decision expected in coming months.

▪Xeljanz (tofacitinib)

–In December 2019, Pfizer announced that the FDA approved Xeljanz XR extended-release 11 mg and 22 mg tablets for the once-daily treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active UC, after an inadequate response or intolerance to TNF blockers.

–In November 2019, Pfizer announced that the CHMP of the EMA adopted a final opinion following the re-evaluation of the benefit/risk of the three approved indications of Xeljanz in the European Union (EU). This re-evaluation was initiated following Pfizer’s initial announcement regarding the increased occurrence of pulmonary embolism and an increase in overall mortality with Xeljanz 10 mg twice daily found in an ongoing postmarketing requirement study (A3921133) in RA patients 50 years of age or older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor. The CHMP opinion was forwarded to the EC which is expected to issue, by the end of January 2020 or in February 2020, a final legally binding decision applicable in all EU Member States. The EMA recommended that Xeljanz should be used with caution in patients at high risk of blood clots. In addition, maintenance doses of 10 mg twice daily are not recommended in patients with UC who are at high risk of blood clots unless there is no suitable alternative treatment. Five mg twice daily should not be exceeded for RA or PsA. Patients should be advised of the risk of VTE and should seek immediate medical treatment if symptoms develop during treatment. Further, the EMA is recommending that, due to increased risk of infections, patients older than 65 years of age should be treated with Xeljanz only when there is no suitable alternative treatment. The recommendations in this final CHMP opinion replace the provisional measures put in place at the start of the review in May 2019 which contraindicated the 10 mg twice daily dose of Xeljanz for patients at high risk of blood clots in the lungs. The CHMP is recommending removal of that contraindication. The changes come into force when the EC issues its decision.

–In November 2019, Pfizer presented positive results from a Phase 3 investigational study of tofacitinib in children and adolescents aged two to less than 18 with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pa-JIA) during a late-breaking oral presentation at the American College of Rheumatology/Association of Rheumatology Professionals Annual Meeting. The trial met its primary endpoint showing that in patients with pa-JIA, the occurrence of disease flare in patients treated with tofacitinib was significantly lower than patients treated with placebo at week 44. The most common adverse events in this study in any treatment group were upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis, nausea, pyrexia, 

- 13 -

disease progression, vomiting and pa-JIA. There were no cases of death, major adverse cardiovascular events, malignancies, thrombosis, opportunistic infection or tuberculosis. Pfizer intends to submit regulatory applications for this indication in 2020.

▪Xtandi (enzalutamide) -- In December 2019, Astellas Pharma Inc. and Pfizer announced that the FDA approved a sNDA for Xtandi for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). In 2019, it is estimated that just over 40,000 men in the U.S. are living with mCSPC, a form of prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and still responds to a medical or surgical treatment that lowers testosterone.

Pipeline Developments

A comprehensive update of Pfizer’s development pipeline was published today and is now available at www.pfizer.com/science/drug-product-pipeline. It includes an overview of Pfizer’s research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication and phase of development, as well as mechanism of action for some candidates in Phase 1 and all candidates from Phase 2 through registration.

▪PF-07055480 (SB-525) -- In December 2019, in a poster presentation at the ASH Conference, Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. and Pfizer presented updated follow-up results from the Phase 1/2 Alta study evaluating investigational SB-525 gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia A. The data showed that SB-525 was generally well tolerated and demonstrated sustained increased Factor VIII levels following treatment with SB-525 through to 44 weeks, the extent of follow-up for the longest treated patient in the 3e13 vg/kg dose cohort. In addition, the manufacturing technology transfer and the transfer of the Investigational New Drug application to Pfizer were completed in fourth-quarter 2019.

Corporate Developments

▪In December 2019, Pfizer and Theravance Biopharma Ireland Limited, a subsidiary of Theravance Biopharma, Inc. (Theravance Biopharma) announced that the companies have entered into a global license agreement for Theravance Biopharma’s preclinical program for skin-targeted, locally-acting pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors that can be rapidly metabolized. The compounds in this program target validated pro-inflammatory pathways and are specifically designed to possess skin-selective activity with minimal systemic exposure. Under the terms of the agreement, Theravance Biopharma received an upfront cash payment of $10 million and is eligible to receive up to an additional $240 million in development and sales milestone payments from Pfizer. In addition, Theravance Biopharma will be eligible to receive royalties on worldwide net sales of any potential products emerging from the program.

▪In December 2019, Pfizer and Mylan N.V. (Mylan) announced that Ian Read, Pfizer’s former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and James Kilts, a Pfizer director since 2007, will join the board of directors of Viatris, the company to be formed by the planned combination of Mylan and Upjohn, upon completion of the 

- 14 -

transaction, which is anticipated to occur in mid-2020. As previously announced, upon the completion of the transaction, Robert J. Coury will serve as the Executive Chairman of the Viatris board and Michael Goettler, current Group President, Upjohn, will serve as Chief Executive Officer and board member. Also, as previously announced, Ian Read retired from Pfizer’s board on December 31, 2019. James Kilts will cease being a member of Pfizer’s board immediately upon the closing of the transaction.

▪In December 2019, Pfizer announced plans to host an Investor Day to showcase the company’s mid-to-late-stage R&D pipeline progress and commercial momentum across its Biopharma businesses, to be held on Tuesday, March 31, 2020 at its global headquarters in New York, NY. Pfizer business executives and scientific leadership will provide updates on the company’s progress in advancing its R&D pipeline, specifically on product candidates with blockbuster potential that are expected to launch by 2025.

(1)The following acquisitions and divestitures impacted financial results for the periods presented: 

▪On July 31, 2019, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) completed a transaction that combined the two companies’ respective consumer healthcare businesses into a joint venture (JV), operating under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. In exchange for contributing its Consumer Healthcare business to the JV, Pfizer received a 32% equity stake in the JV and GSK owns the remaining 68% of the JV. Upon the closing of the transaction, Pfizer deconsolidated its Consumer Healthcare business and recognized a pre-tax gain of $8.1 billion ($5.4 billion net of tax) in third-quarter 2019, reflecting the difference in the fair value of Pfizer’s 32% equity stake in the JV and the carrying value of its Consumer Healthcare business. In accordance with Pfizer’s domestic and international reporting periods(7), Pfizer’s financial results, and our Consumer Healthcare segment’s operating results, for full-year 2019 reflect seven months of Consumer Healthcare segment domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare segment international operations. Pfizer records its share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions––net commencing from August 1, 2019. Therefore, Pfizer recorded its share of two months of the JV’s earnings generated in third-quarter 2019 in Pfizer’s operating results in fourth-quarter 2019.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

▪On July 1, 2019, Pfizer announced the successful completion of its acquisition of the privately held clinical-stage biotechnology company, Therachon Holding AG.

charges or net gains and losses on investments in equity securities, but which management does not believe are reflective of ongoing core operations). Adjusted cost of sales, Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses, Adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses and Adjusted other (income)/deductions are income statement line items prepared on the same basis as, and therefore components of, the overall Adjusted income measure. As described in the Financial Review––Non-GAAP Financial Measure (Adjusted Income) section of Pfizer’s 2018 Financial Report, which was filed as Exhibit 13 to Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, management uses Adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. Because Adjusted income is an important internal measurement for Pfizer, management believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. Pfizer reports Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income, and Adjusted diluted EPS in order to portray the results of the company’s major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines and vaccines––prior to considering certain income statement elements. See the accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted information for the fourth quarter and full year of 2019 and 2018. The Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS.

(4)Financial guidance for Total Company reflects a full-year 2020 contribution from Biopharma and Upjohn, the current construct of the company, and excludes any impact from the pending Upjohn combination with Mylan. 

(5)Financial guidance for New Pfizer reflects a full-year 2020 pro forma view of the company assuming the pending Upjohn combination with Mylan was completed at the beginning of 2020. Therefore, New Pfizer reflects contributions from the Biopharma business as it is presently being managed, which excludes contributions from Pfizer’s Meridian subsidiary and the Pfizer-Mylan strategic collaboration in Japan (Mylan-Japan). Pfizer’s Meridian subsidiary and Mylan-Japan were managed by Pfizer’s Biopharma business in 2019. Financial guidance for New Pfizer also includes the full-year effect of the following items that assume the completion of the Upjohn combination with Mylan:

▪$12 billion of net proceeds from Upjohn to be retained by Pfizer, which Pfizer will use to repay its own existing indebtedness; and

▪other transaction-related items, such as income from transition services agreements between Pfizer and Viatris. 

In addition, 2020 financial guidance for New Pfizer Adjusted IBT Margin(11) and Adjusted diluted EPS(3) reflects Pfizer’s share of the earnings generated by the Consumer Healthcare JV(1) in fourth-quarter 2019 

- 17 -

(to be recorded by Pfizer in first-quarter 2020) as well as Pfizer’s share of the JV’s projected earnings during the first three quarters of 2020.

(6)Financial guidance for Upjohn assumes a full-year 2020 contribution from the Upjohn business as it is presently being managed, which includes contributions from Pfizer’s Meridian subsidiary and the Pfizer-Mylan strategic collaboration in Japan (Mylan-Japan). Pfizer’s Meridian subsidiary and Mylan-Japan were managed by Pfizer’s Biopharma business in 2019. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(8)References to operational variances in this press release pertain to period-over-period growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange. The operational variances are determined by multiplying or dividing, as appropriate, the current period U.S. dollar results by the current period average foreign exchange rates and then multiplying or dividing, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year period average foreign exchange rates. Although exchange rate changes are part of Pfizer’s business, they are not within Pfizer’s control. Exchange rate changes, however, can mask positive or negative trends in the business; therefore, Pfizer believes presenting operational variances provides useful information in evaluating the results of its business.

(9)Pfizer does not provide guidance for GAAP Reported financial measures (other than revenues) or a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP Reported financial measures on a forward-looking basis because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, net gains or losses on investments in equity securities and potential future asset impairments without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP Reported results for the guidance period. 

The 2020 financial guidance for Total Company reflects the following: 

▪Does not assume the completion of any business development transactions not completed as of December 31, 2019, including any one-time upfront payments associated with such transactions. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

- 18 -

of the JV’s earnings that were generated in fourth-quarter 2019 (to be recorded by Pfizer in first-quarter 2020) as well as Pfizer’s share of the JV’s projected earnings during first three quarters of 2020.

▪Reflects an anticipated negative revenue impact of $2.4 billion due to recent and expected generic and biosimilar competition for certain products that have recently lost or are anticipated to soon lose patent protection. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(10)Pfizer, Upjohn and Mylan are in the process of negotiating the terms on which Pfizer would transfer the Meridian business and/or certain Pfizer assets that currently form part of the Mylan-Japan collaboration to Viatris following the completion of the proposed combination of Upjohn and Mylan. There can be no assurance that any agreement or transaction will result from these negotiations and if the parties are unsuccessful in their efforts to negotiate the terms of such potential transactions, the Meridian business and/or the Pfizer assets that currently form part of the Mylan-Japan collaboration will remain with Pfizer. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(12)Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is defined as reported U.S. GAAP net income/(loss)(2), and its components, adjusted for interest expense, provision/(benefit) for taxes on income/(loss) and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items (some of which may recur, such as gains on the completion of joint venture transactions, restructuring charges, legal charges or net gains and losses on investments in equity securities, but which management does not believe are reflective of ongoing core operations). Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes this performance measure supplements investors’ and other readers’ understanding and assessment of the 

- 19 -

financial performance of Upjohn. Adjusted EBITDA as defined is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss)(2) or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with GAAP.

On July 31, 2019, we completed the transaction in which we and GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new consumer healthcare joint venture that operates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. In exchange for contributing our Consumer Healthcare business to the joint venture, we received a 32% equity stake in the new company and GSK owns the remaining 68%. Upon the closing of the transaction, we deconsolidated our Consumer Healthcare business and recognized a pre-tax gain of $8.1 billion ($5.4 billion, net of tax) in our fiscal third quarter of 2019 in (Gain) on completion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction for the difference in the fair value of our 32% equity stake in the new company and the carrying value of our Consumer Healthcare business. In accordance with our domestic and international reporting periods, our financial results, and our Consumer Healthcare segment’s operating results, for full-year 2019 reflect seven months of Consumer Healthcare segment domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare segment international operations. We record our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare joint venture on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions––net commencing from August 1, 2019. Therefore, we recorded our share of two months of the joint venture’s earnings generated in the third quarter of 2019 in our operating results in the fourth quarter of 2019. See footnote (5) below.

The financial results of Array BioPharma Inc. (Array) are included in our consolidated financial statements commencing from the acquisition date of July 30, 2019.

acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and reflects updated commercial forecasts mainly reflecting competitive pressures. In full-year 2019, also includes intangible asset impairment charges of $181 million, $90 million of which represents in-process research and development (IPR&D) related to a pre-clinical stage asset from our acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics, Inc. for gene therapies for the potential treatment of patients with certain rare diseases. In the fourth quarter and full-year 2018, primarily included intangible asset impairment charges of $3.1 billion, mainly composed of (i) $2.6 billion related to developed technology rights, $242 million related to licensing agreements and $80 million related to IPR&D, all of which related to our acquisition of Hospira, for generic sterile injectable products associated with various indications and (ii) $117 million related to a multi-antigen vaccine IPR&D program for adults undergoing elective spinal fusion surgery. In 2018, the intangible asset impairment charges associated with the generic sterile injectable products reflect, among other things, updated commercial forecasts, reflecting an increased competitive environment as well as higher manufacturing costs, largely stemming from manufacturing and supply issues. The intangible asset impairment charge for the multi-antigen vaccine IPR&D program was the result of the Phase 2b trial reaching futility at a pre-planned interim analysis.

(h)In the fourth quarter of 2018 and full-year 2018 and 2019, mainly represents incremental costs associated with the design, planning and implementation of our new organizational structure, effective in the beginning of 2019, and primarily includes consulting, legal, tax and advisory services.

Full-year 2019 was also unfavorably impacted by the tax expense associated with the gain related to the completion of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture transaction with GSK and favorably impacted by a benefit of $1.4 billion, representing tax and interest, resulting from the favorable settlement of a U.S. IRS audit for multiple tax years, as well as the tax benefit recorded as a result of additional guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury related to the legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income/(loss) for fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 was favorably impacted primarily by (i) adjustments to the provisional estimate recorded as we finalized our accounting related to the tax effects of the TCJA, in accordance with guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, (ii) the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business, as well as (iii) the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)In 2018, Pfizer’s Non-GAAP Adjusted results included net gains on investments in equity securities, which favorably impacted full-year 2018 Adjusted Other (Income)/Deductions by $586 million and Adjusted Diluted EPS by $0.08. 

Beginning in 2019, Pfizer excludes net gains and losses on investments in equity securities from Non-GAAP Adjusted results because of their inherent volatility, which is outside of Pfizer management’s control and cannot be predicted with any level of certainty. Additionally, Pfizer management does not believe that including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding Pfizer's business or is reflective of its core operations. Non-GAAP Adjusted financial results for fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 have been revised from previously reported amounts to conform with the 2019 presentation. See Note (4) below for additional information.

On July 31, 2019, we completed the transaction in which we and GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new consumer healthcare joint venture that operates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. In exchange for contributing our Consumer Healthcare business to the joint venture, we received a 32% equity stake in the new company and GSK owns the remaining 68%.

In accordance with our domestic and international reporting periods, our financial results, and our Consumer Healthcare segment’s operating results, for full-year 2019 reflect seven months of Consumer Healthcare segment domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare segment international operations. We record our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare joint venture on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions––net commencing from August 1, 2019. Therefore, we recorded our share of two months of the joint venture’s earnings generated in the third quarter of 2019 in our operating results in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted Earnings, see footnote (5) below, our share of certain charges recognized by the joint venture primarily related to restructuring activities and business combination accounting are excluded from the measure. The gain generated from the contribution of our Consumer Healthcare business was also excluded from Adjusted Income.

The financial results of Array BioPharma Inc. (Array) are included in our consolidated financial statements commencing from the acquisition date of July 30, 2019.

The financial results of Therachon Holding AG (Therachon) are included in our consolidated financial statements commencing from the acquisition date of July 1, 2019.

(5)Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS.

Because of their non-standardized definitions, Non-GAAP Adjusted income and its components and Non-GAAP Adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies.

(1)At the beginning of our 2019 fiscal year, we began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of three distinct business segments: Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group (Biopharma), Upjohn and through July 31, 2019, Consumer Healthcare. See footnote (2) below for additional information.

Additionally, certain costs and expenses are now managed in different parts of the organization than they were prior to the reorganization. We have revised prior-period information (Revenues and Earnings, as defined by management) to conform to the current management structure.

On July 31, 2019, we completed the transaction in which we and GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new consumer healthcare joint venture that operates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. In exchange for contributing our Consumer Healthcare business to the joint venture, we received a 32% equity stake in the new company and GSK owns the remaining 68%. Upon the closing of the transaction, we deconsolidated our Consumer Healthcare business and recognized a pre-tax gain of $8.1 billion ($5.4 billion net of tax) in our fiscal third quarter of 2019 in (Gain) on completion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction for the difference in the fair value of our 32% equity stake in the new company and the carrying value of our Consumer Healthcare business. In accordance with our domestic and international reporting periods, our financial results, and our Consumer Healthcare segment’s operating results, for full-year 2019 reflect seven months of Consumer Healthcare segment domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare segment international operations. We record our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare joint venture on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions––net commencing from August 1, 2019. Therefore, we recorded our share of two months of the joint venture’s earnings generated in the third quarter of 2019 in our operating results in the fourth quarter of 2019. As of the July 31, 2019 closing date, the fair value of our investment in GSK Consumer Healthcare was approximately $15.7 billion.

The financial results of Array BioPharma Inc. (Array) are included in our consolidated financial statements commencing from the acquisition date of July 30, 2019.

The financial results of Therachon Holding AG (Therachon) are included in our consolidated financial statements commencing from the acquisition date of July 1, 2019. Therefore, in accordance with our international reporting period, our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019 reflect three months and for full-year 2019 reflect five months of Therachon operations. In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and development expenses in our fiscal third quarter of 2019.

R&D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. The WRDM organization also has responsibility

NOTES TO OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION - (UNAUDITED)

for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide end-to-end technical expertise and other services to the various R&D projects, as well as the Worldwide Medical and Safety group, which ensures that Pfizer provides all stakeholders––including patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, payers and health authorities––with complete and up-to-date information on the risks and benefits associated with Pfizer products so that they can make appropriate decisions on how and when to use Pfizer’s medicines.

(b)GPD––the costs associated with our GPD organization, which is generally responsible for clinical trials from WRDM in the Biopharma portfolio, including late stage portfolio spend. GPD also provides technical support and other services to Pfizer R&D projects. GPD is responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies. 

(c)Other––the operating results of our Consumer Healthcare business, through July 31, 2019, and costs associated with other commercial activities not managed as part of Biopharma or Upjohn, including all strategy, business development, portfolio management and valuation capabilities, which previously had been reported in various parts of the organization. See Note (1) above.

(d)Corporate and Other Unallocated––the costs associated with platform functions (such as worldwide technology, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement), patient advocacy activities and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments, as well as overhead expenses associated with our manufacturing (which include manufacturing variances associated with production) and commercial operations that are not directly assessed to an operating segment, as business unit (segment) management does not manage these costs. 

For information purposes only, the following tables present reconciliations of the Biopharma segment operating results and Upjohn segment operating results to Biopharma and Upjohn operating results including estimated Other costs generally associated with the Biopharma and Upjohn operating segments. While we do not manage our segments or have performance goals under such an allocated manner, we believe that some investors may find this information useful in their analyses.

The estimated Other costs generally associated with our operating segments do not purport to reflect the additional amounts that each of our operating segments would have incurred had each segment operated as a standalone company during the periods presented. 

For information purposes only, for full-year 2019, we estimate that Other costs attributable to our Biopharma and Upjohn segments, as described above, for combined WRDM, GPD and other business activities costs are $6.4 billion, and combined Corporate and Other Unallocated costs are $4.8 billion, which excludes income and costs associated with our Consumer Healthcare business. The combined Corporate and Other Unallocated costs also exclude (i) net interest-related expense not attributable to an operating segment included in Corporate (approximately $1.4 billion for full-year 2019 in Other (income)/deductions––net); and (ii) net income from investments and other assets not attributable to an operating segment included in Corporate (approximately $318 million for full-year 2019 in Other (income)/deductions––net). The remaining costs have been attributed to our Biopharma and Upjohn operating segments, as follows:

(a) Amount represents the revenues and costs managed by the operating segments. The expenses generally include only those costs directly attributable to the operating segment. See note (2) above for more information.

(b) Represents costs not assessed to an operating segment, as business unit (segment) management does not manage these costs. For a description of these other costs and business activities, see note (3) above.

•WRDM/GPD/Other Business Activities––The information provided for WRDM, GPD and Other Business Activities was substantially all derived from our estimates of the costs incurred in connection with the R&D projects associated with the Biopharma and Upjohn operating segments as well as specific identification and estimates of costs incurred in connection with activities associated with the Biopharma and Upjohn operating segments.

•Corporate/Other Unallocated––The information provided for Corporate and Other Unallocated was derived mainly using proportional allocation methods based on global, regional or country revenues or global, regional or country headcount, as well as certain cost metrics, as appropriate, such as those derived from research and development and manufacturing costs, and, to a lesser extent, specific identification and estimates. Management believes that the allocations of Corporate and Other Unallocated costs are reasonable.

The estimated Other costs generally associated with our Biopharma and Upjohn operating segments do not purport to reflect the additional amounts that each of the operating segments would have incurred had each segment operated as a standalone company during the periods presented.

(c) See note (4) below for an explanation of our Non-GAAP Adjusted financial measure.

NOTES TO REVENUES TABLE INFORMATION

(UNAUDITED)

The above tables and related footnotes reflect our current commercial operating structure beginning in first-quarter 2019.

(a)Total International represents Developed Europe region + Developed Rest of World region + Emerging Markets region. Details for these regions are described in footnotes (m) to (o) below, respectively, and the product revenues from these regions are described on pages 41 and 43.

(b)The Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group encompasses Internal Medicine, Oncology, Hospital, Vaccines, Inflammation & Immunology and Rare Disease. The Hospital business unit commercializes our global portfolio of sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines, and also includes Pfizer CentreOne(h).

(c)We reclassified certain products from the Legacy Established Products (LEP) category, including Premarin family products, and certain other products from the legacy Peri-LOE category, including Pristiq, to the Internal Medicine category and reclassified Lyrica from the Internal Medicine category to the Upjohn business to conform 2018 product revenues to the current presentation.

(d)We performed certain reclassifications in the All other Oncology category to conform 2018 product revenues to the current presentation.

(e)Biosimilars are highly similar versions of approved and authorized biological medicines and primarily include revenues from Inflectra/Remsima and Retacrit.

(f)Hospital is a business unit that commercializes our global portfolio of sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines. We performed certain reclassifications, primarily from the legacy Sterile Injectables Pharmaceuticals (SIP) category (Sulperazon, Medrol, Fragmin, Tygacil, Zosyn/Tazocin and Precedex, among other products), the LEP category (Epipen and Zithromax), and the legacy Peri-LOE category (Vfend and Zyvox) to the Hospital category to conform 2018 product revenues to the current presentation. Hospital also includes Pfizer CentreOne(h). All other Hospital primarily includes revenues from legacy SIP products (that are not anti-infective products) and, to a much lesser extent, solid oral dose products (that are not anti-infective products). SIP anti-infective products that are not individually listed above are recorded in “All other Anti-infectives”.

(g)2018 revenues for Medrol and Zithromax may not agree to previously disclosed revenues because revenues for those products were previously split between LEP and the legacy SIP categories. All revenues for these products are currently reported in the Hospital category.

(h)Pfizer CentreOne includes revenues from our contract manufacturing and active pharmaceutical ingredient sales operation, including sterile injectables contract manufacturing, and revenues related to our manufacturing and supply agreements, including with Zoetis Inc. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we sold our equity share in Hisun Pfizer. As a result, effective in the first quarter of 2018, Hisun Pfizer-related revenues, previously reported in emerging markets within legacy All Other LEP and legacy All Other SIP, are reported in emerging markets within Pfizer CentreOne.

(i)We reclassified Inflectra/Remsima from the legacy Biosimilars category to the Inflammation & Immunology category to conform 2018 product revenues to the current presentation.

(j)Pfizer’s Upjohn business is a global, primarily off-patent branded and generic medicines business, which includes a portfolio of 20 globally recognized solid oral dose brands including Lyrica, Lipitor, Norvasc, Celebrex and Viagra, as well as a U.S.-based generics platform, Greenstone.

(k)On July 31, 2019, Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare business, an over-the-counter medicines business, was combined with GSK’s consumer healthcare business to form a new consumer healthcare joint venture, of which we own 32%. Upon the closing of the transaction, we deconsolidated our Consumer Healthcare business and from August 1, 2019 began to record our pro rata share of the joint venture’s earnings on a one-quarter lag basis in Other (income)/deductions––net and to receive dividends, which are paid on a quarterly basis. Therefore, we have recorded our share of two months of the joint venture’s earnings generated in the third quarter of 2019 in our operating results in the fourth quarter of 2019. In accordance with our domestic and international reporting periods, our financial results, and our Consumer Healthcare segment’s operating results, for full-year 2019 reflect seven months of Consumer Healthcare segment domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare segment international operations.

(l)Sterile Injectable Pharmaceuticals represents the total of all branded and generic injectable products in the Hospital business, including anti-infective sterile injectable pharmaceuticals.

(m)Developed Europe region includes the following markets: Western Europe, Scandinavian countries and Finland.

(n)Developed Rest of World region includes the following markets: Japan, Canada, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.

(o)Emerging Markets region includes, but is not limited to, the following markets: Asia (excluding Japan and South Korea), Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Central Europe and Turkey.

▪the risk we may not be able to successfully address all of the comments received from regulatory authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or obtain approval from regulators, which will depend on myriad factors, including such regulator making a determination as to whether a product’s benefits outweigh its known risks and a determination of the product’s efficacy; regulatory decisions impacting labeling, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters; and recommendations by technical or advisory committees, such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, that may impact the use of our vaccines; 

▪the speed with which regulatory authorizations, pricing approvals and product launches may be achieved;

▪claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety or efficacy of in-line products and product candidates, including claims and concerns that may arise from the outcome of post-approval clinical trials, which could result in the loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of, a product that could affect its availability or commercial potential, such as the update to the U.S. and EU prescribing information for Xeljanz;

▪the success of external business-development activities, including the ability to identify and execute on potential business development opportunities, the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions in the anticipated time frame or at all, the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any such transactions, and the potential need to obtain additional equity or debt financing to pursue these opportunities which could result in increased leverage and impact our credit ratings;

▪competitive developments, including the impact on our competitive position of new product entrants, in-line branded products, generic products, private label products, biosimilars and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line drugs and drug candidates;

▪the implementation by the FDA and regulatory authorities in certain countries of an abbreviated legal pathway to approve biosimilar products, which could subject our biologic products to competition from biosimilar products, with attendant competitive pressures, after the expiration of any applicable exclusivity period and patent rights;

▪risks related to our ability to develop and commercialize biosimilars, including risks associated with “at risk” launches, defined as the marketing of a product by Pfizer before the final resolution of litigation (including any appeals) brought by a third party alleging that such marketing would infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by the third party, and access challenges for our biosimilar products where our product may not receive appropriate formulary access or remains in a disadvantaged position relative to the innovator product;

▪the ability to meet competition from generic, branded and biosimilar products after the loss or expiration of patent protection for our products or competitor products;

▪the ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally;

- 45 -

▪difficulties or delays in manufacturing, including delays caused by natural events, such as hurricanes; supply disruptions, shortages or stock-outs at our facilities; and legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctions, debarment, recall of a product, delays or denials of product approvals, import bans or denial of import certifications;

▪the impact of any U.S. healthcare reform or legislation, including any replacement, repeal, modification or invalidation of some or all of the provisions of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act;

▪U.S. federal or state legislation or regulatory action and/or policy efforts affecting, among other things, pharmaceutical product pricing, intellectual property, reimbursement or access, including under Medicaid, Medicare and other publicly funded or subsidized health programs; patient out-of-pocket costs for medicines, manufacturer prices and/or price increases that could result in new mandatory rebates and discounts or other pricing restrictions; general budget control actions; the importation of prescription drugs from outside the U.S. at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign countries; revisions to reimbursement of biopharmaceuticals under government programs; restrictions on U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising; limitations on interactions with healthcare professionals; or the use of comparative effectiveness methodologies that could be implemented in a manner that focuses primarily on the cost differences and minimizes the therapeutic differences among pharmaceutical products and restricts access to innovative medicines; as well as pricing pressures for our products as a result of highly competitive insurance markets;

▪legislation or regulatory action in markets outside the U.S., including China, affecting pharmaceutical product pricing, intellectual property, reimbursement or access, including, in particular, continued government-mandated reductions in prices and access restrictions for certain biopharmaceutical products to control costs in those markets;
