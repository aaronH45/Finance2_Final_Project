Business Segment Results

Utility

For fourth quarter 2019, the Utility business reported earnings attributable to Entergy Corporation of $271 million, or $1.35 per share, on an as-reported basis, and earnings of $229 million, or $1.14 per share, on an adjusted basis. This compared to fourth quarter 2018 earnings of $388 million, or $2.12 per share, on an as-reported basis, and earnings of $209 million, or $1.14 per share, on an adjusted basis. Drivers for the quarter included:

•rate activity at E-AR, E-LA, E-MS, and E-TX;

•regulatory charges and provisions in fourth quarter 2018; and

•a fourth quarter 2019 favorable income tax item (considered an adjustment and excluded from adjusted earnings).

These drivers were partially offset by:

•lower retail sales volume;

•higher operating expenses (primarily depreciation and other O&M); 

•higher interest expense; 

•a fourth quarter 2018 favorable income tax item, net of customer sharing (considered an adjustment and excluded from adjusted earnings); and

•a fourth quarter 2018 reversal of a tax reform accrual (considered an adjustment and excluded from adjusted earnings).

For full year 2019, the Utility business reported earnings attributable to Entergy Corporation of $1,411 million, or $7.16 per share, on an as-reported basis, and earnings of $1,369 million, or $6.95 per share, on an adjusted basis. This compared to full year 2018 earnings of $1,483 million, or $8.09 per share, on an as-reported basis, and $1,262 million, or $6.88 per share, on an adjusted basis. Drivers for the full year included: 

•rate activity at E-AR, E-LA, E-MS, and E-TX;

•regulatory charges and provisions in 2018; and

•a fourth quarter 2019 favorable income tax item (considered an adjustment and excluded from adjusted earnings).

These drivers were partially offset by:

•lower retail sales volume, including less favorable weather;

•higher operating expenses (primarily depreciation and other O&M); 

•higher interest expense;

•second and fourth quarter 2018 favorable income tax items, net of customer sharing, (considered adjustments and excluded from adjusted earnings); and

•a fourth quarter 2018 reversal of a tax reform accrual (considered an adjustment and excluded from adjusted earnings).

On a per share basis, both fourth quarter and full year 2019 results reflected higher common shares outstanding.

Appendix C contains additional details on Utility financial and operating measures.

Parent & Other

For fourth quarter 2019, Parent & Other reported a loss attributable to Entergy Corporation of $(103 million), or (51) cents per share, on an as-reported basis, and a loss of $(92 million), or (46) 

cents per share, on an adjusted basis. This compared to a loss of $(81 million), or (44) cents per share, on both an as-reported and an adjusted basis in fourth quarter 2018. Drivers for the quarter included:

•lower other income (deductions)-other due to the timing of a charitable contribution; and

•a fourth quarter 2019 income tax item related to a valuation allowance recorded on an interest expense deduction (the amount related to the 2018 tax year was considered an adjustment and excluded from adjusted earnings).

For the full year, Parent & Other reported a loss attributable to Entergy Corporation of $(316 million), or $(1.60) per share, on an as-reported basis, and a loss of $(305 million), or $(1.55) per share, on an adjusted basis. This compared to a full year 2018 loss of $(292 million), or $(1.59) per share, on both an as-reported and an adjusted basis. The drivers for fourth quarter 2019 discussed above were also the drivers for the full year.

On a per share basis, both fourth quarter and full year 2019 results reflected higher common shares outstanding.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities 

For fourth quarter 2019, EWC reported earnings attributable to Entergy Corporation of 

$217 million, or $1.08 per share, on an as-reported basis. This compared to a fourth quarter 2018 loss attributable to Entergy Corporation of $(373 million), or $(2.04) per share, on an as-reported basis. Drivers for the quarter included:

•higher gains on decommissioning trust funds; 

•favorable income tax items recorded in fourth quarter 2019;

•lower asset write-offs, impairments and related charges as compared to a year ago; and

•lower severance and retention expense, as well as lower O&M expense due to the shutdown of Pilgrim.

These drivers were partially offset by lower revenue primarily due to the shutdown of Pilgrim. 

For the full year, EWC reported earnings attributable to Entergy Corporation of 

$147 million, or 74 cents per share, on an as-reported basis. This compared to a full year 2018 loss attributable to Entergy Corporation of $(343 million), or $(1.87) per share, on an as-reported basis. Drivers for the year included:

•higher gains on decommissioning trust funds; 

•lower asset write-offs, impairments and related charges as compared to a year ago;

•lower severance and retention expense, as well as lower O&M expense due to the shutdown of Pilgrim; and 

•favorable income tax items in 2019 as compared to 2018.

These drivers were partially offset by lower revenue primarily due to the shutdown of Pilgrim and higher nuclear refueling outage expense.

On a per share basis, both fourth quarter and full year 2019 results reflected higher common shares outstanding.

Appendix D contains additional details on EWC financial and operating measures, including reconciliation for non-GAAP EWC adjusted EBITDA.

Earnings per Share Guidance

Entergy initiated its 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.45 to $5.75. See webcast presentation slides for additional details.

The company has provided 2020 earnings guidance with regard to the non-GAAP measure of Entergy adjusted EPS. This measure excludes from the corresponding GAAP financial measure the effect of adjustments as described below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” The company has not provided a reconciliation of such non-GAAP guidance to guidance presented on a GAAP basis because it cannot predict and quantify with a reasonable degree of confidence all of the adjustments that may occur during the periods. One such adjustment will be the exclusion of EWC earnings from Entergy adjusted EPS. We currently estimate that the contribution of EWC to Entergy’s as-reported EPS will be approximately (40) cents in 2020. These estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty due to, among other things, the potential effects of exiting the EWC business.

A replay of the teleconference will be available on Entergy’s website at www.entergy.com and by telephone. The telephone replay will be available through February 26, 2020, by dialing 855-859-2056, conference ID 1253867. 

Entergy Corporation is an integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail distribution operations. Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity, including 9,000 megawatts of nuclear power. Entergy delivers electricity to 2.9 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Entergy has annual revenues of $11 billion and approximately 13,600 employees. 

Entergy Corporation’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE Chicago under the symbol “ETR.”

Details regarding Entergy’s results of operations, regulatory proceedings, and other matters are available in this earnings release, a copy of which will be filed with the SEC, and the webcast slide presentation. Both documents are available on Entergy’s Investor Relations website at www.entergy.com/investor_relations. 

Entergy maintains a web page as part of its Investor Relations website, entitled Regulatory and Other Information, which provides investors with key updates of certain regulatory proceedings and important milestones on the execution of its strategy. While some of this information may be considered material information, investors should not rely exclusively on this page for all relevant company information.

For definitions of certain operating measures, as well as GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and abbreviations and acronyms used in the earnings release materials, see Appendix F. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

This news release contains non-GAAP financial measures, which are generally numerical measures of a company’s performance, financial position, or cash flows that either exclude or include amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Entergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within this news release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 

Entergy reports earnings using the non-GAAP measure of Entergy adjusted earnings, which excludes the effect of certain “adjustments,” including the removal of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment in light of the company’s decision to exit the merchant power business. Adjustments are unusual or non-recurring items or events or other items or events that management believes do not reflect the ongoing business of Entergy, such as the results of the EWC segment, significant tax items, and other items such as certain costs, expenses, or other specified items. In addition to reporting GAAP consolidated earnings on a per share basis, Entergy reports its adjusted earnings on a per share basis. These per share measures represent the applicable earnings amount divided by the diluted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. 

Management uses the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share for, among other things, financial planning and analysis; reporting financial results to the board of directors, employees, stockholders, analysts, and investors; and internal evaluation of financial performance. Entergy believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of Entergy’s business, comparing period to period results, and comparing Entergy’s financial performance to the financial performance of other companies in the utility sector. 

Other non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA; adjusted ROE; adjusted ROIC; gross liquidity; debt to capital, excluding securitization debt; net debt to net capital, excluding securitization debt; parent debt to total debt, excluding securitization debt; FFO; FFO to debt, excluding securitization debt; and FFO to debt, excluding securitization debt, return of unprotected excess ADIT, and severance and retention payments associated with exit of EWC, are measures Entergy uses internally for management and board discussions and to gauge the overall strength of its business. Entergy believes the above data provides useful information to investors in evaluating Entergy’s ongoing financial results and flexibility and assists investors in comparing Entergy’s credit and liquidity to the credit and liquidity of others in the Utility sector. In addition, other financial measures including net income (or earnings), adjusted for preferred dividends and tax-effected interest expense; return on average invested capital; and return on average common equity are included on both an adjusted and an as-reported basis. In each case, the metrics defined as “adjusted” (other than EWC’s adjusted EBITDA) excludes the effect of adjustments as defined above. EWC’s adjusted EBITDA represents EWC’s earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization, and also excludes decommissioning expense.

These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of Entergy’s operations that, when viewed with Entergy’s GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors 

and trends affecting Entergy’s business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be used to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Investors are strongly encouraged to review Entergy’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Although certain of these measures are intended to assist investors in comparing Entergy’s performance to other companies in the utility sector, non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized; therefore, it might not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.

Financial Statements

Financial statements are presented in this section.

A: Consolidated Results and Adjustments

Appendix A-1 provides a comparative summary of consolidated earnings, including a reconciliation of as-reported earnings (GAAP) to adjusted earnings (non-GAAP). 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Calculations may differ due to rounding

(a)Per share amounts are calculated by dividing the corresponding earnings (loss) by the diluted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.

See Appendix B for detailed earnings variance analysis.

Appendix A-2 provides a comparative summary of OCF, by business. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Calculations may differ due to rounding

OCF increased quarter-over-quarter due primarily to a lower amount of unprotected excess ADIT returned to customers at the Utility, as well as lower nuclear refueling outage spending and severance and retention payments at EWC. Higher pension contributions, largely at the Utility, partially offset the quarterly increase. 

OCF increased year-over-year due primarily to a lower amount of unprotected excess ADIT returned to customers and increased collections for fuel and purchased power cost recovery at the Utility, as well as lower nuclear spending and asset retirement obligation spending at EWC. Lower revenues and higher severance and retention payments at EWC partially offset the annual increase.

For both the quarter and the full year, intercompany income tax payments contributed to the line of business variances.

Appendix A-3 and Appendix A-4 list adjustments by business. Amounts are shown on both an earnings and an EPS basis. Adjustments are included in as-reported earnings consistent with GAAP but are excluded from adjusted earnings. As a result, adjusted earnings is considered a non-GAAP measure. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Calculations may differ due to rounding

(b)Per share amounts are calculated by dividing the corresponding earnings (loss) by the diluted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

B: Earnings Variance Analysis 

Appendix B-1 and Appendix B-2 provide details of current quarter and year-to-date 2019 versus 2018 as-reported and adjusted earnings variance analysis for Utility, Parent & Other, and EWC.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Calculations may differ due to rounding [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(d)EPS effect is calculated by multiplying the pre-tax amount by the estimated income tax rate that is expected to apply and dividing by diluted average number of common shares outstanding for the prior period; income taxes-other represents income tax differences other than the tax effect of individual line items.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(e)The fourth quarter and year-to-date earnings increases were primarily driven by rate activity from E-AR’s FRP; E-LA’s FRP, including recovery of the St. Charles Power Station; E-LA’s AMI rider; E-MS’s FRP; the recovery of the Choctaw Generating Station; and E-TX’s base rate case. The variance also reflected three regulatory charges in fourth quarter 2018: first, a regulatory charge at E-TX to return the benefit of the lower federal tax rate to customers, second, regulatory provisions that lowered earnings into the allowed ranges at E-AR and E-MS as required by their FRPs, and 

third, a regulatory liability for tax sharing with E-AR customers (this partially offsets the income tax item discussed in footnote q). These increases were partially offset by the net effect of volume/weather. Fourth quarter 2019 results also reflected an accrual for the E-NO rate case decision, which is being appealed. The year-to-date increase also reflected 2018 regulatory charges at E-LA to return the benefit of the lower tax rate to customers.

(f)The fourth quarter and year-to-date earnings decreases were due largely to lower revenues from the shutdown of Pilgrim in May 2019, lower capacity prices, and impacts on fuel expense from EWC plant impairments. These were partially offset by higher energy volume from EWC’s other nuclear plants. 

(g)The fourth quarter and year-to-date earnings decreases from higher EWC nuclear refueling outage expense were due primarily to increased outage amortization at Palisades due to the plant no longer being impaired.

(h)The fourth quarter and year-to-date earnings decreases from higher Utility other O&M reflected higher spending on information technology, initiatives to explore new customer products and services, and compensation and benefits. Also contributing was the gain on a sale of an asset in fourth quarter 2018. This was partially offset by lower nuclear generation spending and from litigation awards from the DOE in connection with spent nuclear fuel storage costs. 

(i)The fourth quarter and year-to-date earnings increases from lower EWC other O&M were due largely to a decrease in severance and retention expense, as well as the Pilgrim plant shutdown in May 2019.

(j)The fourth quarter and year-to-date earnings increases from lower EWC asset write-offs and impairments were due primarily to a revision of Vermont Yankee's ARO, partially offset by a gain on proceeds from the settlement of spent fuel litigation at Pilgrim, both in fourth quarter 2018. 

(k)The fourth quarter earnings increase from lower EWC decommissioning expense was due to the Pilgrim plant sale in 2019.

(l)The fourth quarter and year-to-date earnings decreases from higher Utility depreciation expense were due primarily to higher plant in service, including the St. Charles Power Station, as well as higher new depreciation rates at E-MS and E-TX, partially offset by updated depreciation rates at SERI (offset in operating revenue). The year-to-date decrease also reflected a depreciation adjustment at SERI in the third quarter 2018 (offset in operating revenue).

(m)The fourth quarter earnings increase from higher Utility other income (deductions)-other was due largely to differences in decommissioning trust fund returns. Based on regulatory treatment, decommissioning-related variances are largely earnings neutral. The year-to-date earnings increase was due largely to an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2019, which included the Lake Charles Power Station, Montgomery County Power Station, and New Orleans Power Station projects.

(n)The fourth quarter and year-to-date earnings decreases from lower Parent & Other other income (deductions)-other were due to the timing of a charitable contribution.

(o)The fourth quarter and year-to-date earnings increases from higher EWC other income (deductions)-other were due largely to higher gains on the decommissioning trust fund investments in 2019 as compared to 2018. The year-to-date increase was partially offset by a pension settlement charge in third quarter 2019 related to the exit of the EWC business.

(p)The fourth quarter and year-to-date earnings decreases from higher Utility interest expense were due primarily to higher debt balances at E-LA and E-AR.

(q)The fourth quarter and year-to-date as-reported earnings decreases from higher Utility income taxes reflected two fourth quarter 2018 tax items and one fourth quarter 2019 tax item, all classified as adjustments. In fourth quarter 2018, approximately $170 million resulting from the restructuring of E-AR (partly offset by customer sharing recorded as a regulatory charge) and $38 million related to the reversal of a tax accrual at E-TX were recorded. In the fourth quarter 2019, a $41 million income tax item was generated through the reversal of a valuation allowance generated as part of the 2018 internal restructuring. The year-to-date earnings decrease also reflected a $43 million income tax benefit which resulted from the settlement of the 2012 / 2013 IRS audit in second quarter 2018.

(r)The fourth quarter and year-to-date as-reported earnings decreases from higher Parent & Other income taxes related to a valuation allowance recorded on the expected interest limitation carryover. Approximately $11 million related to tax year 2018 (classified as an adjustment) and approximately $11 million related to tax year 2019.

(s)The fourth quarter and year-to-date earnings increases from lower EWC income taxes reflected three items from fourth quarter 2019. First, a restructuring within the EWC business resulted in a reduction in income tax expense of $156 million. Second, a donation to the State University of New York triggered the recognition of an associated tax deduction, resulting in a decrease to tax expense of $19 million. Third, an EWC subsidiary recognized a reduction in tax expense of $18 million. The year-to-date earnings increase was largely offset by three items from 2018 and one from 2019. First, there was $13 million in tax benefits from the settlement of the 2012 / 2013 IRS audit in second quarter 2018. Second, a restructuring of an interest in an EWC decommissioning trust fund resulted in a reduction in income tax expense of $107 million in third quarter 2018. Third, the conclusion of a state income tax audit resulted in a benefit of $23 million in third quarter 2018. Lastly, an accrual of $29 million of tax expense, which resulted from the sale of Vermont Yankee in January 2019 contributed to the year-to-date variance.

(t)The fourth quarter and year-to-date earnings per share impacts from share effect were due to settlement of the equity forward (6.8 million shares settled in December 2018 and 8.4 million shares settled in May 2019).

(u)The year-to-date earnings decrease from higher Utility decommissioning expense related to revisions to estimated decommissioning costs liabilities resulting from updated decommissioning cost studies at certain Utility nuclear plants. Based on regulatory treatment, decommissioning-related variances are largely earnings neutral.

(v)The year-to date earnings decrease from higher Utility taxes other than income taxes was primarily due to higher ad valorem taxes at E-AR and E-LA.

(w)The year-to-date earnings increase from lower EWC taxes other than income taxes was primarily due to lower ad valorem taxes due to a lower assessment at Palisades.

C: Utility Financial and Operating Measures 

Appendix C-1 provides comparative summaries of Utility operating and financial measures.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Calculations may differ due to rounding

(x)The effects of weather were estimated using heating degree days and cooling degree days for the billing cycles from certain locations within each jurisdiction and comparing to “normal” weather based on 20-year historical data. The models used to estimate weather are updated periodically and are subject to change.

On a weather-adjusted basis for fourth quarter 2019, retail billed sales decreased (0.6) percent. Residential billed sales decreased (1.2) percent primarily due to fewer days billed compared to a year ago. Commercial billed sales decreased (2.2) percent driven by the continued impact of energy efficiency. Industrial billed sales volume increased 0.8 percent driven by continued growth from new/expansion customers, partially offset by lower sales to cogeneration customers. 

On a weather-adjusted basis for full year 2019, retail billed sales decreased (0.8) percent. Residential and commercial billed sales decreased (1.2) and (1.9) percent respectively, driven by the continued impact of energy efficiency. Fewer days billed also contributed to the residential billed sales decrease. Industrial billed sales volume increased 0.2 percent driven by continued growth from new/expansion customers, partially offset by lower sales to cogeneration customers.
