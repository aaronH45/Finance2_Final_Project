Fourth Quarter 2019 Operating Results

Sales of $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 were even with the year-ago period. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by 2 percent and business exits in conjunction with the 2018 Global Restructuring Program reduced sales slightly. Organic sales increased 3 percent. Net selling prices rose more than 2 percent and product mix improved 1 percent, while volumes fell 1 percent. In North America, organic sales increased 3 percent in both consumer products and in K-C Professional. Outside North America, organic sales rose 3 percent in developing and emerging markets and 1 percent in developed markets.

Fourth quarter operating profit was $751 million in 2019 and $639 million in 2018. Results in both periods include charges related to the 2018 Global Restructuring Program. Results in 2019 also include a gain on the sale of property associated with a former manufacturing facility that was closed as part of a past restructuring.

Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit was $826 million in 2019 and $742 million in 2018. Results benefited from higher net selling prices, improved product mix, $85 million of cost savings from the company’s FORCE (Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere) program and $40 million of cost savings from the 2018 Global Restructuring Program. Input costs decreased $60 million, driven by pulp, while other manufacturing costs rose year-on-year. Selling, general and administrative costs were higher, including increased incentive compensation expense and investments to improve commercial capabilities. Advertising spending also increased year-on-year. Unfavorable foreign currency translation and transaction effects also impacted the comparison.

The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 17.2 percent in 2019 and 18.6 percent in 2018. The fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 24.6 percent in 2019 and 19.1 percent in 2018. The rate in 2018 benefited from planning initiatives and resolution of certain matters.

Kimberly-Clark’s share of net income of equity companies in the fourth quarter was $32 million in 2019 and $23 million in 2018. Results benefited from volume growth, lower input costs and cost savings. 

Cash Flow and Balance Sheet

Cash provided by operations in the fourth quarter was $924 million in 2019 and $949 million in 2018. Full-year cash provided by operations was $2,736 million in 2019 and $2,970 million in 2018. The full-year comparison was impacted by increased working capital and tax payments, partially offset by higher earnings and lower pension contributions. Capital spending for the fourth quarter was $342 million in 2019 and $311 million in 2018. Full-year spending was $1,209 million in 2019, including significant spending related to the 2018 Global Restructuring Program, compared to $877 million in 2018. 

Fourth quarter 2019 share repurchases were 1.9 million shares at a cost of $252 million, bringing full-year repurchases to 6.2 million shares at a cost of $800 million. Total debt was $7.7 billion at the end of 2019 and $7.5 billion at the end of 2018.

2018 Global Restructuring Program

In January 2018, Kimberly-Clark initiated the 2018 Global Restructuring Program in order to reduce the company’s structural cost base and enhance the company’s flexibility to invest in its brands, growth initiatives and capabilities critical to delivering future growth. The company expects the program will generate annual pre-tax cost savings of $500 to $550 million by the end of 2021. As part of the program, Kimberly-Clark expects to exit or divest some low-margin businesses that generate approximately 1 percent of company net sales. To implement the program, the company expects to incur restructuring

charges of $1,700 to $1,900 million pre-tax ($1,300 to $1,400 million after tax) by the end of 2020. Through the end of 2019, the company has incurred cumulative restructuring charges of $1,402 million pre-tax ($1,031 million after tax) and generated cumulative savings of $300 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This news release and the accompanying tables include the following financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measures:

•Adjusted earnings and earnings per share

•Adjusted gross and operating profit

•Adjusted effective tax rate

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the accompanying non-GAAP reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures:

-6-

•2018 Global Restructuring Program. Mentioned elsewhere in this release.

•Property sale gain. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company recognized a gain on the sale of property associated with a former manufacturing facility that was closed in 2012 as part of a past restructuring.

•U.S. tax reform. In the first, third and fourth quarters of 2018, the company recognized net charges associated with U.S. tax reform related matters.

The company provides these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental information to our GAAP financial measures. Management and the company's Board of Directors use adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted gross and operating profit to (a) evaluate the company's historical and prospective financial performance and its performance relative to its competitors, (b) allocate resources and (c) measure the operational performance of the company's business units and their managers. Management also believes that the use of an adjusted effective tax rate provides improved insight into the tax effects of our ongoing business operations.

Additionally, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the company's Board of Directors has used certain of the non-GAAP financial measures when setting and assessing achievement of incentive compensation goals. These goals are based, in part, on the company's adjusted earnings per share and improvement in the company's adjusted return on invested capital and adjusted operating profit return on sales determined by excluding certain of the adjustments that are used in calculating these non-GAAP financial measures.

This news release includes information regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, net selling prices and product mix on net sales. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and exited businesses also impact the year-over-year change in net sales.
