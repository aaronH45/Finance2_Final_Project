Item 8.01 Other Events  

Morgan Stanley (the “Firm”) today announced that the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee of the Firm’s Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) has determined in consultation with the Firm’s Board of Directors, the 2019 compensation for James P. Gorman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Firm. This decision is based on the Compensation Committee’s assessment of Mr. Gorman’s outstanding individual performance, including his leadership of the Firm’s long-term strategy and culture, as well as the Firm’s strong financial performance. 

The Compensation Committee set Mr. Gorman’s total compensation for 2019 at $27 million compared with $29 million for 2018. Mr. Gorman’s 2019 compensation is comprised of four parts: a base salary of $1.5 million; a cash bonus of $6.375 million; a deferred equity award of $6.375 million; and a performance-vested equity award of $12.750 million that converts to shares only if the Firm meets predetermined performance goals with respect to (a) average Firm return on equity and (b) relative total shareholder return over the three-year performance period. Consistent with 2018, for 2019, 75% of Mr. Gorman’s incentive compensation is deferred over three years and is subject to clawback and 100% of Mr. Gorman’s deferred incentive compensation is delivered in the form of equity awards, aligning his compensation with shareholders’ interests. 

Additional important information about the Registrant’s incentive compensation programs and governance, including an explanation of all material elements of the compensation for Mr. Gorman and the other named executive officers, will be presented in the Registrant’s proxy statement for the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in April 2020.
