Edison International Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2019 Results

ROSEMEAD, Calif., February 27, 2020 - Edison International (NYSE: EIX) today reported fourth quarter 2019 net income of $143 million, or $0.40 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.4 billion, or $4.39 loss per share, in the fourth quarter 2018. As adjusted, fourth quarter 2019 core earnings were $355 million, or $0.99 per share, compared to core earnings of $305 million, or $0.94 per share, in the fourth quarter 2018.

Southern California Edison's (SCE) fourth quarter 2019 net income of $194 million, or $0.54 per share, compared favorably to a net loss of $1.4 billion, or $4.38 loss per share, in the fourth quarter 2018. SCE's fourth quarter 2019 earnings per share (EPS) increased by $4.92 from the prior year period, consisting of $0.07 of higher core EPS and $4.85 of lower non-core loss per share. Higher core EPS was primarily due to the adoption of the 2018 General Rate Case (GRC) final decision and higher Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) revenue due to the settlement of SCE's 2018 Formula Rate proceeding and rate base growth, partially offset by higher wildfire mitigation expenses that were not deferred as regulatory assets and the increase in shares outstanding in 2019. Lower non-core loss per share was mainly related to the absence of an after-tax charge of $1.8 billion, or $5.60 per share, recorded in the fourth quarter 2018 related to wildfire-related claims associated with the 2017/2018 wildfire events, net of recoveries, and the increase in shares outstanding in 2019. This was partially offset by an after-tax charge of $157 million, or $0.44 per share, recorded in the fourth quarter 2019 related to wildfire-related claims associated with the 2017/2018 wildfire events, net of recoveries, and an after-tax expense of $61 million, or $0.17 per share, related to the amortization of SCE's contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund.

Edison International Parent and Other's fourth quarter 2019 net loss of $51 million, or $0.14 loss per share, was higher than a net loss of $35 million, or $0.11 loss per share, reported in the fourth quarter 2018. Edison International Parent and Other’s fourth quarter 2019 loss per share increased by $0.03 compared to fourth quarter 2018, consisting of $0.02 of higher core loss per share and $0.01 of higher non-core loss per share. Higher core loss per share was primarily due to higher interest expense and corporate expenses, partially offset by the increase in shares outstanding in 2019 and the absence of an after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $13 million, or $0.04 per share, on the Edison Energy reporting unit in 2018. The higher non-core loss per share was mainly related to an after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $18 million, or $0.05 per share, on the Edison Energy reporting unit in 2019. 

Additionally, Edison International recorded net income of $34 million, or $0.10 per share, from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter 2018.

“An important part of 2019 was the State’s enactment and initial implementation of Assembly Bill 1054, including SCE’s participation in the Wildfire Fund and receipt of its approved safety certification,” said Pedro J. Pizarro, president and chief executive officer of Edison International. “SCE filed its 2021 General Rate Case which continues our significant investment in wildfire mitigation through grid hardening, increased situational awareness and enhanced operational practices, while investing in transportation electrification and infrastructure replacement. Additionally, through its Pathway 2045 whitepaper, SCE has identified substantial long-term opportunities across California to help meet the state’s 2045 carbon neutrality goal.”

Full-Year Earnings

For 2019, Edison International reported net income of $1.3 billion, or $3.78 per share, compared to a net loss of $423 million, or $1.30 loss per share, for 2018. As adjusted, Edison International’s core earnings were $1.6 billion, or $4.70 per share, compared to core earnings of $1.4 billion, or $4.15 per share, in 2018.

SCE's 2019 net income of $1.4 billion, or $4.15 per share, compared favorably to a net loss of $310 million, or $0.95 loss per share, in 2018. SCE's 2019 EPS increased by $5.10 from 2018, consisting of $0.59 of higher core EPS and $4.51 of lower non-core loss per share. Higher core EPS were due to the adoption of the 2018 GRC final decision, higher FERC revenue due to the settlement of SCE's 2018 Formula Rate proceeding and rate base growth, and the timing of regulatory deferral and cost recovery of incremental wildfire insurance expenses. These increases were partially offset by higher wildfire mitigation expenses that were not deferred as regulatory assets and the increase in shares outstanding in 2019. Lower non-core loss per share was mainly related to the absence of an after-tax charge of $1.8 billion, or $5.60 per share, recorded in 2018 related to wildfire-related claims associated with the 2017/2018 wildfire events, net of recoveries, and the increase in shares outstanding in 2019, partially offset by an after-tax charge of $157 million, or $0.46 per share, recorded in 2019 related to wildfire-related claims associated with the 2017/2018 wildfire events, net of recoveries, an after-tax impairment charge of $123 million, or $0.36 per share, related to disallowed historical capital expenditures in the 2018 GRC final decision and an after-tax expense of $109 million, or $0.32 per share, related to the amortization of SCE's contributions to the Wildfire Insurance Fund.

Edison International Parent and Other's 2019 net loss of $125 million, or $0.37 loss per share, compared favorably to a net loss of $147 million, or $0.45 loss per share, reported in 2018. Edison International Parent and Other’s 2019 loss per share decreased by $0.08 compared to 2018, consisting of $0.04 of higher core loss per share and $0.12 of lower non-core loss per share. Higher core loss per share was primarily due to higher interest expense and corporate expenses, partially offset by lower losses from the competitive businesses under Edison Energy Group, the absence of an after-tax goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2018 of $13 million, or $0.04 per share, on the Edison Energy reporting unit and the increase in shares outstanding in 2019. Lower non-core loss per share was primarily due to the absence of a loss recorded in 2018 related to the sale of SoCore Energy, partially offset by an after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $18 million, or $0.06 per share, for Edison Energy reporting unit in 2019. 

Additionally, Edison International recorded net income of $34 million, or $0.10 per share, from discontinued operations in 2018.

Edison International uses core earnings, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts for significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. Edison International management believes that core earnings provide more meaningful comparisons of performance from period to period. Please see the attached tables for a reconciliation of core earnings to basic GAAP earnings.

Appendix

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Edison International’s earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States and represent the company’s earnings as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management uses core earnings and core earnings per share (EPS) internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance of Edison International and Southern California Edison. We also use core earnings and core EPS when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company’s performance from period to period. Financial measures referred to as net income, basic EPS, core earnings, or core EPS also apply to the description of earnings or earnings per share.

Core earnings and core EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Core earnings and core EPS are defined as basic earnings and basic EPS excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. Basic earnings and losses refer to net income or losses attributable to Edison International shareholders. Core earnings are reconciled to basic earnings in the attached tables. The impact of participating securities (vested awards that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for the principal operating subsidiary is not material to the principal operating subsidiary’s EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which is included in Edison International Parent and Other.

•extreme weather-related incidents and other natural disasters (including earthquakes and events caused, or exacerbated, by climate change, such as wildfires), which could cause, among other things, public safety issues, property damage and operational issues;

•physical security of Edison International's and SCE's critical assets and personnel and the cybersecurity of Edison International's and SCE's critical information technology systems for grid control, and business, employee and customer data;

•risks associated with cost allocation resulting in higher rates for utility bundled service customers because of possible customer bypass or departure for other electricity providers such as CCAs and Electric Service Providers;

•risks inherent in SCE's transmission and distribution infrastructure investment program, including those related to project site identification, public opposition, environmental mitigation, construction, permitting, power curtailment costs (payments due under power contracts in the event there is insufficient transmission to enable acceptance of power delivery), changes in the CAISO's transmission plans, and governmental approvals; and

•risks associated with the operation of transmission and distribution assets and power generating facilities, including public and employee safety issues, the risk of utility assets causing or contributing to wildfires, failure, availability, efficiency, and output of equipment and facilities, and availability and cost of spare parts.
