Financial Results

GAAP net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were $1.287 billion, down 6.4% from net sales of $1.375 billion in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. 

GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was $311.1 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, up from GAAP net income of $49.2 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, GAAP net income was significantly adversely impacted by purchase accounting adjustments associated with our acquisitions. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, GAAP net income was significantly positively impacted by the tax benefit related to the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights.

Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was $340.8 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, down from non-GAAP net income of $381.8 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, in the prior year's third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), IT security remediation costs, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, losses on the settlement of debt, and gains and losses related to available-for-sale investments. For the third quarters of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.

Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we reported non-GAAP net sales based on end-market demand, which excluded the effect of our distributors increasing or decreasing their inventory holdings. Beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we changed the information included in our financial guidance and provide net sales guidance based on sell-in revenue recognition under the new GAAP standard.

Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a record quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 36.70 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on March 6, 2020 to stockholders of record on February 21, 2020.

"We experienced strong bookings activity throughout the December 2019 quarter and upwardly revised our quarterly financial guidance twice after our original guidance on November 5, 2019," said Steve Sanghi, Chief Executive Officer. "Our December 2019 quarterly net sales were near the high end of our most recent guidance from January 6, 2020 at $1.287 billion, which was down 3.76% sequentially. Our non-GAAP gross margins were

61.5% and our non-GAAP operating margin were 35.1%, both of which were above the high-end of our most recent guidance range. We delivered $1.32 of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which was also above the high-end of our most recent guidance."

Mr. Sanghi added, "End-market demand, which reflects sell-through activities in the distribution channel, was $36.1 million higher than GAAP (sell-in) revenue in the December 2019 quarter, the seventh consecutive quarter that end-market demand has exceeded sell-in revenue. As a result, distribution inventory days declined during the quarter and are at very low levels."

"The end-market demand for our microcontroller business was down 1.1%, for our analog business was down 3.6% and for our FPGA business was flat compared to the September 2019 quarter. Microcontrollers represented 53.6%, analog represented 28.1% and FPGA represented 6.9% of our end-market demand in the December quarter. We continue to introduce a steady stream of new and innovative microcontroller, analog and FPGA solutions that we believe position us well for future growth," said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Operating Officer.

Mr. Moorthy added, "While our bookings and backlog trends have not changed since our business update press release on January 6, the Coronavirus situation is rapidly evolving and most Chinese provinces have extended the Chinese New Year holidays in response to the spread of the virus. We have taken preventive measures to help ensure the safety of our employees and have completed a first pass assessment of our supply chain and currently believe our risk is low. However, it is too early to determine the impact to our customers as many of them are still not back from their holidays. We continue to actively monitor the progression of the Coronavirus events and plan to take additional actions as needed."

Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, "We paid down $257.0 million of total debt during the December quarter, reflecting a cumulative pay down of almost $2 billion over the past six quarters, as we have actively managed the working capital requirements for the business. We will continue to use substantially all of our excess cash generation after dividends to reduce the amount of debt on our balance sheet as quickly as possible."

Mr. Sanghi concluded, "Our March quarter backlog is significantly higher than the December quarter backlog was at the same point in the quarter. We are experiencing an increased level of customer requested expedited shipments and we are calling the December 2019 quarter as the bottom of the cycle for Microchip barring any negative developments on the US/China trade front, or the impact of Coronavirus . Based on our analysis for our business and the current economic backdrop, we estimate our net sales in the March 2020 quarter to be up

between 2% and 9% sequentially. The midpoint of our guidance for the March 2020 quarter reflects what we believe our business can deliver assuming no extraordinary events. However, the wider than normal guidance range is to help account for the uncertainty associated with the evolving Coronavirus situation. We are still in the early days of how this situation is playing out. We have no way to model how the rest of the quarter will play out for the Coronavirus situation, and what the consequent business impact may be, but we believe that our guidance range incorporates our best judgment for the possible scenarios."

Microchip's Highlights for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2019:

•Introduced the radiation-tolerant PolarFire® FPGA, enabling high-throughput on-orbit processing space systems with very low power consumption and heat generation and optimized to meet the demanding requirements of spacecraft payload systems high-speed data paths.

•Announced easing the transition with IEEE 802.3bt-2018-compliant PoE injectors and midspans for users and power sourcing equipment chipsets for system developers that enable both pre-standard and IEEE-compliant PDs to receive up to 90W of power without changing switches or cabling.

•Announced industry support for development of the Open Compute Project’s Accelerator Infrastructure form factors and interconnects through its PCIe® Switches that provide high-performance connectivity to enable interoperable artificial intelligence (AI) hardware accelerators.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Outlook:

Beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019, we changed the information included in our financial guidance in response to comments from and discussions with the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are now providing net sales guidance based on sell-in revenue recognition under the new GAAP standard. We are also providing guidance and reporting non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage, operating profit percentages and diluted earnings per share based on sell-in GAAP revenue. We are also providing information on end-market demand so that investors will have information on the consumption in the marketplace of our products by our customers or our distributors. We do not use end-market demand for any of our non-GAAP income statement calculations. Please see "Use of End-Market Demand Metric" below for information on how we calculate end-market demand.

The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. We are not able to predict whether inventory at our distributors will increase or decrease and are therefore providing a range of GAAP net sales guidance. In recent years, we have seen net inventory at our distributors increase or decrease by a significant amount in a single quarter.

Use of End-Market Demand Metric: End-market demand is the net dollar amount of our products, licensing revenue and other services delivered to our direct (non-distributor) customers and by our distributors to their

customers. We are able to calculate end-market demand based on information that our distributors provide us about their product shipments to their customers and inventory holdings. The value of end-market demand from our distributors is calculated as the net transaction value of these shipments. We believe that our end-market demand metric reflects true end-market demand based on when product is sold to direct customers or by our distributors to an end customer. 

Under the new GAAP revenue recognition standard, we are required to recognize revenue when control of the product changes from us to a customer or distributor. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on creating demand for our products in the end markets we serve and not on moving inventory into our distribution network. Therefore, the elements of our internal performance and executive and employee compensation metrics that are based on sales and operating results are measured using the value of the end-market demand for our products. We use end-market demand for these purposes because we do not believe that the underlying value of our business benefits from increases in the value of inventory that is held in the supply chain. As many of our products are designed into customer applications with relatively long lives, such value is only realized when the end-market demand is created and the supply chain sells the inventory to the end customer. We believe the use of end-market demand is also important to investors and users of our financial statements as it reflects the final outcome of our sales activities whereas our GAAP net sales are based on estimates made earlier in (or before the end of) the process of creating and fulfilling demand is complete. We also manage our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including our distributor relationships, towards the goal of having our products available at the time and location the end customer desires. Management uses end-market demand to manage and assess the profitability of our business and when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose end-market demand metric because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it provides better information regarding end-market demand for our products. Therefore, we believe that it is useful to investors for us to disclose end-market demand. Our determination of end-market demand metric might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Our non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, severance and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), IT security remediation costs, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures, losses on the settlement of debt, and gains and losses on available-for-sale investments. For the third quarters of fiscal 2020 and 2019, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. Our other non-GAAP adjustments are either non-cash expenses, unusual or infrequent items or other expenses related to transactions. Management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.

We are using non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP other expense, net, and non-GAAP income tax rate, which exclude the items noted above, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.

Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of our business and for compensation purposes. We also use our non-GAAP results when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Our determination of these non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using these non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.

Generally, gross margin fluctuates over time, driven primarily by the mix of products sold and licensing revenue; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; costs of wafers from foundries; inventory reserves; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to net sales and profit levels.

Diluted Common Shares Outstanding can vary for, among other things, the trading price of our common stock, the exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the potential for incremental dilutive shares from our convertible debentures (additional information regarding our share count is available in the investor relations section of our website under the heading "Supplemental Financial Information"), and repurchases or issuances of

shares of our common stock. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table above assumes an average Microchip stock price in the March 2020 quarter between $100 and $110 per share (however, we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period and we cannot estimate what our stock option exercise activity will be during the quarter).
