Regulation FD Disclosure 

On February 14, 2020, National Storage REIT (“NSR”), an Australia-based publicly-traded REIT (ASX:NSR) that owns and operates 167 self-storage facilities in Australia and New Zealand, issued a press release regarding a non-binding proposal it received from Public Storage. 

Public Storage confirms that, as disclosed in the press release, it has submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of the issued stapled securities of NSR and its controlled entities for a cash purchase price of A$2.40 per share. 

The Public Storage proposal was non-binding and subject to a number of conditions, including due diligence. Public Storage’s discussions with NSR are preliminary in nature and any transaction would be subject to processes for acquisition of widely held entities under Australian law, including securityholder approval. There is no assurance that Public Storage will reach a definitive agreement or consummate a transaction with NSR or that if such an agreement is reached, it will be on terms similar to those set forth herein. 

Public Storage does not intend to provide additional or ongoing disclosure regarding these preliminary negotiations prior to any execution of a definitive agreement and expressly disclaims any obligation to update this information, except as required by law.
