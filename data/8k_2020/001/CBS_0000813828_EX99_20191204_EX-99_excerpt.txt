UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

On December 4, 2019, Viacom Inc. (“Viacom”) merged with and into CBS Corporation (“CBS”) (the “merger”) with CBS continuing as the surviving company, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated August 13, 2019 and as amended as of October 16, 2019 (the “merger agreement”). At the effective time of the merger (the “effective time”), the combined company changed its name to ViacomCBS Inc. (“ViacomCBS”). The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and notes thereto give effect to the merger. As a result of the merger, at the effective time, (1) each share of Viacom Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, other than shares held directly by Viacom as treasury shares or held by CBS, was converted automatically into 0.59625 shares of ViacomCBS Class A common stock and (2) each share of Viacom Class B common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, other than shares held directly by Viacom as treasury shares or held by CBS, was converted automatically into 0.59625 shares of ViacomCBS Class B common stock. The merger did not result in an exchange of outstanding shares of CBS common stock. However, since the name of CBS changed to ViacomCBS, at the effective time, each share of CBS Class A common stock and CBS Class B common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time remained an issued and outstanding share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock of ViacomCBS, respectively. 

The merger is being accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control as a result of National Amusements, Inc. (“NAI”) being the controlling stockholder of each of CBS and Viacom. Therefore, in the merger, the net assets of Viacom are combined with those of CBS at their historical carrying amounts and the companies are presented on a combined basis for historical periods because they were under common control for all periods presented. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect this presentation. 

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are derived from CBS’ and Viacom’s respective historical consolidated financial statements for each period presented. The historical fiscal year end of CBS was December 31. The historical fiscal year end of Viacom was September 30. As set forth in the merger agreement, the fiscal year end of ViacomCBS is December 31. Accordingly, in order to present the pro forma results of ViacomCBS on a December 31 fiscal year-end basis, the historical results of Viacom were recalendarized to conform to CBS’ presentation (see Note 2). The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are presented as if the merger occurred on January 1, 2016, which is the beginning of the earliest year for which pro forma financial statements are required to be presented. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is presented as if the merger occurred on September 30, 2019. 

These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the merger had been consummated on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial condition that may be expected for any future period or date. Accordingly, such information should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance, financial condition or liquidity. Additionally, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to revenue synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may be achieved with respect to the combined company. Actual results may differ materially from the assumptions within the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.

1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements give effect to the completion of the merger, which is being accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. NAI, through its direct and indirect majority ownership of CBS Class A common stock and Viacom Class A common stock, was the controlling stockholder of each of CBS and Viacom. As of September 30, 2019, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately 78.9% of CBS Class A common stock and approximately 79.8% of Viacom Class A common stock. Therefore, in the merger, the net assets of Viacom were combined with those of CBS at their historical carrying amounts and the companies are presented on a combined basis for historical periods because they were under common control for all periods presented. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect this presentation. 

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are derived from CBS’ and Viacom’s respective historical consolidated financial statements for each period presented. The historical amounts for Viacom reflect the recalendarization of Viacom’s historical statements of operations to a December 31 year end, and reclassification adjustments to conform to CBS’ presentation (see Note 2). The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are presented as if the merger occurred on January 1, 2016, which is the beginning of the earliest year for which pro forma financial statements are required to be presented. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is presented as if the merger occurred on September 30, 2019. 

The preparation of unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in such financial statements and the notes thereto. These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the merger had been consummated on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial condition that may be expected for any future period or date. Accordingly, such information should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance, financial condition or liquidity. Additionally, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to revenue synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may be achieved with respect to the combined company. Actual results may differ materially from the assumptions within the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. 

2) PRESENTATION OF HISTORICAL VIACOM

The historical amounts for Viacom in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented on a December 31 fiscal year-end basis and reflect reclassifications to conform to CBS’ presentation, as further described below. 

Alignment of Fiscal Year Ends 

The historical fiscal year end of CBS was December 31. The historical fiscal year end of Viacom was September 30. As set forth in the merger agreement, the fiscal year end of ViacomCBS is December 31. In order to present the pro forma results of ViacomCBS on a December 31 fiscal year-end basis, the historical results of Viacom presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations were calculated as follows: 

•For the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended September 30, 2019 contained in Viacom’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019, less the consolidated statement of earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2018 contained in Viacom’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2018; 

VIACOMCBS INC.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA 

CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

•For the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, plus the consolidated statements of earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and less the consolidated statements of earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The above statements of earnings were derived from Viacom’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the applicable periods. The statements of earnings information for the year ended December 31, 2016 has been updated for the impact of the retrospective adoption of ASU 2017-07-Compensation-Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which resulted in the reclassification of $3 million from “Selling, general and administrative” to “Other items, net”. 

Reclassifications 

The historical financial information of Viacom included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflects the following reclassifications to conform Viacom’s historical financial information to CBS’ presentation. 

Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet at September 30, 2019 

“Deferred income tax assets, net” of $194 million and “Pension and postretirement benefit obligations” of $671 million for Viacom were included within “Other assets” and “Other liabilities,” respectively, in Viacom’s historical financial statements. 

Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Operations 

Viacom reported “Equity in net earnings of investee companies” of $9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $69 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 within the subtotal of “Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes” and the corresponding income tax provisions of $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 were reported within “Provision for income taxes.” These amounts are being combined and reported within “Equity in earnings (loss) of investee companies, net of tax” on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations. 

In addition to the reclassifications described above, certain other line items in Viacom’s historical financial statements were condensed to conform to CBS’ presentation. 

3) CONFORMING THE ADOPTION DATES OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

As a result of the different fiscal year ends of CBS and Viacom, the two companies have adopted certain recent accounting pronouncements on different dates. CBS adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (which we refer to as “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (which we refer to as “ASC”) 842 on the accounting for leases on January 1, 2019, while as of September 30, 2019, Viacom had not yet adopted ASC 842. Under this guidance, a lease liability and a right-of-use asset, representing the right to use the underlying assets for the lease term, are recorded on the balance sheet for all leases with terms in excess of one year. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is adjusted for the estimated impact of ASC 842, assuming Viacom had adopted this standard as of January 1, 2019. The adjustments include an increase to “Operating lease assets” of $910 million and increases to “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” of $168 million and “Noncurrent operating lease liabilities” of $940 million, which represent the estimated present value of Viacom’s future lease payments as of September 30, 2019. The reductions to “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” of $34 million and $164 million

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA 

CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

reflect the current and non-current portions, respectively, of deferred rent liabilities and restructuring reserves recorded by Viacom under previous lease guidance. 

Additionally, FASB guidance on the recognition of revenues, ASC 606, was adopted by CBS on January 1, 2018 and by Viacom on October 1, 2018. This guidance provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. CBS and Viacom applied the modified retrospective method of adoption for this guidance, under which periods prior to adoption continue to be presented under previous revenue guidance. The effect of conforming Viacom’s adoption date for ASC 606 to CBS’ adoption date of January 1, 2018 would not have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, and therefore no pro forma adjustment has been made for the adoption of this guidance. 

CBS and Viacom also adopted FASB guidance on the accounting for financial instruments on January 1, 2018 and October 1, 2018, respectively. Among other provisions, this guidance requires the fair value measurement of equity investments. The effect of conforming Viacom’s adoption date for this guidance to CBS’ adoption date of January 1, 2018 would not have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, and therefore no pro forma adjustment has been made for the adoption of this guidance. 

4) INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been adjusted to eliminate transactions between CBS and Viacom. These transactions include the lease of production facilities, licensing of feature film and television content, the sale of advertising spots and the distribution by Viacom of certain television products into the home entertainment market on behalf of CBS. 

5) SHARE CONVERSION AND RELATED ACTIVITY

(a)As a result of the merger, at the effective time, (1) each share of Viacom Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, other than shares held directly by Viacom as treasury shares or held by CBS, was converted automatically into 0.59625 shares of ViacomCBS Class A common stock and (2) each share of Viacom Class B common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, other than shares held directly by Viacom as treasury shares or held by CBS, was converted automatically into 0.59625 shares of ViacomCBS Class B common stock. Since the merger is being accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control, the shares of ViacomCBS common stock issued in connection with the conversion are recorded at par value, which is $0.001 per share. The following table details the calculations of the number of shares of ViacomCBS common stock issued in the merger and the par value of ViacomCBS shares outstanding after the merger, assuming the merger occurred on September 30, 2019. On a rounded basis, the par value of ViacomCBS common stock did not change as a result of the issuance, and therefore no pro forma adjustment was required to “Common stock” on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet. 

VIACOMCBS INC.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA 

CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the merger, the name of CBS changed to “ViacomCBS Inc.” At the effective time, each share of CBS Class A common stock and CBS Class B common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time remained an issued and outstanding share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock of ViacomCBS, respectively. 

(b)Adjustments reflect the cancellation of all shares of Viacom common stock held as treasury shares in accordance with the merger agreement. 

(c)The pro forma weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding of Viacom have been calculated by adjusting the historical weighted average share amounts by the exchange ratio as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The historical basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for Viacom above have been weighted based on a fiscal year end of December 31, and therefore do not agree to the amounts included in Viacom’s historical consolidated financial statements included in its quarterly and annual filings, which were weighted based on a September 30 fiscal year end. 

6) MERGER-RELATED COSTS

(a)In connection with the merger, CBS and Viacom expect to incur approximately $124 million of additional transaction costs, consisting mainly of financial advisory, legal and other professional fees, after September 30, 2019. Such costs are reflected as an adjustment to “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities.” 

(b)CBS and Viacom incurred costs for contractual executive compensation triggered by the merger, which also includes the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation awards. Also as a result of the merger, 

VIACOMCBS INC.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA 

CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

CBS and Viacom expect to pay transaction-related bonuses. The adjustments of $22 million and $17 million to “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities,” respectively, reflect accruals for contractual executive compensation and transaction-related bonuses incurred from October 1, 2019 through the closing of the merger. The adjustment to “Additional paid in capital” of $15 million reflects the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The net impact of changes in ongoing executive compensation arrangements as a result of the merger was not material to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations and therefore no pro forma adjustment has been made. 

7) INCOME TAXES

The adjustment to “Benefit (provision) for income taxes” for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 reflects increases to the tax provision of $6 million related to the pro forma income tax effects of the reversal of the tax deductible portion of the merger-related costs incurred by CBS and Viacom described in Note 6 (d). The decreases to “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” of $15 million and “Deferred income tax liabilities, net” of $1 million reflect the impact to income taxes payable and deferred income taxes, respectively, for the tax deductible portion of the merger-related costs described in Note 6 (a) and (b). The pro forma adjustment to “Deferred income tax liabilities, net” was based on the respective deferred tax rates of CBS and Viacom. Combining the two companies is not expected to have a material impact on the deferred tax rate or the valuation allowances and therefore no additional pro forma tax adjustments have been made.
