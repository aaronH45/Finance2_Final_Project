CROWN CASTLE REPORTS FULL YEAR 2019 RESULTS,

UPDATES OUTLOOK FOR FULL YEAR 2020, AND ANNOUNCES RESTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL RESULTS

February 26, 2020 - HOUSTON, TEXAS - Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE: CCI) ("Crown Castle") today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2019, updated its full year 2020 Outlook, and announced the restatement of previously-issued financial statements.

(a)Attributable to CCIC common stockholders.

(b)See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations" included herein for further information and reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income (loss).

(c)Represents no change from the midpoint of full year 2020 Outlook issued on October 16, 2019 ("Previous 2020 Outlook") other than the impact of the restatement described in "Expected Impact of the Restatement of Previously-Issued Financial Statements."

(d)Results are preliminary and unaudited. See "Expected Impact of the Restatement of Previously-Issued Financial Statements" included herein for more information regarding the Company's restatement.

"In 2019, we experienced our highest level of tower leasing activity in more than a decade as the continued growth in mobile data demand is driving our customers to make significant investments in their existing 4G networks, while they are also positioning their businesses for 5G," stated Jay Brown, Crown Castle’s Chief Executive Officer. "We believe our ability to offer towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all integral components of communications networks and are shared among multiple tenants, provides us the best opportunity to generate significant growth while delivering high returns for our shareholders. We believe that the U.S. represents the best market in the world for communications infrastructure ownership, and we are pursuing that compelling opportunity with our comprehensive offering.

"Further, we delivered another strong year of results for full year 2019 despite a noticeable slowdown in activity in the fourth quarter of 2019. We anticipate that this slowdown is temporary in nature and see a return to significant activity in the second half of this year. We believe the industry fundamentals are improving further with the competitive landscape for our existing customers coming into focus, the prospect of new customers looking for access to our tower

and fiber infrastructure at scale, and additional wireless spectrum auctions on the horizon. As we look forward to what will likely be another decade-long investment cycle for our customers with the deployment of 5G, I am excited about the opportunity we see for Crown Castle to deliver long-term value to our shareholders while delivering dividend per share growth of 7% to 8% per year."

DISCUSSION OF TOWER INSTALLATION SERVICES REVENUES

In connection with our year-end procedures and after receiving the previously disclosed subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we engaged in a review internally, and in consultation with our independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), of our accounting policies for our tower installation services. Following that review, we decided with PwC to seek input from the SEC's Office of the Chief Accountant ("OCA") regarding whether a portion of our services revenues should be recognized over the term of the associated lease. The OCA is an office of the SEC that provides guidance to registrants and auditors regarding the application of accounting standards and financial disclosure requirements. The OCA provided advice on the specific revenue recognition question we submitted to them for their review and did not review or address any other aspect of our accounting policies. Our consultation with the OCA was not part of the previously disclosed SEC investigation, which is still ongoing, or the related subpoena, which primarily related to certain of our long-standing capitalization and expense policies for tenant upgrades and installations in our services business.

Our long-standing historical practice with respect to services revenues had been to recognize the entirety of the transaction price from our tower installation services as services revenues upon the completion of the installation services. After consultation with the OCA, we concluded that our historical practice was not acceptable under GAAP. Instead, a portion of the transaction price for our installation services, specifically the amounts associated with permanent improvements recorded as fixed assets, represents a modification to the leases to which the services work is related and, therefore, should be recognized on a ratable basis as site rental revenues over the associated estimated remaining lease term. Cumulatively, over the term of customer lease contracts, we will recognize the same amount of total revenue and total gross margin as our historical practice. 

The result of recognizing a portion of the transaction price on a ratable basis will be an increase to site rental revenues and site rental gross margins that offsets, over time, the decreases to services revenues and services gross margins, in both historical and future periods. As a result, the preliminary impact to each of Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO is a decrease of approximately $100 million for full year 2019 actuals and a decrease of approximately $90 million to our Previous 2020 Outlook. We have provided tables in this release to reconcile the changes. Recognizing a portion of the transaction price on a ratable basis for tower installation services will have no impact on our net cash flows, business operations or expected dividend per share growth. 

Due to the identified errors described above, we will restate our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and unaudited financial information for the quarterly and year-to-date periods in the year ended December 31, 2018 and for the first three quarters in the year ended December 31, 2019. Restated financial statements and financial information for the periods in question will be reflected in Crown Castle's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 ("2019 10-K"), which Crown Castle expects to file within the prescribed timeline for such report, including any available extension if needed to finalize the consolidated financial statements and disclosures and complete the associated audit work. 

Additional information relating to the restatement is provided in the section of this release titled, "Expected 

Impact of the Restatement of Previously-Issued Financial Statements."

RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 

The table below sets forth select preliminary unaudited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2019 that reflect the restatement described above.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Attributable to CCIC common stockholders.

(b)See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations" included herein for further information and reconciliation of this non-

GAAP financial measure to net income (loss).

(c)Results are preliminary and unaudited. See "Expected Impact of the Restatement of Previously-Issued Financial Statements" included herein for more information regarding the Company's restatement.

(d)Includes restatement of nine months ended September 30, 2019.

(e)As issued on October 16, 2019.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE YEAR[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures during the year were $2.1 billion, comprised of $53 million of land purchases, $117 million of sustaining capital expenditures, $1.9 billion of discretionary capital expenditures and $9 million of integration capital expenditures. The discretionary capital expenditures included approximately $1.4 billion attributable to Fiber and approximately $454 million attributable to Towers. 

•Common stock dividend. During 2019, Crown Castle paid common stock dividends of approximately $1.9 billion in the aggregate, or $4.575 per common share, an increase of approximately 7% on a per share basis compared to the same period a year ago.

"Our solid 2019 results and 2020 Outlook, which remains unchanged with the exception of the impact of the restatement we disclosed today, reflect the strong underlying demand for our communications infrastructure assets and our ability to translate growth in data demand into growth in dividends per share," stated Dan Schlanger, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. "Uncertainty around the outcome of the pending merger between T-Mobile and Sprint led to lower activity levels in the fourth quarter of 2019 that we believe will continue through the first quarter of 2020. However, we expect activity levels across the industry to increase throughout the year and potentially beyond as we believe our customers will accelerate their investments in 5G. As a result, we expect our financial performance in 2020 will be more back-end loaded than we previously expected, particularly for services contribution. Against that backdrop, we are excited about the growth trends across our business and the long-term opportunity in front of Crown Castle as we continue to target 7% to 8% annual growth in dividends per share."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Segment Measures and Other Calculations

This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Funds from Operations ("AFFO"), including per share amounts, Funds from Operations ("FFO"), including per share amounts, and Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")). 

Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the communications infrastructure sector or other real estate investment trusts ("REITs"). Our definition of FFO is consistent with guidelines from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts with the exception of the impact of income taxes in periods prior to our REIT conversion in 2014.

In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures used herein, we also provide Segment Site Rental Gross Margin, Segment Services and Other Gross Margin and Segment Operating Profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments. These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting. In addition, we provide the components of certain GAAP measures, such as capital expenditures.

Our non-GAAP financial measures are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our business. Among other things, management believes that:

•Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of the communications infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. 

•AFFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that AFFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as it includes (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt and dividends on our preferred stock) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures, and excludes the impact of our (a) asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) and (b) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. Management notes that Crown Castle uses AFFO only as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment. 

•FFO, including per share amounts, is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Management believes that FFO may be used by investors or other interested parties as a basis to compare our financial performance with that of other REITs. FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion). FFO is not a key performance indicator used by Crown Castle. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations.  

The pathway to possible.

News Release continued: Page 9

•Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is useful to investors or other interested parties in understanding the components of the year-over-year changes in our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. Management uses the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues to assess year-over-year growth rates for our rental activities, to evaluate current performance, to capture trends in rental rates, new leasing activities and tenant non-renewals in our core business, as well to forecast future results. Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues is not meant as an alternative measure of revenue and should be considered only as a supplement in understanding and assessing the performance of our site rental revenues computed in accordance with GAAP. 

We define our non-GAAP financial measures, segment measures and other calculations as follows:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other (income) expense, (benefit) provision for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, (income) loss from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. 

Adjusted Funds from Operations. We define Adjusted Funds from Operations as FFO before straight-lined revenue, straight-lined expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash portion of tax provision, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of non-cash interest expense, other (income) expense, (gains) losses on retirement of long-term obligations, net (gain) loss on interest rate swaps, (gains) losses on foreign currency swaps, acquisition and integration costs, and adjustments for noncontrolling interests, and less sustaining capital expenditures. 

AFFO per share. We define AFFO per share as AFFO divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.

Funds from Operations. We define Funds from Operations as net income plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset write-down charges, less noncontrolling interest and cash paid for preferred stock dividends, and is a measure of funds from operations attributable to CCIC common stockholders. 

FFO per share. We define FFO per share as FFO divided by the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. 

Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues. We define the Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues as the sum of the change in GAAP site rental revenues related to (1) new leasing activity, including revenues from the construction of small cells and the impact of prepaid rent, (2) escalators and less (3) non-renewals of tenant contracts. 

Segment Measures

Segment Site Rental Gross Margin. We define Segment Site Rental Gross Margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated site rental cost of operations. 

Segment Services and Other Gross Margin. We define Segment Services and Other Gross Margin as segment services and other revenues less segment services and other cost of operations, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated services and other cost of operations. 

Segment Operating Profit. We define Segment Operating Profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment services and other gross margin, less selling, general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment. 

All of these measurements of profit or loss are exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion, which are shown separately. Additionally, certain costs are shared across segments and are reflected in our segment measures through allocations that management believes to be reasonable. 

Other Calculations

Discretionary capital expenditures.  We define discretionary capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value. They primarily consist of expansion or development of communications infrastructure (including capital expenditures related to (1) enhancing communications infrastructure in order to add new tenants for the first time or support subsequent tenant equipment augmentations, or (2) modifying the structure of a communications infrastructure asset to accommodate additional tenants), and construction of new communications infrastructure. Discretionary capital expenditures also include purchases of land interests (which primarily relates to land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers), certain

technology-related investments necessary to support and scale future customer demand for our communications infrastructure, and other capital projects.

Integration capital expenditures. We define integration capital expenditures as those capital expenditures made as a result of integrating acquired companies into our business. 

Sustaining capital expenditures. We define sustaining capital expenditures as those capital expenditures not otherwise categorized as either discretionary or integration capital expenditures, such as (1) maintenance capital expenditures on our communications infrastructure assets that enable our tenants' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the communications infrastructure and (2) ordinary corporate capital expenditures. 

The tables set forth on the following pages reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures used herein to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.

Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains forward-looking statements and information that are based on our management's current expectations. Such statements include our Outlook and plans, projections, and estimates regarding (1) potential benefits, growth, returns, opportunities and tenant and shareholder value which may be derived from our business, assets, investments, acquisitions and dividends, (2) our strategy, business model and capabilities and the strength of our business, (3) industry fundamentals and driving factors for improvements in such fundamentals, (4) our customers' investment, including investment cycles, in network improvements and the trends driving such improvements, (5) our long-term prospects and the trends impacting our business (including growth in mobile data demand), (6) preliminary restatement of financial results, our restatement plans and the expected impact of such restatement, (7) management's intent to report in the 2019 10-K and create a remediation plan to address the material weakness(es) in Crown Castle's internal controls over financial reporting and its ineffective disclosure controls and procedures, (8) leasing environment and activity, including (a) timing and temporary nature of the leasing activity slowdown and our expectation for rebound in leasing activity and (b) growth in leasing activity and the contribution to our financial or operating results therefrom, (9) opportunities we see to deliver long-term value and dividend per share growth, (10) the status of the SEC investigation, (11) our dividends and our dividend (including on a per share basis) growth rate, including its driving factors, and targets, (12) our portfolio of assets, including demand therefor, strategic position thereof and opportunities created thereby, (13) assumed conversion of preferred stock and the impact therefrom, (14) expected timing for the closing of the proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, (15) amount of total revenue and total gross margin we expect to recognize cumulatively over the associated estimated remaining lease term, (16) timing of filing of the 2019 10-K, (17) cash flows, including growth thereof, (18) tenant non-renewals, including the impact and timing thereof, (19) capital expenditures, including sustaining and discretionary capital expenditures, and the timing thereof, (20) straight-line adjustments, (21) site rental revenues and estimated growth thereof, (22) site rental cost of operations, (23) net income (loss) (including on a per share basis) and estimated growth thereof, (24) Adjusted EBITDA, including the impact of the timing of certain components thereof and estimated growth thereof, (25) expenses, including interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, (26) FFO (including on a per share basis) and estimated growth thereof, (27) AFFO (including on a per share basis) and estimated growth thereof and corresponding driving factors, (28) Organic Contribution to Site Rental Revenues and its components, including contributions therefrom, (29) our weighted-average common shares outstanding (including on a diluted basis) and estimated growth thereof, (30) services contribution, including the timing thereof, (31) Segment Site Rental Gross Margin, (32) Segment Services and Other Gross Margin, (33) Segment Operating Profit and (34) the utility of certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions prevailing market conditions and the following:

•Our business depends on the demand for our communications infrastructure, driven primarily by demand for data, and we may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand. Additionally, a reduction in the amount or change in the mix of network investment by our tenants may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our communications infrastructure or services).

•A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of tenants, and the loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of such tenants may materially decrease revenues or reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and services.

•The expansion or development of our business, including through acquisitions, increased product offerings or other strategic growth opportunities, may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial results. 

•Our Fiber segment has expanded rapidly, and the Fiber business model contains certain differences from our Towers business model, resulting in different operational risks. If we do not successfully operate our Fiber business model or identify or manage the related operational risks, such operations may produce results that are lower than anticipated.

•Failure to timely and efficiently execute on our construction projects could adversely affect our business.

•Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business, and the terms of our debt instruments and our 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock limit our ability to take a number of actions that our management might otherwise believe to be in our best interests. In addition, if we fail to comply with our covenants, our debt could be accelerated. 

•We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In the event we do not repay or refinance such indebtedness, we could face substantial liquidity issues and might be required to issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, or sell some of our assets to meet our debt payment obligations.

•Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

•As a result of competition in our industry, we may find it more difficult to negotiate favorable rates on our new or renewing tenant contracts.

•New technologies may reduce demand for our communications infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues.

•If we fail to retain rights to our communications infrastructure, including the land interests under our towers and the right-of-way and other agreements related to our small cells and fiber, our business may be adversely affected.

•Our services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand, which reduces the predictability of our results.

•New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by tenants as rapidly or in the manner projected.

•If we fail to comply with laws or regulations which regulate our business and which may change at any time, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business.

•If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our communications infrastructure are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs or revenues.

•Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and operative agreements, and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.

•We may be vulnerable to security breaches or other unforeseen events that could adversely affect our operations, business, and reputation.

•We have concluded that certain of our previously-issued consolidated financial statements should not be relied upon and we have restated such previously-issued consolidated financial statements, which may result in loss of investor confidence, negative impact on our stock price, shareholder litigation, and certain other risks.

•We identified one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate such material weakness(es), or if we experience additional material weaknesses or other deficiencies in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results, in which case our business may be harmed, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the stock price may decline.

•Future dividend payments to our stockholders will reduce the availability of our cash on hand available to fund future discretionary investments, and may result in a need to incur indebtedness or issue equity securities to fund growth opportunities. In such event, the then current economic, credit market or equity market conditions will impact the availability or cost of such financing, which may hinder our ability to grow our per share results of operations.

•Remaining qualified to be taxed as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Failure to remain qualified as a REIT would result in our inability to deduct dividends to stockholders when computing our taxable income, which would reduce our available cash.

•If we fail to pay scheduled dividends on our 6.875% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (prior to the automatic conversion in August 2020), in cash, common stock, or any combination of cash and common stock, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our status as a REIT.

•Complying with REIT requirements, including the 90% distribution requirement, may limit our flexibility or cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities, including certain discretionary investments and potential financing alternatives.

•REIT related ownership limitations and transfer restrictions may prevent or restrict certain transfers of our capital stock.

Should one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is included in our filings with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are available through the SEC website at www.sec.gov or through our investor relations website at investor.crowncastle.com. We use our investor relations website to disclose information about us that may be deemed to be material. We encourage investors, the media and others interested in us to visit our investor relations website from time to time to review up-to-date information or to sign up for e-mail alerts to be notified when new or updated information is posted on the site. 

As used in this release, the term "including," and any variation thereof, means "including without limitation."

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (UNAUDITED)

(Amounts in millions, except par values)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted new guidance on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments for all leases, and a corresponding right-of-use asset. The accounting for lessors remained largely unchanged from previous guidance. As a result of the new guidance for leases, on the effective date, certain amounts related to our lessee arrangements that were previously reported separately have been de-recognized and reclassified into "Operating lease right-of-use assets" on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.

Expected Impact of Restatement on Previously-Issued Financial Statements

As a result of the identified errors described above, we will restate our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and unaudited financial information for the quarterly and year-to-date periods in the year ended December 31, 2018 and for the first three quarters in the year ended December 31, 2019. We refer to the adjustments to correct the historical errors as "Restatement Adjustments."

In addition to the Restatement Adjustments, we have also made other adjustments to the financial statements referenced above to correct errors which were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our consolidated financial statements. All such immaterial adjustments relate exclusively to our Towers segment. Collectively, we refer to the Restatement Adjustments and immaterial adjustments as "Historical Adjustments." 

We will also restate selected historical consolidated financial and other data for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 to reflect the impact of the Historical Adjustments. Restated financial statements and selected historical consolidated financial and other data for such periods will be reflected in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which we expect to file within the prescribed timeline for such report, including any available extension if needed to finalize the consolidated financial statements and disclosures and complete the associated audit work.

Preliminary Restatement of Previously-Issued Annual Financial Statements

This section summarizes the expected unaudited effects of the Company's restatement to certain of its previously-issued annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. "As Reported" amounts represent amounts as previously reported on the Company’s respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K. The following tables also reflect the expected unaudited impact of the Historical Adjustments, where applicable, on each annual period below.
