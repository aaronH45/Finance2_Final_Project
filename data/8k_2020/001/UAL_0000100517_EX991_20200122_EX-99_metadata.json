        "24 Appendix A: reconciliation of GAAP to Non - GAAP financial measures (continued) CASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline’s cost structure and efficiency. UAL reports CASM exc luding special charges, third - party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing. UAL believes that adjusting for special charges is useful to investors because special charges are not indicative of UAL’s ongoin g p erformance. UAL also believes that excluding third - party business expenses, such as maintenance, ground handling and catering services for third parties and fuel sales, provides more meaningful disclosure beca use these expenses are not directly related to UAL’s core business. UAL also believes that excluding fuel costs from certain measures is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management’s p erf ormance excluding the effects of a significant cost item over which management has limited influence. UAL excludes profit sharing because this exclusion allows investors to better understand and analyze our o per ating cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry.

(c) Both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors and are therefore beyond the Co mpa ny’s control."
