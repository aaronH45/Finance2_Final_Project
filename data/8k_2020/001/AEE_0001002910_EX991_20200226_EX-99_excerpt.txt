and Issues Guidance for 2020 Earnings and Long-Term Growth[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

ST. LOUIS (Feb. 26, 2020) — Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced 2019 net income attributable to common shareholders in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $828 million, or $3.35 per diluted share, compared to 2018 GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders of $815 million, or $3.32 per diluted share. Ameren recorded 2018 core earnings of $828 million, or $3.37 per diluted share, excluding the tax-related item reflected below. There were no differences between GAAP and core earnings for 2019.

Earnings results for 2019 were driven by strong operating performance and execution of the company's strategy. Higher earnings were the result of increased infrastructure investments across all business segments, as well as higher electric energy efficiency investments and natural gas delivery rates at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution and Natural Gas, respectively. In addition, the successful execution of energy efficiency programs at Ameren Missouri drove higher performance incentives over 2018. Earnings were negatively impacted by lower electric retail sales at Ameren Missouri due to near-normal temperatures in 2019 compared to significantly warmer summer and colder winter temperatures in 2018, as well as by a lower allowed return on equity at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. Earnings in 2019 also benefited from a lower consolidated effective income tax rate compared to 2018. 

"In 2019, we continued to execute on all elements of our strategy across our businesses," said Warner L. Baxter, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. “Our team continues to execute projects associated with our robust energy infrastructure investment plan very well, while at the same time keeping rates

affordable for our customers. These investments will deliver significant long-term value for our customers through a more reliable, resilient, secure and cleaner energy grid."

"I am also pleased to report that today Ameren Missouri files its updated five-year Smart Energy Plan with the Missouri Public Service Commission, which includes significant investments to modernize the electric grid, as well as to expand its renewable energy generation portfolio for the benefit of our customers while keeping rates stable and predictable," Baxter said. "Grid modernization investments in our Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution business have been delivering significant benefits to customers in the state of Illinois for years, and investments made under the Smart Energy Plan filed in 2019 are already delivering customer benefits and creating new jobs in the state of Missouri."

Ameren recorded net income attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2019, of $94 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $68 million, or 28 cents per diluted share, for the same period in 2018. 

The year-over-year increase in fourth quarter 2019 earnings was due to increased infrastructure investments across all of our business segments, lower operating expenses at our non-nuclear energy centers at Ameren Missouri and charitable donations in 2019 returning to more normal levels. These earnings increases were offset in part by lower electric retail sales due to near-normal temperatures in 2019 compared to the colder-than-normal temperatures in 2018, as well as lower energy efficiency performance incentives at Ameren Missouri.

As reflected in the table below, in 2018 there was a non-cash charge for a true-up to the revaluation of deferred taxes associated with the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) resulting primarily from proposed regulations related to bonus depreciation issued in August 2018, which decreased 2018 earnings by $13 million.

Earnings and Rate Base Guidance

Ameren expects 2020 diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $3.40 to $3.60. Ameren also affirms its 2018 through 2023 compound annual earnings per share growth expectations of 6% to 8%, using $3.05 per share as the base. This base is 2018 core diluted earnings per share of $3.37, less the 2018 Ameren Missouri estimated favorable weather impact of 32 cents per diluted share. In addition, Ameren also expects diluted earnings per share to grow at a 6% to 8% compound annual rate from 2020 through 2024, using the 2020 guidance range midpoint of $3.50 per share as the base. Ameren's expected multi-year earnings growth is expected to be driven by strong projected rate base growth of approximately 9% compounded annually from 2019 through 2024.

"Looking ahead, we will remain focused on the sustainable execution of our strategy, which we believe will continue to deliver superior value to our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders by investing in a robust pipeline of critical energy infrastructure projects, while keeping customer rates affordable," Baxter said. 

Ameren's earnings guidance for 2020 and multi-year growth expectations assume normal temperatures and are subject to the effects of, among other things: 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields; regulatory, judicial and legislative actions; energy center and energy distribution operations; energy, economic, capital and credit market conditions; severe storms; unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses; and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release. 

Ameren Missouri Segment Results

Ameren Missouri 2019 GAAP and core earnings were $426 million, compared to 2018 GAAP and core earnings of $478 million and $482 million, respectively. Core earnings in 2018 excluded a $4 million non-cash charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes. The year-over-year comparison reflected lower electric retail sales, which decreased earnings by an estimated $64 million, primarily due to near-normal temperatures in 2019 compared to significantly warmer summer and colder winter temperatures in 2018. In addition, the Callaway Energy Center refueling and maintenance outage decreased earnings by $21 million compared to 2018 when there was no such outage. Higher property tax expenses also decreased earnings in 2019. These factors were partially offset by lower other operations and maintenance expenses including higher-than-normal scheduled non-nuclear plant outages and increased routine maintenance work in 2018. In addition, energy efficiency performance incentives were higher in 2019.

Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution Segment Results

Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution 2019 GAAP and core earnings were $146 million, compared to 2018 GAAP and core earnings of $136 million and $139 million, respectively. Core earnings in 2018 excluded a $3 million non-cash charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes. The year-over-year improvement reflected increased earnings on infrastructure and energy efficiency investments, largely offset by a lower allowed return on equity due to a lower average 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield in 2019 compared to 2018. 

Ameren Illinois Natural Gas Segment Results

Ameren Illinois Natural Gas 2019 GAAP and core earnings were $84 million, compared to 2018 GAAP and core earnings of $70 million and $71 million, respectively. Core earnings in 2018 excluded a $1 million non-cash charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes. The year-over-year improvement reflected higher delivery service rates effective in November 2018 and increased earnings on infrastructure investments.

Ameren Transmission Segment Results

Ameren Transmission 2019 earnings were $185 million, compared to 2018 earnings of $164 million. The year-over-year improvement reflected increased earnings on infrastructure investments.

Ameren Parent Results (includes items not reported in a business segment)

Ameren Parent results for 2019 reflected a GAAP and core loss of $13 million, compared to a 2018 GAAP and core loss of $33 million and $28 million, respectively. Core results for 2018 excluded a $5 million non-cash charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes. The year-over-year improvement reflected higher tax benefits primarily associated with share-based compensation, and charitable donations in 2019 returning to more normal levels.

Analyst Conference Call

Ameren will conduct a conference call for financial analysts at 9 a.m. Central Time on Wednesday, Feb. 26, to discuss 2019 earnings, earnings guidance and other matters.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In this release, Ameren has presented core earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to that of other companies. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP information is included in this presentation. Generally, core earnings or losses include earnings or losses attributable to Ameren common shareholders and exclude income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as the third quarter 2018 non-cash charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from a December 2017 change in federal law that decreased the federal corporate income tax rate. Ameren uses core earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core earnings as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding its earnings results and outlook, as the company believes that core earnings allow the company to more accurately compare its ongoing performance across periods.
