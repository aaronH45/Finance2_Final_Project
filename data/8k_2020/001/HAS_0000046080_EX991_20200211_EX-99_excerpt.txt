Pawtucket, R.I., February 11, 2020 -- Hasbro, Inc. today reported financial results for the full-year and fourth quarter 2019. 

“The global Hasbro team delivered a good year and achieved key objectives we set for 2019. We profitably grew revenues across regions absent foreign exchange supported by the successful execution of our channel strategy; we delivered growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING driven by the successful launch of Arena and we executed at a high level during the holiday season," said Brian Goldner, Hasbro’s chairman and chief executive officer. "Our acquisition of Entertainment One accelerates our Brand Blueprint strategy and significantly expands our expertise and capabilities as a global play and entertainment company. Our teams are actively engaged to unlock value across our organization - in gaming, in toys, in consumer products and in entertainment." 

“Our teams worked extremely hard and executed at a high level this holiday, driving fourth quarter and full-year revenue and profit growth while also diversifying our supply chain and preparing to close a major acquisition,” said Deborah Thomas, Hasbro’s chief financial officer. "We are strongly positioned to continue investing in long-term drivers of the business, including brand innovation, gaming and entertainment, as we also focus on returning to our stated gross Debt to EBITDA target of 2.0 to 2.5X over the next 3 to 4 years."

Full-Year 2019 Financial Results

Net revenues for the full-year 2019 increased 3% to $4.72 billion versus $4.58 billion in 2018. Net revenues increased 5% excluding an unfavorable $78.5 million impact of foreign exchange.

Net earnings for the full-year 2019 were $520.5 million, or $4.05 per diluted share, compared to $220.4 million, or $1.74 per diluted share, in 2018. The incremental interest expense and additional shares issued to finance the eOne acquisition impacted full-year 2019 by $0.08 per diluted share. Adjusted 2019 net earnings were $524.7 million, or $4.08 per diluted share, excluding aggregate after-tax net charges of $4.2 million. These after-tax charges consisted of a pension settlement charge of $86.0 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, partially offset by a net gain of $81.8 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, relating to foreign currency gains as a result of hedging part of the British Pound purchase price of eOne and other eOne acquisition costs. 

Adjusted 2018 net earnings were $488.8 million, or $3.85 per diluted share, excluding after-tax charges of $268.4 million, or $2.11 per diluted share.

Fourth quarter 2019 net revenues included an unfavorable $13.0 million impact from foreign exchange. Fourth quarter revenue was bolstered by strong demand for Hasbro's products for Disney's Frozen 2 and Star Wars.

Net earnings for the fourth quarter 2019 were $267.3 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, compared to $8.8 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2018.

Full-Year 2019 Major Segment Performance1

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1Full-year 2018 segment operating profit is as reported. Adjusted segment operating profit excludes Non-GAAP adjustments. A reconciliation is in the attached schedule “Reconciliation of Operating Profit Results.” 

2The Entertainment and Licensing segment is now the Entertainment, Licensing and Digital segment. For the year ended December 30, 2018, Wizards of the Coast digital gaming revenues of $57.8 million, and operating profit of $11.8 million, were reclassified from the U.S. and Canada Segment to the Entertainment, Licensing and Digital segment. 

Full-year 2019 U.S. and Canada segment net revenues increased 3% to $2.45 billion compared to $2.38 billion in 2018. Partner Brands and Emerging Brands revenue increased while Franchise Brands and Hasbro Gaming declined. The segment reported operating profit of $415.4 million versus $370.2 million in 2018, and versus $416.0 million in 2018 on an adjusted basis. Operating profit margin declined on an adjusted basis due to increased revenues from lower margin partner brand products, as well as higher supply chain expenses to support higher domestic just-in-time inventory requirements. 

International segment net revenues for the full-year 2019 were $1.84 billion compared to $1.85 billion in 2018. Excluding a negative $76.5 million impact of foreign exchange, International segment revenues increased 4%. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Within the International segment, Partner Brands revenue grew while Franchise Brands, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands declined. The International segment reported 2019 operating profit of $107.3 million compared to $39.5 million in 2018, and versus $47.1 million in 2018 on an adjusted basis. Profit growth was driven by favorable product mix, lower allowances from reduced retail inventory levels, a decline in advertising and savings realized from the 2018 organizational changes, partially offset by higher royalty expense.

Full-year 2019 Entertainment, Licensing and Digital segment net revenues increased 22% to $434.5 million compared to $356.3 million in 2018. Revenue growth was broad based and fueled by the first full year of Magic: The Gathering Arena, Hasbro's share of revenues from the Transformers: Bumblebee film earned to date, consumer products revenue growth and higher digital gaming licensing revenues. This was partly offset by lower digital streaming revenues versus 2018's multi-year digital streaming deal for Hasbro television programming. Operating profit increased to $99.7 million versus $29.1 million in 2018. Excluding a pre-tax $86.3 million non-cash fourth quarter 2018 goodwill impairment charge related to Backflip Studios, adjusted 2018 operating profit was $115.4 million. The decline in adjusted operating profit reflected investments in digital gaming initiatives, including Magic: The Gathering Arena and future digital games, lower digital streaming revenues and higher program production amortization. 

Full-Year 2019 Brand Portfolio Performance

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1Hasbro’s total gaming category, including all gaming revenue, most notably MAGIC: THE GATHERING and MONOPOLY which are included in Franchise Brands in the table above, totaled $1.53 billion for the full-year 2019, up 6% versus $1.44 billion for the full-year 2018. Hasbro believes its gaming portfolio is a competitive differentiator and views it in its entirety. 

Franchise Brands revenue decreased 1% to $2.41 billion. MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MONOPOLY and PLAY-DOH revenues increased for the year, while NERF, MY LITTLE PONY, BABY ALIVE and TRANSFORMERS declined. Franchise Brands revenue declined in the U.S. and Canada and International segments, but grew in the Entertainment, Licensing and Digital segment behind growth in Magic: The Gathering Arena and Transformers: Bumblebee revenues. 

Partner Brands revenue increased 24% to $1.22 billion. Revenues for Hasbro's line of Disney's Frozen 2 product along with increases in Hasbro's products for Marvel's Avengers and Spider-Man franchises drove much of the growth. Star Wars revenue growth was strong in the fourth quarter and drove full-year growth for the brand. Partner Brand revenues increased in the U.S. and Canada and International segments. 

Hasbro Gaming revenue decreased 10% to $709.8 million. Revenue gains from DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and several classic games titles were more than offset by declines in other games, including PIE FACE and SPEAK OUT. Hasbro Gaming revenues decreased in all three operating segments. As noted above, Hasbro’s total gaming category increased 6% to $1.53 billion. 

Emerging Brands revenue increased 5% to $377.6 million driven by shipments of POWER RANGERS and PLAYSKOOL, including MR. POTATO HEAD, offset by declines in LITTLEST PET SHOP and Quick Strike collectible offerings. Emerging Brands revenue grew in the U.S. and Canada segment and Entertainment, Licensing and Digital segment, but declined in the International segment. Absent the negative impact of foreign exchange, Emerging Brands revenues grew in the International segment. 

Dividends and Share Repurchases 

The Company paid $336.6 million in cash dividends to shareholders during 2019. The next quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.68 per common share is scheduled for May 15, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 1, 2020. 

During 2019, Hasbro repurchased 702,125 shares of common stock at a total cost of $61.4 million and an average price of $87.41. At year-end, $366.6 million remained available in the current share repurchase authorization. In recognition of the financing for the eOne acquisition, the Company suspended its share repurchase program while it prioritizes achieving its gross Debt to EBITDA target of 2.00 to 2.50X.
