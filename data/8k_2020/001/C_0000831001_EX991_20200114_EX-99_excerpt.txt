           CEO COMMENTARY   

 FOURTH QUARTER 2019: 

 NET INCOME OF $5.0 BILLION ($2.15 PER SHARE) 

 REVENUES OF $18.4 BILLION 

 RETURNED $6.2 BILLION OF CAPITAL TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS 

 ($22.3 BILLION IN FULL YEAR 2019)

 (264 MILLION IN FULL YEAR 2019) 

 BOOK VALUE PER SHARE OF $82.90 

 TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER SHARE OF $70.395 

 New York, January 14, 2020 – Citigroup Inc. today reported net income for the fourth quarter 2019 of $5.0 billion, or $2.15 per diluted share, on revenues of $18.4 billion. This compared to net income of $4.3 billion, or $1.64 per diluted share, on revenues of $17.1 billion for the fourth quarter 2018. 

 Revenues increased 7% from the prior-year period, with strong results across both the Institutional Clients Group (ICG) and Global Consumer Banking (GCB). Net income increased 15% from the prior-year period, driven by the higher revenues and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher expenses and cost of credit. Earnings per share of $2.15 increased 31% from the prior-year period, primarily driven by a 10% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding and the growth in net income. These results include a net benefit of approximately $0.25 per share in the current quarter related to discrete tax items, recorded in Corporate / Other 6. 

 For the full year 2019, Citigroup reported net income of $19.4 billion on revenues of $74.3 billion, compared to net income of $18.0 billion on revenues of $72.9 billion for the full year 2018. 

 Percentage comparisons throughout this press release are calculated for the fourth quarter 2019 versus the fourth quarter 2018, unless otherwise specified.        

 Citi CEO Michael Corbat said, “Our earnings of $5 billion for the fourth quarter marked a strong finish to 2019. Our full year Return on Tangible Common Equity of over 12% exceeded our target. Due to good client engagement, we drove balanced growth across our products and geographies, closing the year with 16 consecutive quarters of loan and deposit growth. The U.S. consumer franchise saw continued strong growth in Branded Cards and sustained its momentum in attracting digital deposits. Investment Banking continued to gain share and, despite a lower rate environment, Treasury and Trade Solutions grew revenue as we work to ensure our global network remains indispensable to our clients. With increased revenues and disciplined expense management, we had positive operating leverage, even as we continued to make significant investments in the franchise. 

 “We ended 2019 with a Common Equity Tier One ratio of 11.7% and we are on track to deliver our commitment of returning over $60 billion of capital to our shareholders over a three-year period. We enter 2020 in a strong competitive position, from capital and liquidity to talent and technology. We continue to invest in areas where we see opportunities for client-led growth and in our infrastructure, in light of the enduring need to be an indisputably strong and stable institution,” Mr. Corbat concluded.
