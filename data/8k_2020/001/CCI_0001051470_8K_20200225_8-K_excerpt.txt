ITEM 2.02 — RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

On February 26, 2020, Crown Castle International Corp. ("Company") issued a press release disclosing its financial results for fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2019. The February 26, 2020 press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.

ITEM 4.02 — NON-RELIANCE ON PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR A RELATED AUDIT REPORT OR COMPLETED INTERIM REVIEW

(a)

Correction of Errors in Previously Issued Financial Statements

Following review of the Company's accounting policies for tower installation services, we identified historical errors related to the timing of revenue recognition for such services. Due to these errors, on February 25, 2020, the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, after considering the recommendation of management and after discussion with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, concluded that the following financial statements previously issued by the Company should no longer be relied upon: (1) audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for years ended December 31, 2016 through and including 2018 and (2) unaudited financial statements and related disclosures for the quarterly and year-to-date periods during 2018 and for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2019. As a result, the Company is restating its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and unaudited financial information for the quarterly and year-to-date periods in the year ended December 31, 2018 and for the first three quarters in the year ended December 31, 2019. The restatement also affects periods prior to 2017, and the cumulative effect of the errors is expected to be reflected in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 ("2019 10-K") as an adjustment to opening “Dividends/distributions in excess of earnings” as of January 1, 2017. 

The restated financial statements and financial information will be included in the 2019 10-K, which the Company expects to file by the time period prescribed for such filing, including any available extension if needed to finalize the consolidated financial statements and disclosures and complete the associated audit work. Specifically, the Company intends to include in its 2019 10‑K, the restated 2018 and 2017 year-end financial statements in its consolidated financial statements and include the restated quarterly financial information in the unaudited quarterly financial information note to the consolidated financial statements. The Company does not intend to file amended Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to reflect the restatement. 

Identification of Material Weakness

The Company has determined that the restatement of the Company's previously issued financial statements as described above indicates the existence of one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and that the Company's internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of December 31, 2019. The Company will report the material weakness(es) in its 2019 10-K and intends to create a plan of remediation to address the material weakness(es).

ITEM 7.01 — REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE

The press release referenced in Item 2.02 above refers to certain supplemental information that was posted as a supplemental information package on the Company's website on February 26, 2020. The supplemental information package is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.2.
