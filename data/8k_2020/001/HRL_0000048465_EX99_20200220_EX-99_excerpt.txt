COMMENTARY

"Organic sales growth met our expectations this quarter as three of our four segments delivered volume and sales growth," said Jim Snee, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer. "It is encouraging to see Jennie-O Turkey Store deliver a second consecutive quarter of volume, sales and profit growth while continuing to gain back Jennie-O® lean ground turkey distribution. We are also seeing the strategic capital and marketing investments lead to strong growth from brands such as SPAM®, Hormel® Black Label®, Fontanini®, Hormel® Bacon 1TM and Hormel® Fire BraisedTM." 

"The Refrigerated Foods business model performed as anticipated, given the volatile commodity market conditions. Growth was driven by another strong quarter from our foodservice team and higher commodity profits," Snee said. "Volatile pork and beef trim prices also impacted profitability across many product lines in Grocery Products."

STRATEGIC INVESTMENT

"This morning we separately announced an agreement to acquire Sadler's Smokehouse, an authentic pit-smoked meats company based in Henderson, Texas. The company has been one of our trusted suppliers for over two decades, and we have been fortunate to build a relationship with the Sadler family," Snee said. "Authentic barbeque is on trend and continues to show excellent growth on restaurant menus across the nation. This acquisition perfectly aligns with our strategic initiative of strengthening our position in foodservice and gives us another highly differentiated branded product line, similar to what we have with Burke pizza toppings and Fontanini Italian meats and sausages. We also see a unique opportunity to further extend the Sadler's product line into the retail and deli channels. We are excited to welcome the Sadler's Smokehouse team members to the Hormel Foods family and look forward to their contributions."

The acquisition is expected to close in March 2020, subject to customary closing conditions. The acquisition is expected to be neutral to slightly negative to fiscal 2020 earnings, as the company plans to make immediate investments into the business and production facility. Annual sales, excluding transfers to Hormel Foods, are approximately $140 million, and operating margins are in line with the total company average. The purchase price is $270 million, and the company will fund the acquisition with cash on hand.

FISCAL 2020 OUTLOOK

"We are reaffirming our fiscal 2020 sales and earnings guidance," Snee said. "We have strong fundamentals in Refrigerated Foods and clear momentum at Jennie-O Turkey Store. We expect both segments to contribute meaningfully to our growth this year. While many Grocery Products brands, such as SPAM®, Wholly® and Herdez®, are performing well, we have additional work to do on the SKIPPY® spreads and Hormel® chili businesses. Our International team continues to manage through African swine fever, tariffs and the uncertainty caused by the recent outbreak of coronavirus in China. We have started to see a negative impact on our business in China from the coronavirus outbreak, but we are not yet able to forecast the impact for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we expect the International results to be offset by strong performances from Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store."

 Fiscal 2020 Outlook

Net Sales Guidance (in billions) $9.50 - $10.30

Earnings Per Share Guidance$1.69 - $1.83

SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS – FIRST QUARTER

Refrigerated Foods

•Volume up 3%

•Net sales up 6%

•Segment profit up 3% 

Volume and sales increased on strong demand for value-added products. Foodservice sales of Hormel® Bacon 1TM fully cooked bacon and Hormel® Fire BraisedTM products, retail sales of Hormel® Black Label® bacon and Hormel® Cure 81® ham, and deli sales of Hormel® Gatherings® party trays contributed to sales growth. Applegate® branded items in retail and foodservice also contributed to volume and sales growth. Higher raw material costs across the value-added businesses were more than offset by increased commodity profits.

Grocery Products

•Volume down 14%; organic volume1 down 4% 

•Net sales down 11%; organic net sales1 down 1% 

•Segment profit down 28%

Volume and sales decreases were primarily related to the divestiture of CytoSport. On an organic basis, growth from product lines such as the SPAM® family of products and Wholly® guacamole dips did not offset declines from SKIPPY® products. Segment profit declined, driven by the CytoSport divestiture, higher raw material costs, lower contract manufacturing profits and decreased volumes. As a reminder, Grocery Products benefited from a legal settlement in fiscal 2019.

2

Jennie-O Turkey Store

•Volume up 8%

•Net sales up 3%

•Segment profit up 2% 

Sales increased due to higher commodity and whole-bird volume and pricing. Jennie-O® lean ground tray pack volume increased as incremental distribution was regained during the quarter. Segment profit increased due to higher commodity profits and operational improvements.

International & Other

•Volume up 5%; organic volume1 up 7% 

•Net sales up 5%; organic net sales1 up 7% 

•Segment profit down 20% 

Volume and sales increased, driven by higher fresh pork export volume and strong demand in China. Segment profit decreased due to significantly higher pork raw material costs for our businesses in Brazil, China, and other Asian countries such as South Korea and the Philippines.

1 COMPARISON OF U.S. GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASUREMENTS

The non-GAAP adjusted financial measurements of organic net sales and organic volume are presented to provide investors with additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. The company believes these non-GAAP financial measurements provide useful information to investors because they are the measurements used to evaluate performance on a comparable year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP measurements are not intended to be a substitute for U.S. GAAP measurements in analyzing financial performance. These non-GAAP measurements are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Organic net sales and organic volume are defined as net sales and volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Organic net sales and organic volume exclude the impacts of the CytoSport divestiture (April 2019) in the Grocery Products and International & Other segments. The tables below show the calculations to reconcile from the GAAP measures to the non-GAAP adjusted measures in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
