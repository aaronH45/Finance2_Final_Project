Forward - looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subje ct to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements. Suc h r isks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (a) uncertainties regarding the planned separation, including whether it will be completed pursuant to the targeted timing, asset pe rimeters, and other anticipated terms, if at all; (b) the impact of the separation on the businesses of Howmet Aerospace; (c) the risk that the businesses will not be separated successfully or such separation may be more difficult, time - consuming or costly than expected, which could result in additional demands on Howmet Aerospace’s resources, systems, procedures and contr ols , disruption of its ongoing business, and diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; (d) deterioration in global economic and financial market conditions gen era lly; (e) unfavorable changes in the markets served by Howmet Aerospace; (f) the inability to achieve the level of revenue growth, cash generation, cost savings, improvement in pro fit ability and margins, fiscal discipline, or strengthening of competitiveness and operations anticipated or targeted; (g) competition from new product offerings, disruptive technologies o r o ther developments; (h) political, economic, and regulatory risks relating to Howmet Aerospace’s global operations, including compliance with U.S. and foreign trade and tax laws, sancti ons , embargoes and other regulations; (i) manufacturing difficulties or other issues that impact product performance, quality or safety; (j) Howmet Aerospace’s inability to realize exp ected benefits, in each case as planned and by targeted completion dates, from acquisitions, divestitures, facility closures, curtailments, expansions, or joint ventures; (k) the im pac t of potential cyber attacks and information technology or data security breaches; (l) the loss of significant customers or adverse changes in customers’ business or financial conditions; ( m) adverse changes in discount rates or investment returns on pension assets; (n) the impact of changes in aluminum prices and foreign currency exchange rates on costs and results; (o) th e o utcome of contingencies, including legal proceedings, government or regulatory investigations, and environmental remediation, which can expose Howmet Aerospace to substantial cost s a nd liabilities; and (p) the other risk factors summarized in Howmet Aerospace’s Form 10 - K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchan ge Commission (SEC). Market projections are subject to the risks discussed above and other risks in the market. The statements in this presentation are made as of the date of this pre sentation, even if subsequently made available by Howmet Aerospace on its website or otherwise.

Important Information 2  

Important Information (continued) 3 References herein to Howmet Aerospace refer to Arconic Inc., which will be renamed “Howmet Aerospace Inc.” upon its separation from Arconic Rolled Products Corporation (to be renamed “Arconic Corporation” upon the separation). Non - GAAP Financial Measures Some of the information included in this presentation is derived from Howmet Aerospace’s consolidated financial information b ut is not presented in Howmet Aerospace’s financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GA AP) . Certain of these data are considered “non - GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. These non - GAAP financial measures supplement our GAAP disclosures and should not be co nsidered an alternative to the GAAP measure. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and management’s rationale for the use of th e n on - GAAP financial measures can be found in the Appendix to this presentation. Howmet Aerospace has not provided reconciliations of any forward - looking non - GAAP financial m easures, such as organic revenue, earnings per share excluding special items, adjusted free cash flow, and free cash flow conversion, to the most directly comparable GA AP financial measures because such reconciliations are not available without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges and other compon ent s excluded from the non - GAAP measures, such as the effects of foreign currency movements, equity income, gains or losses on sales of assets, taxes, and any future restructu rin g or impairment charges. These reconciling items are in addition to the inherent variability already included in the GAAP measures, which includes, but is not limited to, price/m ix and volume. Howmet Aerospace believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. “Organic revenue” is GAAP revenue adjusted for Tennessee Packaging (which completed its phase - down as of year - end 2018), divesti tures, and changes in aluminum prices and foreign currency exchange rates relative to prior year period. “Adjusted free cash flow” is cash provided from (used for) ope rat ions, less capital expenditures, plus cash receipts from sold receivables. Any reference to historical EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA for which we have provided calculations and rec onciliations in the Appendix. Other Information In the third quarter of 2019, Howmet Aerospace realigned its operations by eliminating its Transportation and Construction So lut ions (TCS) segment and transferring the Forged Wheels business to the Engineered Products and Forgings (EP&F) segment (formerly named the Engineered Products and Solutions seg ment) and the Building and Construction Systems (BCS) business to the Global Rolled Products (GRP) segment. The Latin American extrusions business, formerly part of the TCS segment prior to its sale in April of 2018, was moved to Corporate. In the first quarter of 2019, Howmet Aerospace transferred its Aluminum Extrusions operations from th e E P&F segment to the GRP segment. Prior period financial information has been recast to conform to current year presentation.

On January 27, 2020, Arconic Inc. reported unaudited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2019 for its Engineered Products and Forgin gs (“EP&F”) segment. Our historical consolidated financial information was prepared from Arconic Inc’s historical accounting records, including the underlying financial data derived fr om the operations that comprise Arconic Inc’s EP&F segment. Certain financial information of Arconic Inc’s EP&F segment included in this presentation is the information of Arconic Inc’s EP&F se gme nt as a reportable segment of Arconic Inc. Our final audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 may differ from Arconic Inc’s EP&F segment’s un audited financial results included in this presentation, and the unaudited financial results for Arconic Inc’s EP&F segment for the year ended December 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicativ e o f our future results for any subsequent periods. Arconic Inc Engineered Products and Forgings Segment Organic revenue is a non - GAAP financial measure . Management believes this measure is meaningful to investors as it presents revenue on a comparable basis for all periods presented due to the impact of the sale of the forgings businesses in Eger, Hungary (divested in December 2018 ) and the United Kingdom (divested in December 2019 ), and the impact of changes in aluminum prices and foreign currency fluctuations relative to the prior year periods . The revenue from a small manufacturing facility that was divested in the second quarter of 2019 and the small energy business that was divested in the third quarter of 2019 was not material and therefore is included in Organic revenue .

Reconciliation of Arconic Inc Corporate Expense Excluding Special Items 47 Arconic Inc Corporate expense excluding Special items is a non - GAAP financial measure.

To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both Arconic Inc Corporate expense determined under GAAP as well as Arconic Inc Corporate exp ense excluding Special items.
