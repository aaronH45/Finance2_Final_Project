Wynn Resorts, Limited Reports Fourth Quarter and Year End 2019 Results

LAS VEGAS, February 6, 2020 — Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ: WYNN) (the "Company") today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2019. 

Operating revenues were $1.65 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of 2.0%, or $34.1 million, from $1.69 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018. Net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited was $72.9 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited of $464.9 million, or $4.31 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2018 (which included a net tax benefit of $390.9 million related to U.S. tax reform). 

"We delivered solid financial results in the fourth quarter of 2019, growing Adjusted Property EBITDA nearly 12% sequentially compared to the third quarter," said Matt Maddox, CEO of Wynn Resorts, Limited. "In Macau, the investments we have made position us well to compete in any market environment, supported by another quarter of record mass table win. Our strategy at Wynn Las Vegas is producing results, driving year-over-year volume growth in our domestic gaming business along with 3% growth in RevPAR. Encore Boston Harbor continues to ramp nearly doubling its Adjusted Property EBITDA sequentially and we remain excited by the opportunity to drive growth at the property over the next several years."

"It was also a successful quarter on the development front as we made significant progress rolling out the industry’s leading global growth pipeline. In November, we launched key portions of the new Lakeside Casino at Wynn Macau, further solidifying the property as the peninsula's marquee integrated resort. In Las Vegas, construction on our 430,000 square foot meeting and convention expansion is complete and we are gearing up to welcome our first groups to the new space. We are excited about the outlook for the Company and we will continue to focus on leveraging our premium-focused business model to drive long-term returns for shareholders."

Forward-looking Statements

This release contains forward-looking statements regarding operating trends and future results of operations. Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, extensive regulation of our business, pending or future legal proceedings, ability to maintain gaming licenses and concessions, dependence on key employees, general global political and economic conditions, adverse tourism trends, dependence on a limited number of resorts, competition in the casino/hotel and resort industries, uncertainties over the development, and success of new gaming and resort properties, construction risks, cybersecurity risk and our leverage and debt service. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the Company's other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update or revise its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

(1) "Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited" is net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited before litigation settlement expense, nonrecurring regulatory expense, pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, change in derivatives fair value, change in Redemption Note fair value, (loss) gain on extinguishment of debt, foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss), the impact from the enactment of U.S. tax reform, net of noncontrolling interests and income taxes calculated using the specific tax treatment applicable to the adjustments based on their respective jurisdictions. Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited and adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited per diluted share are presented as supplemental disclosures to financial measures in accordance with GAAP because management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. These measures are used by management and/or evaluated by some investors, in addition to net income (loss) and earnings per share computed in accordance with GAAP, as an additional basis for assessing period-to-period results of our business. Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited and adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited per diluted share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. 

3

(2) "Adjusted Property EBITDA" is net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, litigation settlement expense, pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other (including intercompany golf course and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, (loss) gain on extinguishment of debt, change in derivatives fair value, change in Redemption Note fair value and other non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted Property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. The Company also presents Adjusted Property EBITDA because it is used by some investors to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including Wynn Resorts, Limited, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted Property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company's performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income (loss), Adjusted Property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted Property EBITDA. Also, Wynn Resorts' calculation of Adjusted Property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

The Company has included schedules in the tables that accompany this release that reconcile (i) net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited, (ii) operating income to Adjusted Property EBITDA, and (iii) net income (loss) attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited to Adjusted Property EBITDA.
