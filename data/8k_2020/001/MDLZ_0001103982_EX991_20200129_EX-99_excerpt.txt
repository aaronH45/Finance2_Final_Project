Fourth Quarter Commentary

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

(Unaudited)  

The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). However, management believes that also presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of the company’s historical operating results and trends in its underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how the company evaluates its business. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the company’s performance. The company also believes that presenting these measures allows investors to view its performance using the same measures that the company uses in evaluating its financial and business performance and trends.  

The company considers quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of its ongoing financial and business performance and trends. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition & divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. See below for a description of adjustments to the company’s U.S. GAAP financial measures included herein.  

Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.  

Because GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis are not accessible and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort, the company has not provided that information with regard to the non-GAAP financial measures in the company’s outlook. Refer to the Outlook section below for more details.  

DEFINITIONS OF THE COMPANY’S NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The company’s non-GAAP financial measures and corresponding metrics reflect how the company evaluates its operating results currently and provide improved comparability of operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When these definitions change, the company provides the updated definitions and presents the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis. When items no longer impact the company’s current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, the company removes these items from its non-GAAP definitions. During the third quarter of 2019, the company added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of the impact from Swiss tax reform.  

   •    

“Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and currency rate fluctuations. The company also evaluates Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging and developed markets.  

   •    

“Adjusted Gross Profit” is defined as gross profit excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program; acquisition integration costs; the operating results of divestitures; mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts; and incremental expenses related to the 2017 malware incident. The company also presents “Adjusted Gross Profit margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Gross Profit. The company also evaluates growth in the company’s Adjusted Gross Profit on a constant currency basis.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   •    

“Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition, as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on equity method investment transactions; net earnings from divestitures; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans; and U.S. and Swiss tax reform impacts. Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, the company’s equity method investment net earnings exclude its proportionate share of its investees’ unusual or infrequent items.   

 The tax impact of each of the items excluded from the company’s GAAP results was computed based on the facts and tax assumptions associated with each item, and such impacts have also been excluded from Adjusted EPS. The company also evaluates growth in the company’s Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis.  

   •    

“Free Cash Flow” is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow is the company’s primary measure used to monitor its cash flow performance.  

See the attached schedules for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most comparable GAAP financial measures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019. See Items Impacting Comparability of Operating Results below for more information about the items referenced in these definitions.   

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME  

The company uses segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. The company believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangibles, gains and losses on divestitures and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. The company excludes these items from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of its segment operating results. Furthermore, the company centrally manages benefit plan non-service income and interest and other expense, net. Accordingly, the company does not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that management reviews.  

ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY OF OPERATING RESULTS  

The following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability of operating results. The company identifies these based on how management views the company’s business; makes financial, operating and planning decisions; and evaluates the company’s ongoing performance. In addition, the company discloses the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on the company’s financial results in order to reflect results on a constant currency basis.  

Divestitures, Divestiture-related costs and Gains/(losses) on Divestitures  

Divestitures include completed sales of businesses and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement.  

   •    

On May 28, 2019, the company completed the sale of most of its cheese business in the Middle East and Africa to Arla Foods of Denmark. The company recorded a pre-tax gain of $44 million on the sale and incurred divestiture-related costs of $6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.  

   •    

On April 28, 2017, the company completed the sale of several manufacturing facilities in France and the sale or license of several local confectionery brands. The company reversed accrued divestiture-related costs no longer required of $1 million during the three months ended and $4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.  

Acquisitions, Acquisition-related costs and Acquisition integration costs  

On July 16, 2019, the company acquired a majority interest in a U.S. refrigerated nutrition bar company, Perfect Snacks, within its North America segment. The acquisition added incremental net revenues of $27 million in the three months and $53 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. In connection with this transaction, the company incurred acquisition-related costs of $1 million in the three months and $3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.  

On June 7, 2018, the company acquired a U.S. premium biscuit company, Tate’s Bake Shop, within its North America segment and extended its premium biscuit offerings. Through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition, Tate’s added incremental net revenues of $35 million in 2019. In addition, the company reversed accrued acquisition-related costs of $1 million in the three months and incurred $13 million of acquisition-related costs in the year ended December 31, 2018.  

Within the company’s AMEA segment, in connection with the acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam in 2015, the company recorded integration costs of $4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.  

Simplify to Grow Program  

On September 6, 2018, the company’s Board of Directors approved an extension of the restructuring program through 2022, an increase of $1.3 billion in the program charges and an increase of $700 million in capital expenditures. The current restructuring program, as increased and extended by these actions, is now called the Simplify to Grow Program. The primary objective of the Simplify to Grow Program is to reduce the company’s operating cost structure in both its supply chain and overhead costs. The program covers severance as well as asset disposals and other manufacturing and procurement-related one-time costs.  

Restructuring costs  

The company recorded restructuring charges of $59 million in the three months and $176 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and $96 million in the three months and $316 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 within asset impairment and exit costs and benefit plan non-service income. These charges were for non-cash asset write-downs (including accelerated depreciation and asset impairments), severance and other related costs.   

Implementation costs  

Implementation costs primarily relate to reorganizing the company’s operations and facilities in connection with its supply chain reinvention program and other identified productivity and cost saving initiatives. The costs include incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities, costs to terminate certain contracts and the simplification of the company’s information systems. The company recorded implementation costs of $79 million in the three months and $272 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and $100 million in the three months and $315 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.  

Intangible asset impairment charges  

During the company’s 2019 annual testing of non-amortizable intangible assets, the company recorded $57 million of impairment charges in the third quarter of 2019 related to nine trademarks. The impairments arose due to lower than expected brand earnings growth. The company recorded charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy brands of $39 million in Europe, $15 million in AMEA and $3 million in Latin America. The impairment charges were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs.  

During the company’s 2018 annual testing of non-amortizable intangible assets, the company recorded $68 million of impairment charges in the third quarter of 2018 related to five trademarks. The impairments arose due to lower than expected brand earnings growth. The company recorded charges related to gum, chocolate, biscuits and candy trademarks of $45 million in Europe, $14 million in North America and $9 million in AMEA. The impairment charges were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs.  

Mark-to-market impacts from commodity and currency derivative contracts  

The company excludes unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives from its non-GAAP earnings measures until such time that the related exposures impact its operating results. The company recorded net unrealized gains on commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives of $23 million in the three months and $90 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and recorded net unrealized losses of $38 million in the three months and net unrealized gains of $142 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.  

Remeasurement of net monetary position  

During the second quarter of 2018, primarily based on published estimates which indicated that Argentina’s three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%, the company concluded that Argentina became a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. As of July 1, 2018, the company began to apply highly inflationary accounting for its Argentinian subsidiaries and changed their functional currency from the Argentinian peso to the U.S. dollar. On July 1, 2018, both monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Argentinian pesos were remeasured into U.S. dollars. As of each subsequent balance sheet date, Argentinian peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, with remeasurement and other transaction gains and losses recorded in net earnings. Within selling, general and administrative expenses, the company recorded a remeasurement gain of $6 million in the three months and $4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, and a remeasurement gain of $2 million in the three months and a remeasurement loss of $11 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, within selling, general and administrative expenses related to the valuation of the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets over these periods.  

Impact from pension participation changes  

The impact from pension participation changes represent the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. The company excludes these charges from its non-GAAP results because those amounts do not reflect the company’s ongoing pension obligations.  

During 2018, the company executed a complete withdrawal from the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund (“Fund”) and recorded a $429 million estimate of the withdrawal liability. On July 11, 2019, the company received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment from the Fund totaling $526 million and requiring pro-rata monthly payments over 20 years and it recorded a $35 million final adjustment as of June 30, 2019. The company began making monthly payments during the third quarter. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining discounted withdrawal liability was $391 million, with $14 million recorded in other current liabilities and $377 million recorded in long-term other liabilities.  

Impact from resolution of tax matters  

During the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with a tax amnesty program in India, the company resolved several indirect tax matters and recorded $85 million of net indirect tax expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses.  

During the fourth quarter of 2018, the company resolved an indirect tax matter in Brazil and recorded a net benefit of $26 million in selling, general and administrative expenses.   

A tax indemnification matter related to the company’s 2007 acquisition of the LU biscuit business was closed during the quarter ended June 30, 2018. The closure had no impact on net earnings; however, it did result in a $15 million tax benefit that was fully offset by an $11 million expense in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $4 million expense in interest and other expense, net.  

CEO transition remuneration  

On November 20, 2017, Dirk Van de Put succeeded Irene Rosenfeld as CEO of Mondelēz International. In order to incent Mr. Van de Put to join the company, the company provided him compensation to make him whole for incentive awards he forfeited or grants that were not made to him when he left his former employer. In connection with Irene Rosenfeld’s retirement, the company made her outstanding grants of performance share units for the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance cycles eligible for continued vesting and paid $0.5 million salary for her service as Chairman from January through March 2018. The company refers to these elements of Mr. Van de Put’s and Ms. Rosenfeld’s compensation arrangements together as “CEO transition remuneration.”  

The company is excluding amounts it expenses as CEO transition remuneration from its non-GAAP results because those amounts are not part of the company’s regular compensation program and are incremental to amounts the company would have incurred as ongoing CEO compensation. The company incurred CEO transition remuneration of $3 million in the three months and $12 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 and $4 million in the three months and $22 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.  

Gains/losses related to interest rate swaps  

Within interest and other expense, net, the company recognized a loss of $111 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, and gains of $10 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, related to certain forward-starting interest rate swaps for which the planned timing and currency of the related forecasted debt was changed.  

Loss on debt extinguishment  

On April 17, 2018, the company completed a cash tender offer and retired $570 million of long-term U.S. dollar debt. The company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $140 million within interest and other expense, net related to the amount the company paid to retire the debt in excess of its carrying value and from recognizing unamortized discounts, deferred financing and other cash costs in earnings at the time of the debt extinguishment.  

U.S. tax reform discrete impacts  

On December 22, 2017, new U.S. tax reform legislation was enacted that included a broad range of complex provisions impacting the taxation of businesses. In connection with implementing U.S. tax reform, the company recorded a discrete net tax expense of $5 million in 2019 and $19 million in 2018.  

Swiss tax reform impacts  

On August 6, 2019, Switzerland published changes to its Federal tax law in the Official Federal Collection of Laws. On September 27, 2019, the Zurich Canton published their decision on the September 1, 2019 Zurich Canton public vote regarding the Cantonal changes associated with the Swiss Federal tax law change. The intent of these tax law changes was to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as “Swiss tax reform.” Based on these Federal/Cantonal events, it is the company’s position that enactment of Swiss tax reform for U.S. GAAP purposes has been met as of September 30, 2019, and the company recorded the impacts in the third quarter 2019. The net impact is a benefit of $767 million, which consists of a $769 million reduction in deferred tax expense primarily from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes (recorded net of valuation allowance) and remeasurement of the company’s deferred tax balances, partially offset by a $2 million indirect tax impact in selling, general and administrative expenses. The future rate impacts of these Swiss tax reform law changes are effective starting January 1, 2020.  

Gains and losses on equity method investment transactions  

On July 9, 2018, Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (“Keurig”) closed on its definitive merger agreement with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., and formed Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NYSE: “KDP”), a publicly traded company. Following the close of the transaction, the company’s 24.2% investment in Keurig together with its shareholder loan receivable became a 13.8% investment in KDP. During the third quarter of 2018, the company recorded a preliminary pre-tax gain of $757 million reported as a gain on equity method transaction and $184 million of deferred tax expense reported in the provision for income taxes (or $573 million after-tax gain) related to the change in the company’s ownership interest while KDP finalized the valuation for the transaction. During the company’s fourth quarter of 2018, KDP finalized its opening balance sheet and the company increased its pre-tax gain by $21 million (or $13 million after-tax) to $778 million (or $586 million after-tax) while recording $8 million of deferred tax expense related to the increase for a total deferred tax expense of $192 million for 2018.   

As of December 31, 2019, the company held a 13.6% ownership interest in KDP valued at approximately $5.5 billion (based on KDP’s closing stock price), which exceeded the carrying value of the company’s KDP investment. The company’s KDP ownership interest could change over time due to stock-based compensation arrangements and other KDP transactions. During the first quarter of 2019, due to the impact of a KDP acquisition that decreased the company’s ownership from 13.8% to 13.6%, the company recognized a $23 million pre-tax gain.  

On March 7, 2016, the company exchanged a portion of its JDE equity interest for a new equity interest in Keurig. As a result of the exchange, the company recorded the difference between the $2 billion fair value of Keurig and the company’s basis in the exchanged JDE shares as a gain of $43 million. In the second quarter of 2019, the company determined that an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive losses related to its JDE investment was required, which reduced the company’s previously reported gain by $29 million. The company recorded the adjustment as a loss on equity method transactions.  

During the second quarter of 2019, the company also recorded an additional pre-tax gain of $4 million related to the 2018 sale of one of its equity method investments. This additional gain relates to the release of funds previously held in escrow.  

Equity method investee adjustments  

Within Adjusted EPS, the company’s equity method investment net earnings exclude its proportionate share of its investees’ unusual or infrequent items, such as acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring program costs and discrete U.S. tax reform impacts recorded by the company’s JDE and KDP equity method investees.  

Constant currency  

Management evaluates the operating performance of the company and its international subsidiaries on a constant currency basis. The company determines its constant currency operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the company’s financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.  

OUTLOOK  

The company’s outlook for 2020 Organic Net Revenue growth, Adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or otherwise adjust for items impacting comparability of financial results such as the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, restructuring activities, acquisitions and divestitures. The company is not able to reconcile its projected Organic Net Revenue growth to its projected reported net revenue growth for the full-year 2020 because the company is unable to predict during this period the impact from potential acquisitions or divestitures, as well as the impact of currency translation due to the unpredictability of future changes in currency exchange rates, which could be material as a significant portion of the company’s operations are outside the U.S. The company is not able to reconcile its projected Adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis to its projected reported diluted EPS growth for the full-year 2020 because the company is unable to predict during this period the timing of its restructuring program costs, mark-to-market impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts and impacts from potential acquisitions or divestitures well as the impact of currency translation due to the unpredictability of future changes in currency exchange rates, which could be material as a significant portion of the company’s operations are outside the U.S. The company is not able to reconcile its projected Free Cash Flow to its projected net cash from operating activities for the full-year 2020 because the company is unable to predict during this period the timing and amount of capital expenditures impacting cash flow. Therefore, because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of future adjustments, which could be significant, the company is unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures without unreasonable effort.
