Equity Residential Reports Full Year 2019 Results 

Provides Outlook for 2020 

Chicago, IL – January 28, 2020 - Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2019. All per share results are reported as available to common shares/units on a diluted basis.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

“Equity Residential had a very good 2019. Strong demand and record resident satisfaction and retention drove same store revenue growth to the high end of our original expectations. Also, Normalized FFO grew by a healthy 7.4%, which was above our expectations. Thanks to the entire Equity Residential team for all they did to accomplish this,” said Mark J. Parrell, Equity Residential’s President and CEO. “We expect a consistently growing economy in 2020 to create steady demand to absorb the continuing elevated levels of new supply that will be delivered in most of our markets. This, combined with the impact of the new rent control regulations in California and New York, leads us to anticipate same store revenue growth slightly below our 2019 result.” 

Company Highlights  

•  

Produced same store revenue growth of 3.2% for the fourth quarter of 2019, with Physical Occupancy of 96.1% and Renewal Rate Achieved growth of 4.8%. For the full year 2019, produced same store revenue growth of 3.2% with Physical Occupancy of 96.4% and Renewal Rate Achieved growth of 4.9%. 

•  

Produced Normalized FFO per share growth of 8.3% for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 7.4% for the full year 2019.

•  

Smart Home Technology: The installation of smart home technology in an additional 10,000 apartment units at a cost of approximately $1,000 per unit (included in the Company’s capital expenditures guidance on page 26). The Company expects to receive a rent premium of approximately $30 per month per apartment unit; 

•  

Sales-Focused Improvements: Full deployment of an AI-enabled sales tool, self-guided tours and a new mobile customer relationship management platform, resulting in efficiencies across the sales function; and 

•  

Service Enhancements: Full deployment of service mobility, creating efficiencies in the service function by driving improved service personnel utilization and enhanced outsourcing decision quality.

Table of Contents 

The Company expects the impact of these initiatives to deliver approximately $15 million in annual NOI improvements once fully deployed with approximately $5 million of that NOI benefit expected in 2020. These early stage initiatives provide a foundation upon which the Company will build in 2021 and beyond.  

Investment Activity 

The Company acquired three apartment properties during the fourth quarter of 2019, totaling 812 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $370.1 million at a weighted average Acquisition Capitalization Rate of 4.8%. Two of the properties are located in Seattle and the other in suburban Washington, D.C.  

The Company sold two properties during the fourth quarter of 2019, totaling 1,159 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of approximately $374.0 million at a weighted average Disposition Yield of 4.8%, generating an Unlevered IRR of 7.6%. The properties are located in suburban Washington, D.C.  

During 2019, the Company acquired 13 properties, totaling 3,540 apartment units, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.49 billion at a weighted average Acquisition Capitalization Rate of 4.7%. 

During 2019, the Company sold 11 wholly-owned properties, totaling 2,361 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of approximately $1.08 billion at a weighted average Disposition Yield of 4.6%, generating an Unlevered IRR of 7.8%. During 2019, the Company also sold two unconsolidated properties, totaling 945 apartment units, for an aggregate sale price of approximately $394.5 million at a weighted average Disposition Yield of 4.7%, received net proceeds of approximately $78.3 million and recognized a GAAP gain on sale of approximately $69.5 million from these sales. 

Capital Markets Activity   

On November 1, 2019, the Company’s operating partnership entered into a $2.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility, replacing its existing $2.0 billion credit agreement. The new facility matures on November 1, 2024, and can be extended or increased, subject to lender consent and customary conditions. The interest rate and facility fees are based on the operating partnership’s long-term unsecured credit ratings. 

In addition, the operating partnership increased the maximum size for its unsecured commercial paper note program from $500.0 million to $1.0 billion. The notes will be sold under customary terms in the United States commercial paper note market and will rank pari passu with all of the other unsecured senior indebtedness of the operating partnership. 

On December 6, 2019, the Company redeemed $600.0 million in 4.75% unsecured notes originally due to mature on July 15, 2020. In conjunction with the redemption, the Company incurred approximately $11.6 million in debt extinguishment costs, of which $10.3 million represented cash prepayment penalties and $1.3 million represented non-cash write-offs of unamortized debt discounts and deferred financing costs, all of which are not included in Normalized FFO. The Company's strong liquidity profile as a result of the credit facility and commercial paper program activity discussed above allowed for this early redemption. 

2020 Common Share Dividend 

The Company expects to declare a common share dividend of $0.6025 per share for the first quarter of 2020, which is an annualized increase of approximately 6.2% over the 2019 dividend. This increase is driven by the Company’s continued strong cash flow performance, solid balance sheet and modest payout ratio. The first quarter dividend and all future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the Company’s Board of Trustees.

Both quarter over quarter and year over year changes (unless otherwise noted) are due primarily to:  

Real estate taxes – Increase above expectations due primarily to fewer recoveries from appeals activity. 

On-site payroll – Year over year increase below expectations. Payroll pressures continue but were offset by lower than expected employee benefit- related costs. 

Utilities – Quarter over quarter growth slightly higher than expected but generally in line with expectations for the year. 

Insurance – Increase due to higher premiums on property insurance renewal as a result of challenging conditions in the insurance market. 

Other on-site operating expenses – Increase primarily driven by higher ground lease costs due to a contractual revaluation at one property along with higher association fees.

Additional Reconciliations and Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms 

(Amounts in thousands except per share and per apartment unit data) 

(All per share data is diluted) 

This Earnings Release and Supplemental Financial Information includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and other terms that management believes are helpful in understanding our business. The definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP financial measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other real estate investment trusts (“REIT”) and, accordingly, may not be comparable. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or any other measurement of performance computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) or as an alternative to cash flows from specific operating, investing or financing activities. Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be a measure of cash flow or liquidity. 

Acquisition Capitalization Rate or Cap Rate – NOI that the Company anticipates receiving in the next 12 months (or the year two or three stabilized NOI for properties that are in lease-up at acquisition) less an estimate of property management costs/management fees allocated to the project (generally ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% of revenues depending on the size and income streams of the asset) and less an estimate for in-the-unit replacement capital expenditures (generally ranging from $100-$450 per apartment unit depending on the age and condition of the asset) divided by the gross purchase price of the asset. The weighted average Acquisition Cap Rate for acquired properties is weighted based on the projected NOI streams and the relative purchase price for each respective property. 

Average Rental Rate – Total residential rental revenues reflected on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP divided by the weighted average occupied apartment units for the reporting period presented. 

Capital Expenditures to Real Estate: 

Building Improvements – Includes roof replacement, paving, building mechanical equipment systems, exterior siding and painting, major landscaping, furniture, fixtures and equipment for amenities and common areas, vehicles and office and maintenance equipment. 

Renovation Expenditures – Apartment unit renovation costs (primarily kitchens and baths) designed to reposition these units for higher rental levels in their respective markets. 

Replacements – Includes appliances, mechanical equipment, fixtures and flooring (including hardwood and carpeting). 

Debt Balances:  

Commercial Paper Program – The Company may borrow up to a maximum of $1.0 billion under its commercial paper program subject to market conditions. The notes bear interest at various floating rates.  

Revolving Credit Facility – The Company’s $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility matures November 1, 2024. The interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be LIBOR plus a spread (currently 0.775%), or based on bids received from the lending group, and an annual facility fee (currently 0.125%). Both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the Company’s senior unsecured credit rating. In addition, the Company limits its utilization of the facility in order to maintain liquidity to support its $1.0 billion commercial paper program along with certain other obligations. The following table presents the availability on the Company’s unsecured revolving credit facility: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Debt Covenant Compliance – Our unsecured debt includes certain financial and operating covenants including, among other things, maintenance of certain financial ratios. These provisions are contained in the indentures applicable to each notes payable or the credit agreement for our line of credit. The Debt Covenant Compliance ratios that are provided show the Company's compliance with certain covenants governing our public unsecured debt. These covenants generally reflect our most restrictive financial covenants. The Company was in compliance with its unsecured debt covenants for all periods presented.

(All per share data is diluted) 

Development Yield – NOI that the Company anticipates receiving in the next 12 months following stabilization less an estimate of property management costs/management fees allocated to the project (generally ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% of revenues depending on the size and income streams of the asset) and less an estimate for in-the-unit replacement capital expenditures (generally ranging from $50-$150 per apartment unit depending on the type of asset) divided by the Total Budgeted Capital Cost of the asset. The weighted average Development Yield for development properties is weighted based on the projected NOI streams and the relative Total Budgeted Capital Cost for each respective property. 

Disposition Yield – NOI that the Company anticipates giving up in the next 12 months less an estimate of property management costs/management fees allocated to the project (generally ranging from 2.0% to 4.0% of revenues depending on the size and income streams of the asset) and less an estimate for in-the-unit replacement capital expenditures (generally ranging from $100-$450 per apartment unit depending on the age and condition of the asset) divided by the gross sales price of the asset. The weighted average Disposition Yield for sold properties is weighted based on the projected NOI streams and the relative sales price for each respective property. 

Earnings Per Share ("EPS") – Net income per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Expected EPS is calculated on a basis consistent with actual EPS. Due to the uncertain timing and extent of property dispositions and the resulting gains/losses on sales, actual EPS could differ materially from expected EPS. 

EBITDA for Real Estate and Normalized EBITDA for Real Estate: 

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (“EBITDAre”) – The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) defines EBITDAre (September 2017 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and further adjusted for gains and losses from sales of depreciated operating properties, impairment write-downs of depreciated operating properties, impairment write-downs of investments in unconsolidated entities caused by a decrease in value of depreciated operating properties within the joint venture and adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of EBITDAre of investments in unconsolidated entities. 

The Company believes that EBITDAre is useful to investors, creditors and rating agencies as a supplemental measure of the Company’s ability to incur and service debt because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry, and by excluding gains or losses related to sales or impairment of depreciated operating properties, EBITDAre can help compare the Company’s credit strength between periods or as compared to different companies. 

Normalized Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (“Normalized EBITDAre”) – Represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and further adjusted for non-comparable items. Normalized EBITDAre, total debt to Normalized EBITDAre and net debt to Normalized EBITDAre are important metrics in evaluating the credit strength of the Company and its ability to service its debt obligations. The Company believes that Normalized EBITDAre, total debt to Normalized EBITDAre, and net debt to Normalized EBITDAre are useful to investors, creditors and rating agencies because they allow investors to compare the Company’s credit strength to prior reporting periods and to other companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company’s actual credit quality. 

Economic Gain (Loss) – Economic Gain (Loss) is calculated as the net gain (loss) on sales of real estate properties in accordance with GAAP, excluding accumulated depreciation. The Company generally considers Economic Gain (Loss) to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net gain (loss) on sales of real estate properties in accordance with GAAP because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Company's acquisition, development, renovation, management and ultimate sale of a property and because it helps investors to understand the relationship between the cash proceeds from a sale and the cash invested in the sold property. The following table presents a reconciliation of net gain (loss) on sales of real estate properties in accordance with GAAP to Economic Gain (Loss):

FFO and Normalized FFO: 

Funds From Operations (“FFO”) – Nareit defines FFO (December 2018 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate and land when connected to the main business of a REIT, impairment write-downs of investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and depreciation and amortization related to real estate. Adjustments for partially owned consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Expected FFO per share is calculated on a basis consistent with actual FFO per share and is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of expected operating performance when compared to expected EPS.  

The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate and excluding depreciation related to real estate (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units can help compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. 

Normalized Funds From Operations ("Normalized FFO") – Normalized FFO begins with FFO and excludes: 

•  

the impact of any expenses relating to non-operating asset impairment; 

•  

pursuit cost write-offs; 

•  

gains and losses from early debt extinguishment and preferred share redemptions; 

•  

gains and losses from non-operating assets; and 

•  

other miscellaneous items. 

Expected Normalized FFO per share is calculated on a basis consistent with actual Normalized FFO per share and is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of expected operating performance when compared to expected EPS. 

The Company believes that Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the Company's operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company's actual operating results. 

FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company's calculation of FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. 

FFO available to Common Shares and Units and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units are calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with GAAP. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the "Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership". Subject to certain restrictions, the Noncontrolling Interests – Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.  

The following table presents reconciliations of EPS to FFO per share and Normalized FFO per share for Consolidated Statements of Funds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations and Normalized FFO Guidance and Assumptions. The expected guidance/projections provided below are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.

Lease-Up NOI – Represents NOI for development properties: (i) in various stages of lease-up; and (ii) where lease-up has been completed but the properties were not stabilized (defined as having achieved 90% occupancy for three consecutive months) for all of the current and comparable periods presented. 

Net Operating Income (“NOI”) – NOI is the Company’s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment properties. NOI is defined as rental income less direct property operating expenses (including real estate taxes and insurance). The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's apartment properties. NOI does not include an allocation of property management expenses either in the current or comparable periods. Rental income for all leases and operating expense for ground leases (for both same store and non-same store properties) are reflected on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP for the current and comparable periods. 

The following tables present reconciliations of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations to NOI, along with rental income, operating expenses and NOI per the consolidated statements of operations allocated between same store and non-same store/other results (see Same Store Results):

New Lease Change – The change in rent for a lease with a new or transferring resident compared to the rent for the prior lease of the identical apartment unit, regardless of lease term and without concessions or discounts being applied. 

Non-Same Store Properties – For annual comparisons, primarily includes all properties acquired during 2018 and 2019, plus any properties in lease-up and not stabilized as of January 1, 2018. 

Physical Occupancy – The weighted average occupied apartment units for the reporting period divided by the average of total apartment units available for rent for the reporting period. 

Renewal Rate Achieved – The change in rent for a new lease on an apartment unit where the lease has been renewed as compared to the rent for the prior lease of the identical apartment unit, regardless of lease term. 

Same Store Operating Expenses: 

On-site Payroll – Includes payroll and related expenses for on-site personnel including property managers, leasing consultants, and maintenance staff. 

Other On-site Operating Expenses – Includes ground lease costs and administrative costs such as office supplies, telephone and data charges and association and business licensing fees. 

Repairs and Maintenance – Includes general maintenance costs, apartment unit turnover costs including interior painting, routine landscaping, security, exterminating, fire protection, snow removal, elevator, roof and parking lot repairs and other miscellaneous building repair and maintenance costs. 

Utilities – Represents gross expenses prior to any recoveries under the Resident Utility Billing System (“RUBS”). Recoveries are reflected in rental income. 

Same Store Properties – For annual comparisons, primarily includes all properties acquired or completed that are stabilized prior to January 1, 2018, less properties subsequently sold. Properties are included in Same Store when they are stabilized for all of the current and comparable periods presented. 

% of Stabilized Budgeted NOI – Represents budgeted 2020 NOI for stabilized properties and projected annual NOI at stabilization (defined as having achieved 90% occupancy for three consecutive months) for properties that are in lease-up. 

Total Budgeted Capital Cost – Estimated remaining cost for projects under development and/or developed plus all capitalized costs incurred to date, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, capitalized real estate taxes and insurance, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, plus any estimates of costs remaining to be funded for all projects, all in accordance with GAAP. 

Total Market Capitalization – The aggregate of the market value of the Company’s outstanding common shares, including restricted shares, the market value of the Company’s operating partnership units outstanding, including restricted units (based on the market value of the Company’s common shares) and the outstanding principal balance of debt. The Company believes this is a useful measure of a real estate operating company’s long-term liquidity and balance sheet strength, because it shows an approximate relationship between a company’s total debt and the current total market value of its assets based on the current price at which the Company’s common shares trade. However, because this measure of leverage changes with fluctuations in the Company’s share price, which occur regularly, this measure may change even when the Company’s earnings, interest and debt levels remain stable. 

Transaction Accretion (Dilution) – Represents the spread between the Acquisition Cap Rate and the Disposition Yield.  

Turnover – Total residential move-outs (including inter-property and intra-property transfers) divided by total residential apartment units. 

Unencumbered NOI % – Represents NOI generated by consolidated real estate assets unencumbered by outstanding secured debt as a percentage of total NOI generated by all of the Company's consolidated real estate assets. 

Unlevered Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) – The Unlevered IRR on sold properties is the compound annual rate of return calculated by the Company based on the timing and amount of: (i) the gross purchase price of the property plus any direct acquisition costs incurred by the Company; (ii) total revenues earned during the Company’s ownership period; (iii) total direct property operating expenses (including real estate taxes and insurance) incurred during the Company’s ownership period; (iv) capital expenditures incurred during the Company’s ownership period; and (v) the gross sales price of the property net of selling costs.

The calculation of the Unlevered IRR does not include an adjustment for the Company’s property management expense, general and administrative expense or interest expense (including loan assumption costs and other loan-related costs). Therefore, the Unlevered IRR is not a substitute for net income as a measure of our performance. Management believes that the Unlevered IRR achieved during the period a property is owned by the Company is useful because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Company’s acquisition, development, renovation, management and ultimate sale of a property, before the impact of Company overhead. The Unlevered IRR achieved on the properties as cited in this release should not be viewed as an indication of the gross value created with respect to other properties owned by the Company, and the Company does not represent that it will achieve similar Unlevered IRRs upon the disposition of other properties. The weighted average Unlevered IRR for sold properties is weighted based on all cash flows over the investment period for each respective property, including net sales proceeds. 

Weighted Average Coupons – Contractual interest rate for each debt instrument weighted by principal balances as of December 31, 2019. In case of debt for which fair value hedges are in place, the rate payable under the corresponding derivatives is used in lieu of the contractual interest rate. 

Weighted Average Rates – Interest expense for each debt instrument for the year ended December 31, 2019 weighted by its average principal balance for the same period. Interest expense includes amortization of premiums, discounts and other comprehensive income on debt and related derivative instruments. In case of debt for which derivatives are in place, the income or expense recognized under the corresponding derivatives is included in the total interest expense for the period.
