Duke Energy reports fourth quarter and full-year 2019 financial results [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

▪Achieved strong results above the midpoint of original and revised 2019 guidance range

▪Established 2020 adjusted EPS target of $5.25 and guidance range of $5.05 to $5.45

▪Extending long-term earnings growth expectation of 4% to 6% through 2024

CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) today announced 2019 full-year reported earnings per share (EPS), prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), and adjusted EPS of $5.06. This is compared to reported and adjusted EPS of $3.76 and $4.72, respectively, for the full-year 2018.

Adjusted EPS excludes the impact of certain items that are included in reported EPS. The impacts of items excluded from adjusted EPS were offsetting and results in no difference between 2019 GAAP reported EPS and adjusted EPS. 

Higher full-year 2019 adjusted results were primarily driven by growth from investments in all operating segments resulting in favorable pricing and riders and rate case impacts. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization and financing costs as Duke Energy's investment base grows.

“2019 was an outstanding year for Duke Energy, as we delivered on our commitments, advanced our long-term strategy and exceeded growth expectations,” said Lynn Good, Duke Energy chairman, president and CEO. “Our electric, gas and commercial renewables businesses are positioned to generate more value for customers and shareholders as we invest in low-risk opportunities across our thriving service areas.

Results like these give us confidence in our new 2020 adjusted EPS target of $5.25 and guidance range of $5.05 to $5.45. We also extended our 4% to 6% growth rate through 2024 and are expanding our five-year capital plan by $6 billion to meet the increasing energy needs in our jurisdictions. This plan builds upon the momentum we’ve generated and enables us to continue delivering long-term growth.”

Duke Energy News Release 2

Quarterly results

Duke Energy's fourth quarter 2019 GAAP reported EPS was $0.88, compared to $0.65 for fourth quarter 2018. Duke Energy's fourth quarter 2019 adjusted EPS was $0.91, compared to $0.84 for the fourth quarter of 2018. Higher adjusted results for the quarter compared to last year were driven by growth from investments at electric and gas utilities and new renewable projects placed in service. These items were partially offset by higher planned O&M expenses, depreciation and amortization and financing costs.

In addition to the following summary of fourth quarter 2019 business segment performance, comprehensive tables with detailed EPS drivers for the fourth quarter and full-year 2019 compared to prior year are provided at the end of this news release.

The discussion below of fourth quarter results includes both GAAP segment income and adjusted segment income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The tables at the end of this news release present a full reconciliation of GAAP reported results to adjusted results. 

Electric Utilities and Infrastructure

On a reported basis, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter 2019 segment income of $592 million, compared to $566 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Fourth quarter 2019 reported results included the reduction of an impairment charge originally recorded in 2018. This amount was treated as a special item and excluded from adjusted earnings.

On an adjusted basis, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter 2019 adjusted segment income of $584 million, compared to $628 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a decrease of $0.06 per share, excluding share dilution of $0.01. Lower quarterly results were primarily due to higher planned O&M expenses (-$0.11 per share) and higher depreciation and amortization on a growing asset base (-$0.05 per share). These results were partially offset by contributions from base rate changes and higher rider revenues (+$0.13 per share).

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure

On a reported basis, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter 2019 segment income of $140 million, compared to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition to the drivers outlined below, fourth quarter 2019 results were impacted by a $19 million after-tax impairment charge for Constitution, which was treated as a special item and excluded from adjusted earnings.

On an adjusted basis, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure recognized fourth quarter 2019 segment income of $159 million, compared to $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. This represents an increase of $0.06 per share. Higher quarterly results were driven primarily by contributions in the gas distribution business from base rate changes and higher pricing and riders.

Commercial Renewables

On a reported and adjusted basis, Commercial Renewables recognized fourth quarter 2019 segment income of $59 million, compared to a reported and adjusted segment income of $13 

Duke Energy News Release 3

million in the fourth quarter of 2018. This represents an increase of $0.06 per share. Higher quarterly results were primarily impacted by growth from new projects placed in service.

Other

Other primarily includes interest expense on holding company debt, other unallocated corporate costs and results from Duke Energy’s captive insurance company.

On a reported and adjusted basis, Other recognized a fourth quarter 2019 net loss of $124 million. This is compared to a reported and adjusted net loss of $248 million and $149 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2018. Fourth quarter 2018 results were impacted by severance charges and the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the Tax Act. These amounts were treated as special items and excluded from adjusted earnings. 

Improved quarterly results at Other were primarily due to higher returns on investments, lower claims at the captive insurer, partially offset by higher contributions to the Duke Energy Foundation and financing costs.

Effective tax rate

Duke Energy's consolidated reported effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 13.4% compared to (0.2)% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the Tax Act recorded in the fourth quarter 2018, which was treated as a special item and excluded from adjusted results.

The effective tax rate including impacts of noncontrolling interests and preferred dividends and excluding special items for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 12.6% compared to 16.1% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the amortization of excess deferred taxes.

The tables at the end of this news release present a reconciliation of the reported effective tax rate to the effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests and preferred dividends and excluding special items.

Duke Energy News Release 5

Non-GAAP financial measures

Management evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and effective tax rate including impacts of noncontrolling interests and preferred dividends and excluding special items. Adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS represent income from continuing operations available to Duke Energy common stockholders in dollar and per share amounts, adjusted for the dollar and per-share impact of special items. The effective tax rate including impacts of noncontrolling interests and preferred dividends and excluding special items is calculated using pretax earnings and income tax expense, both as adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests, preferred dividends and special items. As discussed below, special items include certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy's ongoing performance. 

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Board of Directors, employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and effective tax rate including impacts of noncontrolling interests and preferred dividends and excluding special items are Net Income Available to Duke Energy common stockholders (GAAP reported earnings), Diluted EPS Available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP reported EPS), and the reported effective tax rate, respectively. 

Special items included in the periods presented include the following items, which management believes do not reflect ongoing benefits or costs:

•Impairment Charges in 2019 represents a reduction of a prior year impairment at Citrus County CC and an other-than-temporary impairment of the remaining investment in Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC. For 2018, it represents an impairment at Citrus County CC, a goodwill impairment at Commercial Renewables and an other-than-temporary impairment of the investment in Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC. 

•Costs to Achieve Mergers represents charges that result from strategic acquisitions.

•Regulatory and Legislative Impacts in 2018 represents charges related to the Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas North Carolina rate case orders and the repeal of the South Carolina Base Load Review Act.

•Sale of Retired Plant represents the loss associated with selling Beckjord, a nonregulated generating facility in Ohio.

•Impacts of the Tax Act represents amounts recognized related to the Tax Act.

•Severance Charges relate to companywide initiatives, excluding merger integration, to standardize processes and systems, leverage technology and workforce optimization.

For the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, Basic EPS Available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders and Diluted EPS Available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders were equal. Beginning in 2020, Duke Energy will use adjusted basic EPS as the financial measure to evaluate management performance. Adjusted basic EPS will represent Basic EPS Available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP 

Duke Energy News Release 6

reported Basic EPS), adjusted for the per share impact of special items. Due to the forward-looking nature of any forecasted adjusted earnings guidance, information to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as management is unable to project all special items for future periods (such as legal settlements, the impact of regulatory orders or asset impairments).

Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income and other net loss. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends. Segment income includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Management also uses adjusted segment income as a measure of historical and anticipated future segment performance. Adjusted segment income is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it is based upon segment income adjusted for special items, which are discussed above. Management believes the presentation of adjusted segment income provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of a segment’s performance across periods. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted segment income or adjusted other net loss is segment income and other net loss.

Due to the forward-looking nature of any forecasted adjusted segment income or adjusted other net loss and any related growth rates for future periods, information to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not available at this time, as the company is unable to forecast all special items, as discussed above. 

Duke Energy’s adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted segment income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner.
