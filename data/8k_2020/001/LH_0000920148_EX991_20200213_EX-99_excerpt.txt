Consolidated Results

Fourth Quarter Results

Revenue for the quarter was $2.95 billion, an increase of 6.0% over $2.79 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in revenue was due to acquisitions of 4.5% and organic growth of 2.3% (which includes the negative impact from lower Medicare and Medicaid pricing as a result of PAMA of 0.9%), partially offset by the disposition of businesses of 0.6% and negative foreign currency translation of 0.2%.

Operating income for the quarter was $336.4 million, or 11.4% of revenue, compared to $307.7 million, or 11.0%, in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to acquisitions, organic growth, and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by the negative impact from PAMA and higher personnel costs. The Company recorded restructuring charges, special items, and amortization, which together totaled $85.6 million in the quarter, compared to $87.2 million during the same period in 2018. Adjusted operating income (excluding amortization, restructuring charges, and special items) for the quarter was $422.0 million, or 14.3% of revenue, compared to $394.9 million, or 14.2%, in the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding the negative impact from PAMA, adjusted operating income and margin grew $53.3 million and 90 basis points, respectively, over last year.

Net earnings for the quarter were $227.1 million, compared to $157.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Diluted EPS were $2.32 in the quarter, an increase of 48.7% compared to $1.56 in the same period in 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded $19.0 million in net gains on venture fund investments, partially offset by losses of $1.4 million on the disposition of businesses and a cost of $3.1 million related to debt refinancing. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $24.6 million loss on the disposition of its U.S. forensics laboratory testing business, a non-cash pension settlement charge of $7.5 million, and a loss of $5.2 million on a venture fund investment. Adjusted EPS (excluding amortization, restructuring charges, and special items) were $2.86 in the quarter, an increase of 13.5% over $2.52 in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Operating cash flow for the quarter was $569.8 million, compared to $486.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, which was negatively impacted by approximately $105 million from the net tax payment in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to the disposition of businesses. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher cash earnings, partially offset by increased working capital to support growth. Capital expenditures totaled $128.2 million, compared to $122.2 million a year ago. As a result, free cash flow

(operating cash flow less capital expenditures) was $441.6 million, compared to $364.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. 

At the end of the quarter, the Company’s cash balance and total debt were $337.5 million and $6.2 billion, respectively. During the quarter, the Company invested $23.1 million in acquisitions, repurchased $50.0 million of stock, representing approximately 0.3 million shares, and paid down $402.7 million of debt. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $900.0 million of authorization remaining under its share repurchase program.

Full Year Results

Revenue was $11.55 billion, an increase of 2.0% over last year's $11.33 billion. The increase in revenue was due to growth from acquisitions of 2.3% and organic growth of 1.6% (which includes the negative impact from PAMA of 0.9%), partially offset by the disposition of businesses of 1.4% and negative foreign currency translation of 0.5%.

Operating income was $1,330.2 million, or 11.5% of revenue, compared to $1,325.7 million, or 11.7%, in 2018. The Company recorded restructuring charges, special items, and amortization which together totaled $380.6 million, compared to $397.6 million during the same period in 2018. Adjusted operating income (excluding amortization, restructuring charges, and special items) was $1,710.8 million, or 14.8% of revenue, compared to $1,723.3 million, or 15.2%, in 2018. The decrease in operating income and margin was primarily due to the negative impact from PAMA, higher personnel costs, disposition of businesses, cybersecurity investments, and a favorable one-time legal settlement in 2018, partially offset by organic growth, the Company’s LaunchPad initiatives, and acquisitions. Excluding the negative impact from PAMA, adjusted operating income and margins grew $94.5 million and 40 basis points, respectively, over last year.

Net earnings in 2019 were $823.8 million, or $8.35 per diluted share, compared to $883.7 million, or $8.61 per diluted share, last year. During 2019, the Company recorded net gains of $20.9 million on venture fund investments, partially offset by losses of $13.3 million on the disposition of businesses and a cost of $3.1 million related to debt refinancing. During 2018, the Company recorded a net gain of $184.8 million on the disposition of businesses, partially offset by a charge of $45.0 million due to the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), a non-cash pension settlement charge of $7.5 million, and a $5.2 million loss on a venture fund investment.

Adjusted EPS (excluding amortization, restructuring, and special items) were $11.32, an increase of 2.7% compared to $11.02 in 2018.

Operating cash flow was $1,444.7 million, compared to $1,305.4 million in 2018, which was negatively impacted by approximately $105 million from the net tax payment in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to the disposition of businesses. The increase in operating cash flow was due to higher cash earnings, partially offset by increased working capital to support growth. Capital expenditures totaled $400.2 million, compared to $379.8 million in 2018. As a result, free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) was $1,044.5 million, compared to $925.6 million in 2018.

During the year, the Company invested $876.0 million in acquisitions and repurchased $450.0 million of stock representing approximately 2.9 million shares.

The following segment results exclude amortization, restructuring charges, special items, and unallocated corporate expenses. 

Fourth Quarter Segment Results

LabCorp Diagnostics

Revenue for the quarter was $1.76 billion, an increase of 3.7% over $1.69 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. The 3.7% increase in revenue was due to acquisitions of 3.5% and organic growth of 0.8%, partially offset by the negative impact from the disposition of businesses of 0.5%. The organic revenue increase of 0.8% includes the negative impact from PAMA of 1.5%.

Total volume (measured by requisitions), excluding the disposition of businesses, increased by 2.6%, as acquisition volume contributed 1.8% and organic volume increased by 0.8%. Organic volume includes the negative impact from managed care contract changes and lower consumer genetics demand, which largely offset the benefit of one additional revenue day. Excluding the disposition of businesses, revenue per requisition increased by 1.6% due to acquisitions and favorable mix, partially offset by the negative impact from PAMA and the nonrenewal of the BeaconLBS - UnitedHealthcare contract pertaining to the Florida market.

Adjusted operating income (excluding amortization, restructuring charges, and special items) for the quarter was $277.1 million, or 15.8% of revenue, compared to $279.3 million, or 16.5%, in the fourth quarter of 2018. The $2.2 million decline in adjusted operating income and 70 basis point decline in adjusted operating margin were primarily due to the negative impact from PAMA of $26.2 million and 130 basis points, higher personnel costs, and cybersecurity investments, partially offset by LaunchPad savings, organic growth, and acquisitions. The Company remains on track to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings from its three-year Diagnostics LaunchPad initiative by the end of 2021.

Covance Drug Development

Revenue for the quarter was $1.20 billion, an increase of 9.3% over $1.10 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in revenue was due to acquisitions of 6.0% and organic growth of 4.6%, partially offset by the disposition of the Covance Research Products business of 0.9% and negative foreign currency translation of 0.4%. Excluding pass-throughs, organic revenue grew mid-to-high single digits.

Adjusted operating income (excluding amortization, restructuring charges, and special items) for the quarter was $183.2 million, or 15.2% of revenue, compared to $153.5 million, or 14.0%, in the fourth quarter of 2018. The $29.7 million increase in adjusted operating income and 130 basis point increase in adjusted operating

margin were primarily due to LaunchPad savings, acquisitions, and organic growth, partially offset by higher personnel costs. The Company remains on track to deliver approximately $150 million of net savings from its three-year Drug Development LaunchPad initiative by the end of 2020.

Net orders and net book-to-bill during the trailing twelve months were $5.91 billion and 1.29, respectively.

However, the Company notes that these adjusted measures may be different from and not directly comparable to the measures presented by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures and an identification of the components that comprise "special items" used for certain adjusted financial information are included in the tables accompanying this press release.
