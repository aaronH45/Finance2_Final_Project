11.8 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury. 

(a) This Agreement and all claims, actions, proceedings or counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any of the Transactions, or the actions of the parties in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof and thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Michigan (without giving effect to choice of law principles thereof). 

(b) Each of the parties (i) irrevocably consents to submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of Michigan (such courts, collectively, the “Michigan Courts”) in the event any dispute, claim or cause of action arises out of or relates to this Agreement or the Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any Michigan Court, and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any claim or action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any court other than a Michigan Court. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 11.7. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable law. 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER, INCLUDING ANY CONTROVERSY INVOLVING ANY REPRESENTATIVE OF PARENT OR ANY HOLDER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.8(c).

11.9 Specific Enforcement. The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement. It is agreed that the parties are entitled to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages (and each such party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to applicable law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. 

11.10 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section or an Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section or an Exhibit of or to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in any Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning assigned to such term in this Agreement. Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” The words “hereof,” “hereto,” “hereby,” “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The term “or” is not exclusive. The word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply “if.” The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. All pronouns and any variations thereof refer to the masculine, feminine or neuter as the context may require. Any agreement, instrument or applicable law defined or referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or applicable law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise specifically indicated. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to “dollars” and “$” will be deemed references to the lawful money of the United States of America. 

11.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, including by facsimile or by email with .pdf attachments, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. 

11.12 Certain Definitions. When used in this Agreement, the following terms in all of their tenses, cases and correlative forms shall have the meanings assigned to them in this Section 11.12.

(c) “Family Trust” means, with respect to an individual, a trust for the benefit of such individual or for the benefit of any member or members of such individual’s Immediate Family or for the benefit of such individual and any member or members of such individual’s Immediate Family (for the purpose of determining whether or not a trust is a Family Trust, the fact that one (1) or more of the beneficiaries (but not the sole beneficiary) of the trust includes a Person or Persons, other than a member of such individual’s Immediate Family, entitled to a distribution after the death of the settlor if he, she, it, or they shall have survived the settlor of such trust, which distribution may be made of something other than Subject Interests and/or includes an organization or organizations exempt from federal income taxes pursuant to the provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code and described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code, shall be disregarded); provided, however, that in respect of transfers by way of testamentary or inter vivos trust, the trustee or trustees shall be solely such individual, a member or members of such individual’s Immediate Family, a responsible financial institution, an attorney that is a member of the Bar of any State in the United States, and/or an individual or individuals approved by the Parent.
