The aggregate principal amount of the Notes is $2.25 billion, and the net proceeds from the offering are approximately $2.29 billion, before expenses but after deducting the underwriting discount.

The offering of the Notes sold pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement was registered under Intel’s registration statement on Form S-3 filed on April 26, 2018 (File No. 333-224472) and the Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture between Intel and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as successor trustee (the “Trustee”), dated as of March 29, 2006 (the “Base Indenture”), as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture between Intel and the Trustee, dated as of December 3, 2007 (the “First Supplemental Indenture”), as further supplemented by the fourteenth supplemental indenture between Intel and the Trustee, dated as of February 13, 2020 with respect to the 2029 Notes and the 2049 Notes (the “Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture”) and the fifteenth supplemental indenture between Intel and the Trustee, dated as of February 13, 2020 with respect to the 2060 Notes (the “Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture”).
