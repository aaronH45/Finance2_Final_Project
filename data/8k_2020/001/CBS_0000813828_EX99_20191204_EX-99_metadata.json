        "The adjustment to “Benefit (provision) for income taxes” for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 reflects increases to the tax provision of $6 million related to the pro forma income tax effects of the reversal of the tax deductible portion of the merger-related costs incurred by CBS and Viacom described in Note 6 (d). The decreases to “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” of $15 million and “Deferred income tax liabilities, net” of $1 million reflect the impact to income taxes payable and deferred income taxes, respectively, for the tax deductible portion of the merger-related costs described in Note 6 (a) and (b). The pro forma adjustment to “Deferred income tax liabilities, net” was based on the respective deferred tax rates of CBS and Viacom. Combining the two companies is not expected to have a material impact on the deferred tax rate or the valuation allowances and therefore no additional pro forma tax adjustments have been made."
