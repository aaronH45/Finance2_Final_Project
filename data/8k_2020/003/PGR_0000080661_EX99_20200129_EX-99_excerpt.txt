N/A - Our Property business results have a comparable number of operating days in 2019 and 2018.

a Our Commercial Lines business recognized $98 million of net premiums written, as a result of adding an additional state where we write commercial auto insurance coverage for an Uber Technologies subsidiary. Excluding this impact, net premiums written growth was approximately 7% for December 2019.

2The loss/LAE ratio includes an additional 18.7 points due to the reversal of a portion of the reinsurance recoverable under our aggregate stop-loss (ASL) agreements, which cover certain ARX losses and a portion of the LAE associated with those losses. The expense ratio includes 3.4 points of amortization expense predominantly associated with the acquisition of a controlling interest in ARX. Excluding these items, the Property business would have reported a loss/LAE ratio of 45.3, an expense ratio of 26.1, and a combined ratio of 71.4 for December 2019.

3 Represents adjustments solely based on our actuarial reviews. For our Property business, the actuarial reserving methodology includes changes to catastrophe losses, while the reviews in our vehicle businesses do not include catastrophes.

Monthly Commentary

Pursuant to our accounting calendar for 2019, the fourth quarter has 14 weeks of underwriting activity, with December being a 5-week month. Progressive operates on an accounting calendar that typically consists of a 52-week year, with 13-week quarters and a 4-week December. Under this calendar, we periodically recognize an additional week of activity in the year, as is the case for 2019. Consequently, our annual, fourth quarter, and December periods for 2019 each include an additional week, which affects comparisons of those periods to prior years.

In addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks, including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for one or more contingencies. Also, our regular reserve reviews may result in adjustments of varying magnitude as additional information regarding claims activity becomes known. Reported results, therefore, may be volatile in certain accounting periods.
