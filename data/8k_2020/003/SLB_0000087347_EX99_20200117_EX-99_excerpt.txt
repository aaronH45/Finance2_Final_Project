Schlumberger CEO Olivier Le Peuch commented, “Full-year revenue for 2019 was $32.9 billion, a level essentially flat with 2018. Overall performance was positive—particularly in the international markets—and we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow, which was a remarkable achievement under these market conditions. Full-year pretax segment operating margin of 12%, however, was slightly down year-on-year.  

“International revenue, excluding Cameron, grew 8% and was consistent with our expectations of high single-digit growth. Most of our international GeoMarkets benefited from these favorable market conditions, and almost half of them registered double-digit, year-on-year revenue growth driven by exploration activity, offshore operations, and acceleration of the industry’s digital transformation. Compared with the first half of 2019, international pretax segment operating margin improved by 100 basis points (bps) in the second half of the year—a firm step toward our strategic target of margin expansion.  

“In contrast, after two years of strong growth, North American revenue fell sharply, driven largely by the land market weakness affecting our OneStim® pressure pumping business, as customers reached their budget limits earlier in the year and remained highly disciplined on capital spend.  

Full-Year Revenue by Segment

“Among the business segments, Drilling and Reservoir Characterization revenue benefited from their international market exposure, while Production and Cameron contracted year-on-year due to weakness in the North America land market.  

“During the year, we recognized material pretax charges driven by market conditions, particularly in North America. As these charges were largely noncash and primarily related to goodwill, intangible assets, and fixed assets, they did not impede our ability to generate strong cash flow as we demonstrated in the second half of the year.  

“We ended the year building on the strength of our international franchise, driven by the breadth of the international recovery, after four consecutive years of declining revenue. We initiated our scale-to-fit strategy in North America land amid continued challenging market conditions, removed structural costs to protect margins, and accelerated technology-access business models and asset-light operations transformation.  

“The year 2019 marked the beginning of a new chapter for Schlumberger. As we move forward, our vision is to define and drive high performance sustainably—operationally and financially. Simply put, we want to be the performance partner of choice for the benefit of our customers and our industry. Our strategy has favorably positioned Schlumberger to achieve margin expansion, increase return on capital, and grow free cash flow.

Fourth-Quarter Results  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 *  

These are non-GAAP financial measures. See sections titled “Charges & Credits” and “Segments” for details.  

n/m = not meaningful  

“Fourth quarter revenue of $8.2 billion was 4% lower sequentially. International revenue of $5.7 billion grew 2% sequentially and 8% year-on-year. North America revenue of $2.5 billion, however, dropped 14% sequentially due to customer budget exhaustion and cash flow constraints.  

“Sequential international growth was led by the Middle East & Asia area, where revenue increased 5% driven by higher year-end product sales in Kuwait, Iraq, and Oman; delivery of additional lump-sum-turnkey (LSTK) wells in Saudi Arabia; and increased Well Services activity in Qatar. Latin America revenue grew 1% due to stronger WesternGeco® multiclient seismic license sales in the Mexico Bay of Campeche, while revenue in the Europe/CIS/Africa area only declined 2% given the mild winter slowdown of activity in the Northern Hemisphere that was partially mitigated by strong year-end product sales and Software Integrated Solutions (SIS) digital software sales.  

Fourth-Quarter Revenue by Segment  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

n/m = not meaningful  

“Production revenue declined 9% sequentially primarily due to the 33% sequential drop in OneStim revenue as we continued to right-size our hydraulic fracturing capacity by stacking more fleets in the face of lower demand. This is part of the scale-to-fit strategy we are deploying in North America land—rationalizing our business portfolio to achieve improved returns and better profitability. Drilling and Reservoir Characterization revenue each decreased 1% sequentially due to the end of summer campaigns in the North Sea and Russia. These effects, however, were partially offset by increased drilling activity in the Middle East & Asia area and stronger SIS digital software sales across several GeoMarkets. Cameron revenue increased 2% sequentially from higher OneSubsea®, Surface Systems, and Drilling Systems sales—primarily in the international markets.

“I’m very pleased with our operational and financial results as we closed 2019, and I’m encouraged by the sustained international activity growth, although conditions in North America land became more challenging. Fourth-quarter EPS of $0.39, excluding charges and credits, was sequentially lower, but was 8% higher than the same quarter last year. Pretax segment operating margin declined sequentially on seasonal effects but improved when compared to the same quarter last year. This quarter delivered the first sequential growth in international margin in any fourth quarter since 2014. We are therefore confident we have turned the corner, particularly as we have now seen sequential international margin growth for the last three quarters as a result of our discipline and focus on execution performance. Meanwhile, in North America land, we minimized the margin dilution from lower activity by implementing our scale-to-fit strategy, acting decisively in reducing capacity, and restructuring our operations.  

“In addition, we generated significant cashflow from operations as we ended the year, leveraging our capital stewardship program. We also completed two major milestones during the quarter: the formation of the Sensia joint venture and the divestiture of our Drilling Tools business. The proceeds from these transactions further supported the significant reduction of our net debt during the quarter.  

“From a macro perspective, we ended the year with 2020 oil demand growth sentiment turning positive as uncertainty reduced following the progress made toward a US-China trade deal. The fall in the North America production growth estimate of between 400,000 to 800,000 bpd should continue to support the thesis for international investment. The recent escalation of geopolitical risk should set the floor for the oil price going forward. In the near term, we expect the OPEC+ production cuts agreed upon in December 2019 to limit investment and activity, particularly in the Middle East and Russia, during the first half of 2020. As the year progresses, the effect of slowing North America production growth is likely to cause tightness in the market and further stimulate international operators to step up their investments in the second half of the year and beyond.  

“Based on this, we expect 2020 E&P capex spending growth rate in the international markets to be in the mid-single-digit range. We would therefore expect our international portfolio revenue to grow at the same pace or higher, excluding the effects of the Sensia and Drilling Tools transactions. The carved-out businesses in these transactions accounted for approximately 2% of our global revenue in 2019. International revenue growth will be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year with increasing offshore activity, improving activity mix from the early deepwater growth cycle, and increasing exploration work toward the end of the year and into 2021.  

“In North America, we are continuing to scale-to-fit our organization and portfolio by repurposing or exiting underperforming business units, focusing on asset-light operations, and expanding our technology access business models. In alignment with our stated strategy, we are cautiously optimistic that the high-grading of our portfolio will promote margin expansion and the improvement of returns in the North America land market. It has also led to the closing of a significant number of facilities and, unfortunately, workforce reductions.  

“After a strong free cash flow performance in the second half of 2019, we are confident in our ability to further improve cash flow generation in 2020. Our focus on improved margins, capital stewardship, and careful management of working capital will continue to underpin our ability to generate improved free cash flow.  

“All in all, we finished the year with a very solid quarter, aligned with our performance vision and our focus on returns. I am very pleased with the results, and I’m proud of the Schlumberger team that delivered this performance.”

Consolidated Revenue by Area  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

n/m = not meaningful  

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  

Fourth-quarter revenue of $8.2 billion decreased 4% sequentially. North America revenue of $2.5 billion decreased 14% while international revenue of $5.7 billion increased 2%.  

North America  

North America area consolidated revenue of $2.5 billion was 14% lower sequentially. The sequential decline was driven by lower activity and pricing for our OneStim and Drilling businesses in North America land due to expected customer budget limitations and cash flow constraints. North America land revenue declined 19% sequentially while North America offshore revenue grew by 3%. OneStim revenue dropped 33% sequentially as we continued to right-size our hydraulic fracturing capacity by stacking more fleets in the face of lower demand. This is part of the scale-to-fit strategy we are deploying in North America land—rationalizing our business portfolio to achieve improved returns and better profitability.  

5   

International  

Consolidated revenue in the Latin America area of $1.0 billion increased 1% sequentially. This was due primarily to higher WesternGeco multiclient seismic license sales in the Mexico Bay of Campeche, partially offset by lower revenue in Argentina on reduced drilling and well services activity. Revenue in Ecuador declined slightly from production shut-ins caused by civil unrest that occurred at the beginning of the quarter. Cameron revenue was higher on increased Surface Systems sales in the Mexico & Central America GeoMarket.  

Europe/CIS/Africa area consolidated revenue of $2.0 billion decreased 2% sequentially. This was driven by the winter slowdown of wireline and well services activity following the end of summer campaigns in the North Sea and Russia, partially offset by increased SIS digital software sales and Artificial Lift Solutions product sales across the area. Higher revenue in the Sub-Sahara Africa and North Africa GeoMarkets from new project startups also helped mitigate the seasonal decline of activity in the Northern Hemisphere. Cameron revenue was higher on increased Valves & Process Systems (VPS) sales in Russia and increased OneSubsea project and service activity in Norway.  

Consolidated revenue in the Middle East & Asia area of $2.7 billion increased 5% sequentially. This was driven by increased Middle East revenue from higher Completions, Artificial Lift Solutions, and M-I SWACO product sales in Kuwait, Iraq, and Oman; delivery of additional LSTK wells in Saudi Arabia; and increased Well Services activity in Qatar. Revenues in the South & East Asia and Far East Asia & Australia GeoMarkets were also higher sequentially from increased SIS digital software and Completions product sales. Cameron revenue was higher from increased OneSubsea activity in India.  

Reservoir Characterization  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion, 83% of which came from the international markets, decreased 1% sequentially following the end of the summer campaigns for wireline and testing activity in the North Sea and Russia, where the mild winter did not significantly disrupt activity. This decline was partially offset by higher SIS digital software sales across several GeoMarkets. WesternGeco multiclient seismic license sales were also lower as increased sales in the Mexico Bay of Campeche were more than offset by reduced activity in the US Gulf of Mexico.  

Reservoir Characterization pretax operating margin of 22% increased 59 bps sequentially due to increased SIS digital software sales. The margin expansion was partially offset by the seasonal decline in Wireline revenue and reduced multiclient seismic licensing activity.  

Drilling  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Drilling revenue of $2.4 billion, 76% of which came from the international markets, decreased 1% sequentially due to the end of the summer drilling campaign in Russia and lower drilling activity in North America land largely impacting M-I SWACO and Bits & Drilling Tools. These declines were partially offset by increased drilling activity in the Middle East & Asia area, mainly from the delivery of additional LSTK wells in Saudi Arabia.  

6   

Drilling pretax operating margin of 12% was flat sequentially as margin improvements from drilling projects in the Middle East were offset by the seasonally lower margins in Russia and lower drilling margins in North America land.  

Production  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Production revenue of $2.9 billion, of which 61% came from the international markets, declined 9% sequentially. This was driven by OneStim revenue, which dropped 33% sequentially as we continued to right-size our hydraulic fracturing capacity by stacking more fleets in the face of lower demand. This is part of the deployment of our scale-to-fit strategy in North America land—rationalizing our business portfolio to achieve improved returns and better profitability. In addition, sand and proppant supply revenue also declined. These declines, however, were partially offset by increased international completions activity in Kuwait, Oman, and the South & East Asia GeoMarket. Higher project activity for Asset Performance Solutions (APS), formerly known as Schlumberger Production Management (SPM), contributed positively to the quarter despite the temporary production shut-in issues in Ecuador.  

Production pretax operating margin of 9% contracted by 32 bps sequentially due to lower OneStim activity, partially offset by strength in international margins from higher activity.  

Cameron  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cameron revenue of $1.4 billion, of which 60% came from international markets, increased 2% sequentially from higher OneSubsea, Surface Systems, and Drilling Systems revenue—primarily in the international markets. VPS was lower sequentially due to the reduced North America land activity and as a result of contributing the VPS measurement business to the Sensia joint venture. By geography, international revenue grew 7% sequentially, primarily on strong growth in the Norway & Denmark and Far East & Australia GeoMarkets, while North America revenue declined by 7% on weak land activity.  

Cameron pretax operating margin of 9% contracted by 359 bps sequentially, driven largely by reduced margins in the OneSubsea project portfolio. Lower North America land activity also resulted in reduced margins, particularly for VPS and Surface Systems.  

Quarterly Highlights  

The combination of unique Schlumberger team and technology performance, centered on customer and industry challenges, delivers the potential for market and financial outperformance. Within this vision, the deployment of fit-for-basin technology and business models creates differentiation for Schlumberger. Examples of this during the quarter include:  

7   

   •    

In Norway, Schlumberger, Aker BP, and StimWell Services created a Well Intervention and Stimulation Alliance, entering into a 5+5-year tripartite agreement. Through collaboration, innovative technologies, and digitization, the newly formed alliance endeavors to completely transform conventional intervention operations with clear targets for propelling hydrocarbon production on new and existing assets on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The alliance focus will span interventions operations, with Schlumberger as partner for wireline logging, perforation, and well stimulation through digital slickline, coiled tubing, and flowback operations on Aker BP’s fixed installations, and StimWell as partner for the provision of fracturing services, using vessel-based stimulation services. An early success for the alliance was the execution of the single-trip, multifrac operation at the Valhall Field running a world’s-first type of stimulation methodology with coiled tubing in an offshore environment, resulting in significant time savings.  

   •    

In Kuwait and for the first time in the Middle East, Drilling & Measurements deployed GeoSphere HD* reservoir mapping-while-drilling service for Kuwait Oil Company. This service enabled mapping oil/water contact at a 40-ft total vertical depth from the tool measuring point while drilling. The technology has proved that it will reduce operating costs for similar wells by $550,000 per well in the Umm Gudair Field by eliminating the need for drilling pilot holes to confirm the oil/water contact zones.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

OneSubsea integrated subsea production, multiphase boosting, and gas compression are industry-leading technologies that help improve customer performance. These technologies are also enabling Subsea Integration Alliance (SIA) to expand its global business with awards for engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contracts. SIA brings together field development planning, project delivery, and total lifecycle solutions under an extensive technology and services portfolio. Examples of subsea technology and integration for the quarter include:  

   •    

A/S Norske Shell awarded OneSubsea a frame agreement for an engineering, procurement, construction, and installation (EPCI) contract for the supply of a subsea multiphase compression system for the Ormen Lange Field in the Norwegian Sea. Through the EPCI contract, SIA will install a subsea multiphase compression system that uses the industry’s only subsea multiphase compression technology. In the first phase of the project, OneSubsea will do the engineering and design of the complete system. Following the final investment decision by the license group, the complete scope of the EPCI will be executed.  

   •    

Chevron U.S.A. Inc. awarded OneSubsea an EPC contract for the supply of an integrated subsea production and multiphase boosting system for the Anchor Field in the US Gulf of Mexico. The contract includes vertical monobore production trees and multiphase flowmeters rated up to 20,000 psi. Also included are production manifolds and an integrated manifold multiphase pump station rated to 16,500 psi as well as subsea controls and distribution. This is the first 20,000-psi subsea production system contract in the industry.  

   •    

Woodside awarded SIA an EPCI contract for the Sangomar Field Development project offshore Senegal. The project includes the development of the deepwater Sangomar oil field, which is located 100 km south of Dakar. Project work scope includes the EPCI of subsea production systems and a subsea umbilical, riser, and flowline system. The development will include 23 wells in a water depth between 650 m and 1,400 m. Offshore installation activities are scheduled from 2021 to 2023 and first oil production is expected in early 2023. Through this contract, OneSubsea will supply a portfolio of standard systems, including 23 wellhead systems, 11 subsea production trees, 10 water injection trees, two gas injection trees, topside controls, and intervention tools and life-of-field support.  

8   

Schlumberger achieved new milestones in the digital transformation of E&P processes and workflows during the quarter. The DELFI* cognitive E&P environment will be further enhanced by best-in-class artificial intelligence, empowering our customers to draw actionable insights and make faster decisions. Examples of this include:  

   •    

Schlumberger and Dataiku entered into an exclusive technology partnership that will enable the E&P industry to build and deploy its own artificial intelligence solutions across the full breadth of its upstream workflows within the DELFI environment. The partnership will deliver unprecedented capabilities to petrotechnical domain experts by bridging the gap between machine learning and domain expertise to enable better insights. As a result, the upstream industry will have access to an innovation platform where customers can accelerate the deployment of new solutions across their organizations.  

   •    

Schlumberger and ExxonMobil are jointly working on the deployment of digital drilling solutions around planning, execution, and continuous improvement through learning. As the first step in this journey, ExxonMobil has agreed to a commercial deployment of DrillPlan* coherent well construction planning solution in ExxonMobil’s unconventional operations. The agreement is expected to enable increased efficiency, procedural adherence, and consistency in well construction through digital well planning in the DELFI environment using the DrillPlan solution workflows.  

In December, Schlumberger became the first company in upstream E&P services to commit to setting a science-based target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, as defined by the Science Based Targets initiative. Calculated using expertise from Schlumberger’s extensive scientific community, Schlumberger’s science-based target will align with the goals of the United Nations Paris Agreement.

Liquidity  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)   

“Net Debt” represents gross debt less cash, short-term investments and fixed income investments, held to maturity. Management believes that Net Debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt. Net Debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, total debt.  

 (2)   

Includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, multiclient seismic data costs and APS investments.   

 (3)   

Includes severance payments of $128 million and $24 million during the twelve months and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019, respectively; and $340 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.  

 (4)   

“Free cash flow” represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, APS investments and multiclient seismic data costs capitalized. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of Schlumberger’s ability to generate cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as substitute for or superior to, cash flow from operations.  

12   

Charges & Credits  

In addition to financial results determined in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this full-year and fourth-quarter 2019 earnings release also includes non-GAAP financial measures (as defined under the SEC’s Regulation G). In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above under “Liquidity”, net income (loss), excluding charges & credits, as well as measures derived from it (including diluted EPS, excluding charges & credits; Schlumberger net income (loss), excluding charges & credits; and effective tax rate, excluding charges & credits) are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the exclusion of charges & credits from these financial measures enables it to evaluate more effectively Schlumberger’s operations period over period and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked by the excluded items. These measures are also used by management as performance measures in determining certain incentive compensation. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures.
