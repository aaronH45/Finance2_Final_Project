Invesco Reports Results for the Three Months and Year Ended December 31, 2019 

Atlanta, January 29, 2020 --- Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Update from Marty Flanagan, President and CEO

“The integration of OppenheimerFunds has significantly strengthened our ability to meet client needs and achieve strong operating results on behalf of shareholders, including a 15.6% increase in net revenues and a 38.1% growth in AUM year over year.

“Long-term net outflows totaled $34.4 billion for 2019, which represented an improvement of 11.8% over the prior year. The firm is highly focused on delivering the additional capabilities achieved through the acquisition to the institutional and ex-US markets, which is helping to move the flow trend in a positive direction.

“We believe the further deepening of client relationships, expanded capabilities and additional scale achieved through the acquisition meaningfully enhanced our ability to grow our business, compete and win in a dynamic market environment.

“We’re also pleased with the increased clarity on Brexit and US-China trade, both of which led investors to de-risk and put pressure on key parts of our business. Resolving these issues will help us build on the positive net flows we saw throughout 2019 in our business outside the Americas.

“Lastly, we’re pleased to have returned $1.2 billion to shareholders during 2019, and remain focused on delivering a high level of value for our clients and shareholders while further positioning our business for long-term success.”

Net flows: Total net outflows were $20.4 billion and long-term net outflows were $14.0 billion for the fourth quarter. Long-term net outflows in the Americas and the UK were partially offset by long-term net inflows in Asia and EMEA ex-UK. Net market gains and foreign exchange rate movements led to increases of $39.6 billion and $9.6 billion in AUM during the fourth quarter, respectively. Reinvested distributions for the fourth quarter were $13.0 billion compared to $2.2 billion for the third quarter. Average AUM increased 1.0% during the fourth quarter to $1,200.6 billion, compared to $1,188.2 billion for the third quarter.

Fourth Quarter Operating Results:

Operating revenues and expenses: Operating revenues increased while operating expenses decreased in the fourth quarter as compared to third quarter.

Revenues grew by $22.2 million during the quarter, including a $9.7 million increase due to movements in foreign currency rates. The revenue growth included an increase of $34.9 million in performance fees. The increase was partially offset by decreases of $7.1 million in service and distribution fees and a decrease of $2.9 million in investment management fees (net of $7.9 million in foreign currency increases). Performance fees were $49.8 million in the fourth quarter and resulted primarily from real estate products.

Expenses were down $17.3 million, net of an increase of $9.2 million from foreign currency movements and revaluations. The decrease included lower transaction, integration, and restructuring expenses of $49.0 million. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense decreased $17.0 million driven by lower service fees. Employee compensation expense grew $14.1 million due primarily to fair value increases on deferred compensation. Marketing costs reflect higher advertising activity in Asia and EMEA, resulting in an increase of $7.8 million for the fourth quarter. General and administrative expense includes increased levels of regulatory and legal costs, higher fund launch costs, investments in the digital wealth business and a seasonal increase in travel costs, resulting in a rise of $17.2 million for the quarter. 

3

Non-operating income and expenses:  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was $9.5 million, earned primarily from our Chinese joint ventures. Interest and dividend income was $14.0 million for the fourth quarter, which primarily represents year-end distributions from investments. Other gains and losses, net was a loss of $3.3 million, which includes $6.5 million in net investment gains and $12.5 million gains on deferred compensation investments, offset by the impact of foreign currency rate changes related to the settlement of non-US intercompany dividends. Other income/(expense) of consolidated investment products (CIP), net was a net gain of $22.8 million comprised of market-driven gains and losses of investments held by CIP and net interest income of CIP.

Diluted earnings per common share:  Diluted earnings per common share increased 8.3% to $0.39 for the fourth quarter.

Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliations

We utilize the following non-GAAP performance measures: net revenues (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM), adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd., and adjusted diluted EPS. We believe the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into our ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to our competitors. These measures also assist management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts and assist the Board of Directors and management in determining incentive compensation decisions. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on AUM), operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Invesco Ltd., and diluted EPS.

The following are reconciliations of operating revenues, operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. (and by calculation, diluted EPS) on a U.S. GAAP basis to a non-GAAP basis of net revenues, adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS). In addition, a reconciliation of adjusted operating expenses is provided below, together with reconciliations of the U.S. GAAP operating expense lines to provide further analysis of the non-GAAP adjustments. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any U.S. GAAP measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The tax effect of the reconciling items is based on the tax jurisdiction attributable to the transactions. These measures are described more fully in the company's Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Refer to these public filings for additional information about the company's non-GAAP performance measures.

Management believes that adjustments to investment management fees, service and distribution fees and other revenues from operating revenues appropriately reflect these revenues as being passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the company’s managed funds. Further, these adjustments vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels. The net revenue presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with U.S. peer investment managers and within Invesco’s own investment units. Additionally, management evaluates net revenue yield on AUM, which is equal to net revenues divided by average AUM during the reporting period. This financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of AUM we manage and is useful when evaluating the company’s performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes. 

Investment management fees are adjusted by renewal commissions and certain administrative fees. Service and distribution fees are primarily adjusted by distribution fees passed through to broker dealers for certain share classes and pass through fund-related costs. Other is primarily adjusted by transaction fees passed through to third parties. While the terms used for these types of adjustments vary by geography, they are all costs that are closely linked to the value of AUM and the revenue earned by Invesco from AUM. Since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the third-party arrangements, the company must reflect these adjustments as expenses gross of operating revenues under U.S. GAAP in third-party expenses on the consolidated statements of income.

(2)As a result of an increase in our recoverable VAT from applying additional regulatory guidance, a credit was recorded in the third quarter of 2018. The portion of the cumulative adjustment representing 2014 through 2017 has been removed for non-GAAP purposes.

(3)Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues.

(4)Adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(6)Adjusted diluted EPS is equal to adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. divided by the weighted average number of common and restricted common shares outstanding. There is no difference between the calculated earnings per common share amounts presented above and the calculated earnings per common share amounts under the two class method.

Footnotes to the Assets Under Management Tables

(a) In the second quarter of 2019, the company changed the presentation of its AUM. The presentation reflects the combination of the U.S and Canada to form Americas and Continental Europe to now be EMEA ex U.K. Additionally, the company reclassified certain AUM between asset classes. In the AUM tables above, all periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation.

(b) Non-management fee earning AUM includes non-management fee earning ETFs, UIT and product leverage.

(c) Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding Invesco Great Wall AUM. For quarterly AUM, the average AUM for Invesco Great Wall included in the yield calculation in the three months ended December 31, 2019 was $38.4 billion (September 30, 2019: $37.4 billion; 2019: $35.6 billion; 2018: $16.2 billion).

It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of Invesco Great Wall for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the net income of Invesco Great Wall is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, is not considered a meaningful effective fee rate measure. The numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from CIP; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM.

(d) Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM. See the reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Information on pages 8 through 11 of this release for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.

(e) The alternatives asset class includes absolute return, commodities, currencies, financial structures, global macro, long/short equity, managed futures, multi-alternatives, private capital - direct, private capital - fund of funds, private direct real estate, public real estate securities, senior secured loans and custom solutions.

(f) Long-term AUM excludes institutional money market and non-management fee earning AUM. Ending AUM as of December 31, 2019 includes $91.4 billion in institutional money market AUM and $126.8 billion in non-management fee earning AUM (September 30, 2019: $97.8 billion and $115.9 billion, respectively; December 31, 2018: $83.7 billion and $87.5 billion, respectively).

(g) Passive AUM include index-based ETFs, unit investment trusts (UITs), non-fee earning leverage, foreign exchange overlays and other passive mandates. Active AUM is total AUM less Passive AUM.

(h) The acquisition of OppenheimerFunds on May 24, 2019 added $224.4 billion in AUM.

Investment Capabilities Performance Overview

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Note:Excludes passive products, closed-end funds, private equity limited partnerships, non-discretionary funds, unit investment trusts, fund of funds with component funds managed by Invesco, stable value building block funds and CDOs. Certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision. AUM measured in the one, three, five and ten year quartile rankings represents 58%, 57%, 57% and 51% of total Invesco AUM, respectively, and AUM measured versus benchmark on a one, three, five and ten year basis represents 68%, 67%, 65% and 57% of total Invesco AUM as of 12/31/19. Peer group rankings are sourced from a widely-used third party ranking agency in each fund’s market (Lipper, Morningstar, IA, Russell, Mercer, eVestment Alliance, SITCA, Value Research) and asset-weighted in USD. Rankings are as of prior quarter-end for most institutional products and prior month-end for Australian retail funds due to their late release by third parties. Rankings are calculated against all funds in each peer group. Rankings for the primary share class of the most representative fund in each composite are applied to all products within each composite. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor’s experience.  

(1)Numbers in parenthesis reflect percentage of Total Ranked AUM. Total Ranked AUM is $696.5 billion for the fourth quarter.
