DEERFIELD, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 29, 2020--Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. (NYSE: FBHS), an industry-leading home and security products company, today announced fourth quarter and year end 2019 results.  

 “Our strong results during the fourth quarter reflect our team’s ability to execute well in a housing market with modest growth and tariff challenges,” said Nicholas Fink, chief executive officer, Fortune Brands. “Our Plumbing business continues to outperform its market with exciting consumer-driven innovation and category expansion. The momentum we have in the value price point segment of our Cabinets business is proof our accelerated pivot plans are working. Distribution gains in composite decking products should provide a tailwind for our Doors & Security division during 2020 and beyond. As we look into the next year, we have multiple growth initiatives to pursue in a strengthening market, and we are keenly focused on capturing those opportunities.”  

 Fourth Quarter 2019  

 For the fourth quarter of 2019, sales were $1.5 billion, an increase of 4 percent over the fourth quarter of 2018. Earnings per share were $0.74, compared to $0.60 in the prior-year quarter. EPS before charges / gains were $1.00, compared to $0.86 the same quarter last year. Operating income was $192.5 million, compared to $140.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating income before charges / gains was $206.8 million, compared to $180.6 million the same quarter last year, up 15 percent.  

 For each segment in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to the prior-year quarter:    Plumbing sales increased 12 percent led by outperformance in China and the U.S. Operating margin before charges / gains continued at leading 21.7 percent margins.   Cabinet sales decreased 5 percent versus the prior year but were roughly flat excluding the 53rd week in 2018. In the U.S., growth in value priced cabinets was offset by softness in more premium products. Operating margin before charges / gains was 10.1 percent.   Doors & Security sales increased 8 percent, driven by continued, strong double-digit sales growth of composite decking and solid operating performance in security products versus the comparable quarter last year. Operating margin before charges / gains was 14.9 percent, which was up over 600 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2018.   

 Full Year 2019  

 For the full year 2019, sales were nearly $5.8 billion, an increase of 5 percent over 2018, 6 percent excluding FX. Earnings per share were $3.06 compared to $2.66 in the prior year, and EPS before charges / gains were $3.60 versus $3.34 last year, an increase of 8 percent.  

 “We have executed in a year that was more challenging than anticipated. Balance sheet strength from our continued strong free cash flow profile has enabled us to further delever, and we now enter 2020 at 2x net debt to EBITDA, before charges / gains,” stated Patrick Hallinan, chief financial officer, Fortune Brands. “We will continue to be focused on driving shareholder value through M&A, strategic partnerships, opportunistic share repurchases and maintaining a healthy dividend.”  

 Annual Outlook for 2020   

 The Company expects full-year 2020 sales growth in the range of 5 percent to 6 percent, based on our assumption of a total global market expanding by 3 percent to 5 percent, including growth in the U.S. home products market of approximately 4 percent to 6 percent.  

 The Company expects EPS before charges / gains to be in the range of $3.83 to $4.03.  

 For 2020, the Company expects to generate free cash flow of $565 to $585 million.  

 “Our teams delivered sales and profit growth despite continued market and tariff headwinds,” said Fink. “We believe there will be a better home products market in 2020. We have put in place a prudent plan to generate solid EPS growth in 2020 and could have upside to that plan should U.S. new construction growth exceed expectations, or we generate meaningful additional share gains from the current effects of anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese cabinet imports.”
