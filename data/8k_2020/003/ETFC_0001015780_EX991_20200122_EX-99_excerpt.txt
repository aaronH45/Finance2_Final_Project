 Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures  

 Management believes that adjusting GAAP measures by excluding or including certain items is helpful to investors and analysts who may wish to use some or all of this information to analyze the Company’s current performance, prospects, and valuation. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally to evaluate operating performance and in formulating the budget for future periods. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures discussed below are appropriate for evaluating the operating and liquidity performance of the Company.  

 Adjusted Operating Margin  

 Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted income before income taxes by net revenue. Adjusted income before income taxes excludes the provision (benefit) for loan losses and losses on early extinguishment of debt. Management believes that excluding the provision (benefit) for loan losses and losses on early extinguishment of debt from operating margin provides a useful measure of the Company's ongoing operating performance because management excludes these when evaluating operating margin performance. See endnote (4) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  

 Adjusted Return on Common Equity  

 Adjusted return on common equity is calculated by dividing annualized adjusted net income available to common shareholders by average common shareholders' equity, which excludes preferred stock. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders excludes the after-tax impact of the provision (benefit) for loan losses and losses on early extinguishment of debt. Management believes that excluding the provision (benefit) for loan losses and losses on early extinguishment of debt from net income available to common shareholders provides a useful measure of the Company's ongoing operating performance because management excludes these when evaluating return on common equity performance. See endnote (7) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  

 Tangible Common Equity Book Value per Share  

 Tangible common equity book value per share represents common shareholders’ equity, which excludes preferred stock, less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of related deferred tax liabilities) divided by common stock outstanding. The Company believes that tangible common equity book value per share is a measure of the Company’s capital strength. See endnote (8) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  

 Corporate Cash  

 Corporate cash represents cash held at the parent company as well as cash held in certain subsidiaries, not including bank and brokerage subsidiaries, that can distribute cash to the parent company without any regulatory approval or notification. The Company believes that corporate cash is a useful measure of the parent company’s liquidity as it is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in regulated subsidiaries. See endnote (9) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  

 It is important to note that these non-GAAP measures may involve judgment by management and should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or superior to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. For additional information on the adjustments to these non-GAAP measures, please see the Company’s financial statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” that will be included in the periodic report the Company expects to file with the SEC with respect to the financial periods discussed herein.

 Corporate cash includes the parent company's deposits placed with E*TRADE Bank. E*TRADE Bank may use these deposits for investment purposes; however, these investments are not included in consolidated cash and equivalents.    

 (10) Beginning in November 2019, the definition of DARTs was updated to reflect all customer-directed trades. This includes trades associated with no-transaction-fee mutual funds, options trades through the Dime Buyback Program, and all exchange-traded funds transactions (including those formerly classified as commission-free). DARTs is calculated by dividing these customer-directed trades by the number of trading days during the period. This update did not result in a significant impact to the presentation of DARTs, derivative DARTs, and derivative DARTs %. Prior periods have been updated to conform with the current period presentation.

 Under the regulatory guidelines for risk-based capital, on-balance sheet assets, and credit-equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-weighted assets.
