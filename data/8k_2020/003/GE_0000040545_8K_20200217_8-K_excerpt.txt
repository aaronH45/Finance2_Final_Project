Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

As previously reported by General Electric Company (“GE” or the “Company”) on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 31, 2019, Jamie Miller will transition from her role as the Company’s Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) after assisting with the transition to her successor. As announced on November 25, 2019, the Company has appointed Carolina Dybeck Happe as its next Senior Vice President, CFO. The Company expects Ms. Dybeck Happe to commence employment with the Company as Senior Vice President, CFO on March 1, 2020.

On February 17, 2020, Ms. Miller and the Company entered into a Separation Agreement & Release (the “Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Ms. Miller will remain employed with the Company until September 30, 2020, or such earlier date as may be agreed between Ms. Miller and the Company (the “Separation Date”), during which period she will be eligible to receive her regular salary and benefits. Following Ms. Dybeck Happe’s commencing employment as Senior Vice President, CFO, Ms. Miller will remain employed in a special projects role to assist with the CFO transition and to work on such other matters and projects as may be directed by the Chief Executive Officer. 

Under the terms of the Agreement, GE will provide certain compensation arrangements, including: (1) Ms. Miller will receive severance pay in the amount of $2,900,000 (equal to one times her annual salary and target bonus), paid in equal bi-weekly installments for the twelve-month period following the Separation Date, during which time Ms. Miller must be available to provide reasonable transition assistance and answer questions related to her Company employment; (2) Ms. Miller will receive a bonus for the 2020 plan year at no less than the Corporate pool funding level, which shall be pro-rated based on time employed with the Company during the year; (3) Ms. Miller’s outstanding stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted at least one year prior to the Separation Date and that would otherwise vest through December 31, 2022 will vest as soon as practicable after the Separation Date, and such stock options will have an exercise period up to the earlier of their existing expiration date and December 31, 2022; and (4) Ms. Miller’s outstanding performance share units (“PSUs”) that were granted at least one year prior to the Separation Date will remain eligible to vest based upon the Company’s actual performance in accordance with GE’s normal processes. The Company anticipates that Ms. Miller will not receive an annual equity award in 2020. Based upon her age and years of service, Ms. Miller is not eligible to receive a GE pension or benefits under the GE Supplementary Pension Plan, and she will not receive any pension benefits under the terms of the Agreement. Under the Agreement, Ms. Miller has granted a release to the Company and agreed to certain cooperation, confidential information, non-competition, and non-solicitation covenants.
