 ITEM 1.01  

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement   

On January 9, 2020, Range Resources Corporation (the “Company”) entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company, Range Louisiana Operating, LLC, Range Production Company, LLC, Range Resources—Appalachia, LLC, Range Resources—Louisiana, Inc., Range Resources—Midcontinent, LLC and Range Resources—Pine Mountain, Inc. (collectively, the “Subsidiary Guarantors”) and BofA Securities, Inc., as representative of the several initial purchasers named therein (collectively, the “Initial Purchasers”), by which the Company agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase, $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 9.25% senior notes due 2026 (the “Notes”) in accordance with exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) afforded by Rule 144A and Regulation S. The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Company estimates that the net proceeds of the offering will be approximately $541.6 million after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discounts and estimated expenses of the offering payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to purchase Target Notes in the Tender Offers (each as defined below), including fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith, with the remainder to be used to repay borrowings under its bank credit facility. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws.  

Some of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with the Company or its affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. In particular, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are lenders under the Company’s bank credit facility and may receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering used to repay such bank credit facility. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hold a portion of the Company’s 5.750% senior notes due 2021, 5.875% senior notes due 2022 and/or 5.000% senior notes due 2022 (collectively, the “Target Notes”) that may be purchased in the tender offers commenced by the Company to purchase the Target Notes for cash (the “Tender Offers”), and such Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering.  

The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the parties, conditions to closing, indemnification rights and termination provisions. The Company has agreed with the Initial Purchasers not to offer or sell any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company having a term of more than one year other than the Notes for a period of 60 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement without the prior written consent of BofA Securities, Inc. The closing of the issuance and sale of the Notes is expected to occur on January 24, 2020, subject to customary closing conditions. A copy of the Purchase Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of the Purchase Agreement in this report is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Purchase Agreement.  

 ITEM 7.01  

Regulation FD Disclosure   

On January 9, 2020, the Company issued a press release announcing the pricing of the offering of the Notes. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated into this Item 7.01 by reference.  

The press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which the offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.  

In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, is deemed to be “furnished” and shall not be deemed “filed” for the purpose of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall such information and exhibits be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.
