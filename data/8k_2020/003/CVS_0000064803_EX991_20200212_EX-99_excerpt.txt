Non-GAAP Financial Information

The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures to analyze underlying business performance and trends. The Company believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies.

Non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health, adjusted revenues and adjusted operating expenses exclude from the relevant GAAP metrics, as applicable: amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance.

For the periods covered in this press release, the following items are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures described above, as applicable, because the Company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance:

•The Company’s acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting which consist primarily of trademarks, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology, provider networks and value of business acquired. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in the Company’s statements of operations in operating expenses within each segment. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. 

•During the three months and year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relate to the Aetna Acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2018, acquisition-related integration costs also relate to the acquisition of Omnicare, Inc. The acquisition-related transaction and integration costs are reflected in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses primarily within the Corporate/Other segment. 

•During the year ended December 31, 2019, the store rationalization charges relate to the planned closure of 46 underperforming retail pharmacy stores during the second quarter of 2019 and the planned closure of 22 underperforming retail pharmacy stores during the first quarter of 2020. The store rationalization charges primarily relate to operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges and are reflected in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the Retail/LTC segment. 

•During the year ended December 31, 2019, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of Onofre, which occurred on July 1, 2019. The loss on divestiture primarily relates to the elimination of the cumulative translation adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the loss on divestiture of subsidiary represents the pre-tax loss on the sale of the Company’s RxCrossroads subsidiary for $725 million on January 2, 2018. The losses on divestiture of subsidiary are reflected in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations in operating expenses within the Retail/LTC segment.

•During the year ended December 31, 2019, the loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to the Company’s repayment of $4.0 billion of its outstanding senior notes in August 2019 pursuant to its tender offers for such senior notes. 

•During the three months and year ended December 31, 2018, the goodwill impairment charges relate to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. 

11

•During the three months and year ended December 31, 2018, impairment of long-lived assets primarily relates to the impairment of property and equipment within the Retail/LTC segment and is reflected in operating expenses in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The corresponding tax benefit or expense related to the items excluded from adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health and Adjusted EPS above. The nature of each non-GAAP adjustment is evaluated to determine whether a discrete adjustment should be made to the adjusted income tax provision. 

See endnotes (1) through (4) for definitions of non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented on pages 13 through 17 and 24 through 25.

Supplemental Information

(Unaudited)

The Company’s segments maintain separate financial information, and the Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) evaluates the segments’ operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments based on adjusted operating income. Effective for the first quarter of 2019, adjusted operating income is defined as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance as further described in endnote (1). Segment financial information for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018 has been retrospectively adjusted to conform with the current period presentation. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. 

Effective for the first quarter of 2019, the Company realigned the composition of its segments to correspond with changes to its operating model and reflect how the CODM reviews information and manages the business. As a result of this realignment, the Company’s SilverScript PDP moved from the Pharmacy Services segment to the Health Care Benefits segment. In addition, the Company moved Aetna’s mail order and specialty pharmacy operations from the Health Care Benefits segment to the Pharmacy Services segment. Segment financial information for the year ended December 31, 2018 was retrospectively adjusted to reflect these changes as reported in Exhibit 99.2 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 8, 2019. Segment financial information for the three months ended December 31, 2018, has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect these changes as shown below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_____________________________________________ 

(a)As of the Aetna Acquisition Date, the Company reclassified $776 million of the Pharmacy Services segment’s unpaid retail pharmacy claims to third parties from pharmacy claims and discounts payable to health care costs payable as the third party liability was incurred to support the Health Care Benefits segment’s insured members.

(b)Negative amounts reported for incurred health care costs related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_____________________________________________ 

(a)Days claims payable is calculated by dividing the health care costs payable at the end of each quarter by the average health care costs per day during each respective quarter. Days claims payable is not directly comparable to the legacy Aetna metric due to the addition of approximately 6.0 million SilverScript standalone Medicare PDP members to the Health Care Benefits segment in each period presented as a result of the segment realignment in the first quarter of 2019.

Endnotes

(1)  The Company defines adjusted operating income as operating income (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance, such as acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, store rationalization charges, gains/losses on divestitures, goodwill impairments, impairment of long-lived assets, interest income on financings associated with proposed acquisitions (for periods prior to the acquisition), and any other items specifically identified herein. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” earlier in this press release for additional information regarding the items excluded from operating income.

(2) The Company defines adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health as income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance, such as acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, store rationalization charges, gains/losses on divestitures, losses on early extinguishment of debt, goodwill impairments, impairment of long-lived assets, net interest expense on financings associated with proposed acquisitions (for periods prior to the acquisition), the corresponding income tax benefit or expense related to the items excluded from adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health, the corresponding impact to income allocable to participating securities, net of tax, related to the items excluded from income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health in determining adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health, and any other items specifically identified herein. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS, respectively, are calculated by dividing income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health and adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health by the Company’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding.

 Adjusted EPS for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018 is calculated utilizing adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding, which include 5 million and 3 million potential common equivalent shares, respectively, as the impact of these shares was dilutive. The potential common equivalent shares were excluded from the calculation of GAAP loss per share from continuing operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018, as these shares would have had an anti-dilutive effect as a result of the GAAP net loss incurred. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” earlier in this press release for additional information regarding the items excluded from income from continuing operations attributable to CVS Health and GAAP diluted EPS.

(3) The Company defines adjusted revenues as total revenues (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of certain items that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance, such as interest income on financings associated with proposed acquisitions (for periods prior to the acquisition) and any other items specifically identified herein. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” earlier in this press release for additional information regarding the items excluded from total revenues.

(4) The Company defines adjusted operating expenses as operating expenses (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance, such as acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, store rationalization charges, gains/losses on divestitures, impairment of long-lived assets and any other items specifically identified herein. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” earlier in this press release for additional information regarding the items excluded from operating expenses.

(5) Enterprise prescriptions include prescriptions dispensed through the Company’s retail pharmacies, long-term care pharmacies, and mail order pharmacies as well as prescription claims managed through our pharmacy benefits manager, with an elimination for managed prescription claims filled through CVS Health dispensing channels. 

(6) Includes an adjustment to convert 90-day prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.

(7) Pharmacy network revenues, pharmacy claims processed and generic dispensing rate do not include Maintenance Choice® activity, which is included within the mail choice category. Pharmacy network is defined as claims filled at retail and specialty retail pharmacies, including the Company’s retail pharmacies and long-term care pharmacies, but excluding Maintenance Choice activity. Maintenance Choice permits eligible client plan members to fill their maintenance prescriptions through mail order delivery or at a CVS Pharmacy retail store for the same price as mail order.

(8) Mail choice is defined as claims filled at a Pharmacy Services mail order facility, which includes specialty mail claims inclusive of Specialty Connect® claims picked up at a retail pharmacy, as well as prescriptions filled at the Company’s retail pharmacies under the Maintenance Choice program.

(9) Same store sales and prescription volume exclude revenues from MinuteClinic®, and revenues and prescriptions from stores in Brazil and LTC operations.

(10) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation.
