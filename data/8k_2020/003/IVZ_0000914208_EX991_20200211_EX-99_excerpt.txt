Atlanta, February 11, 2020 --- Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management (AUM) of $1,218.7 billion, a decrease of 0.6% versus previous month-end. The decrease was driven by unfavorable market returns, net outflows in non-management fee earning AUM, and roughly equal impacts from long-term AUM net outflows and foreign exchange, which were partially offset by net inflows in money market AUM and reinvested distributions. FX decreased AUM by $1.1 billion. Preliminary average total AUM for the quarter through January 31 were $1,235.5 billion, and preliminary average active AUM for the quarter through January 31 were $933.3 billion.
