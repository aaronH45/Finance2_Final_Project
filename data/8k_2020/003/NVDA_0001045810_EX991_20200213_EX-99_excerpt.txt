Fiscal 2020 Summary

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NVIDIA’s outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 does not include any contribution from the pending acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. Discussions with China’s regulatory agency, the State Administration for Market Regulation, are progressing, and NVIDIA believes the acquisition will likely close in the early part of calendar 2020.

While the ultimate effect of the coronavirus is difficult to estimate, the company has reduced its revenue outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 by $100 million to account for its potential impact.

•Revenue is expected to be $3.00 billion, plus or minus 2 percent.

•GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.0 percent and 65.4 percent, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.

•GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.05 billion and $835 million, respectively. 

•GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million.

•GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9 percent, plus or minus 1 percent, excluding any discrete items. GAAP discrete items include excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to stock-based compensation, which are expected to generate variability on a quarter by quarter basis.

Highlights 

Since the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, NVIDIA has achieved progress in these areas:

Gaming 

•Grew momentum for ray tracing with the launch of such RTX-enabled games as Deliver Us The Moon, Wolfenstein: Youngblood and Bright Memory.

•Brought its GeForce NOW™ cloud gaming service out of beta, opening up PC gaming to hundreds of millions of consumers who can now add a virtual GeForce® graphics card to their device and play games they own, as well as free-to-play games. 

•Brought its number of gaming laptops to a record 125 models, including the world’s first 14-inch GeForce RTX™ laptop, the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14.

•Continued to build G-SYNC® momentum at CES, with the launch of the ASUS ROG Swift 360, the world’s fastest monitor, with a 360Hz refresh rate; and with LG adopting G-SYNC in its new lineup of OLED TVs. 

Data Center and Edge Computing

•Unveiled the first scalable GPU-accelerated supercomputer in the cloud with Microsoft Azure, with access to up to 800 NVIDIA® V100 Tensor Core GPUs.

•Announced that it is powering the world’s most powerful industrial supercomputer, HPC5, which has 7,280 NVIDIA V100 GPUs and is operated by Italian energy company Eni.

•Announced that Alibaba’s and Baidu’s recommendation engines run on NVIDIA AI, boosting inference by orders of magnitude beyond CPUs.

•Joined forces with AWS, using NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs to power AWS Outposts, bringing Amazon EC2 G4 instances to customers’ data centers. 

•Collaborated with Arm, Ampere Computing, Fujitsu and Marvell on a new reference design platform for GPU-accelerated Arm-based servers, and with Red Hat to bring GPU acceleration to Arm for HPC applications.

•Introduced NVIDIA TensorRT™ 7, an inference software development kit, paving the way to smarter and faster conversational AI.

•Unveiled NVIDIA Clara™ Federated Learning, a reference application that preserves patient privacy while improving global model accuracy, already in use by the American College of Radiology and UCLA Health.

•Introduced Magnum IO, a software suite for data scientists and high performance computing researchers that is optimized to eliminate storage and input/output bottlenecks.

•Released a new version of the NVIDIA Isaac™ software development kit, a unified robotic development platform to accelerate the development and testing of robots.

Professional Visualization

•Brought RTX technology to new desktops and laptops from Acer and joined forces with Adobe to provide a complimentary three-month Adobe Creative Cloud membership with new RTX Studio purchases.

•Introduced RTX capabilities to Autodesk’s Maya 2020, Dassault’s Catia 2020 and Siemens Ray-Trace Studio with the release of a new NVIDIA Quadro® Driver and NVIDIA Studio Driver.

•Expanded the reach of RTX technology into Chaos Group’s V-Ray, Autodesk’s Arnold and Blender’s Cycles, enabling designers to create complex 3D visuals, accurate reflections and more.

Automotive

•Announced DRIVE AGX Orin™, an advanced software-defined platform for autonomous vehicles capable of achieving 200 TOPS, nearly 7x that of the previous generation SoC.

CFO Commentary

Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at http://investor.nvidia.com/.

Conference Call and Webcast Information

NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2:30 p.m. Pacific time (5:30 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2021.

Non-GAAP Measures

To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related and other costs, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
