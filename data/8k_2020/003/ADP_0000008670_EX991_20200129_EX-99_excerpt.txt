ROSELAND, N.J. – January 29, 2020 – ADP (Nasdaq: ADP), a leading global technology company providing human capital management (HCM) solutions, today announced its second quarter fiscal 2020 financial results and updated its fiscal 2020 outlook.

Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Consolidated Results

Compared to last year’s second quarter, revenues increased 5% to $3.7 billion, 6% organic constant currency. Net earnings increased 17% to $652 million, and adjusted net earnings increased 12% to $658 million. Adjusted EBIT increased 9% to $854 million, representing adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 70 basis points in the quarter to 23.3%. Adjusted EBIT margin expansion was driven by continued execution of transformation initiatives as well as operating efficiencies offset by incremental sales and marketing, amortization, and PEO pass-through expenses. ADP’s effective tax rate and adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.0%. Diluted EPS increased 18% to $1.50, and adjusted diluted EPS increased 13% to $1.52 due to the factors discussed above as well as a net share count reduction.

“We are continuing to execute well as we balance near-term transformation initiatives with long-term growth investments,” said Carlos Rodriguez, President and Chief Executive Officer, ADP. “With a new decade ahead of us, we look forward to spending time with the financial community at our upcoming Innovation Day to discuss our progress on our investments in innovation, as well as our vision for our HCM technology portfolio.”

“We are pleased to see continued steady top-line growth and margin expansion as we overcame a difficult compare last year,” said Kathleen Winters, Chief Financial Officer, ADP. “We are committed to driving efficiency throughout our organization and we are proud of our progress towards simplifying the client experience.”
