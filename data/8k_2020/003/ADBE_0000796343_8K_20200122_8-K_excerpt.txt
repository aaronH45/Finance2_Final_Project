Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 

On January 22, 2020, Adobe Inc. (“Adobe”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with BofA Securities, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The Underwriting Agreement provides for the issuance and sale by Adobe of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.700% Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”), (ii) $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 1.900% Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”), (iii) $850,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 2.150% Notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”), and (iv) $1,300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 2.300% Notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes,” and, together with the 2023 Notes, the 2025 Notes and the 2027 Notes, the “Notes”). 

The Notes were issued and sold in a public offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-229364) (the “Registration Statement”) filed on January 25, 2019, a related preliminary prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 22, 2020, and a related final prospectus supplement filed on January 24, 2020. The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by Adobe, and customary closing conditions, indemnification rights and termination provisions. 

The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be approximately $3.1 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. Adobe intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which, among other things, will include repaying the $900.0 million in outstanding aggregate principal amount of Adobe’s 4.750% senior notes due 2020, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and its $2.25 billion unsecured term loan. 

The above description of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 8.01 Other Events. 

Hogan Lovells US LLP, counsel to Adobe, has issued an opinion to Adobe dated January 22, 2020 regarding the legality of the Notes. A copy of the opinion is filed as Exhibit 5.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
