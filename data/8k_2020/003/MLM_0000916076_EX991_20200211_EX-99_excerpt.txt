Ward Nye, Chairman, President and CEO of Martin Marietta, stated, “We are pleased to have concluded 2019 as the most profitable year in our Company’s history. Driven by improved shipments, pricing and profitability across the vast majority of our Building Materials business, we achieved our eighth consecutive year of growth for revenues, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per diluted share (after adjusting for the one-time earnings per diluted share benefit in 2017 from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017). This year’s record-setting results, combined with our team’s shared commitment to safety and operational excellence, yielded a 64 percent total shareholder return. Building on this momentum and our more than 25-year history as a public company, Martin Marietta is well-positioned for responsible long-term growth and further shareholder value creation in 2020 and beyond.  

“Looking ahead, our 2020 outlook remains positive across our three primary construction end-use markets. We believe construction growth in Martin Marietta’s top ten states will continue to outpace national averages and serves to reinforce our positive pricing outlook. Further supported by attractive market fundamentals and demand trends across our geographic footprint, as well as region-specific third-party forecasts, we expect the current construction cycle to expand at a steady and sustainable pace. Specifically, we anticipate infrastructure shipments, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways and streets, to meaningfully benefit from lettings and contract awards in our key states, strong federal and state funding levels and proposed regulatory reform. We are confident that states have the necessary visibility and resources to advance planned and future construction projects, regardless of a successor infrastructure bill passing prior to the September 2020 expiration of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act). Furthermore, the Council on Environmental Quality recently proposed recommendations that, if approved, will reduce the regulatory burden of permitting large highway and bridge projects.” 

Mr. Nye concluded, “With enhanced levels of needed infrastructure activity on the horizon and a healthy private sector, we expect 2020 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. Our ability to repeatedly deliver industry-leading safety, financial and operational performance demonstrates the successful execution of our proven strategy and our steadfast dedication to the world-class attributes of our business – including, safety, ethics, cost discipline and operational excellence. Importantly, we continue to strengthen this foundation for long-term success through strategic geographic positioning, cost management, price discipline, sustainable practices and prudent capital allocation. We will continue adhering to our strategic priorities and look forward to extending our long track record of consistently delivering profitability growth and enhanced shareholder value.”

Fourth-Quarter Operating Results 

(All comparisons are versus the prior-year quarter unless noted otherwise) 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Building Materials Business 

Fourth-quarter operating results reflect the continuation of strong underlying product demand, partially offset by the timing of infrastructure projects. The aggregates and downstream operations in Colorado, the Company’s second-largest state by revenues, experienced project delays resulting from significant precipitation and extreme temperatures along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains and unplanned maintenance and repair activities. 

Aggregates  

Fourth-quarter aggregates shipments and pricing improved 4.0 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively. 

♦  

Shipments for the Mid-America Group increased 3.5 percent, driven primarily by wind energy and data center projects in the Midwest. Lower infrastructure shipments and unfavorable product mix limited pricing growth to 1.0 percent.  

♦  

Shipments for the Southeast Group increased 7.5 percent, reflecting strong private-sector construction activity in the North Georgia and Florida markets that was partially tempered by infrastructure project delays. Pricing improved 3.0 percent. 

♦  

West Group shipments increased 3.4 percent, driven by strong underlying Texas demand that was offset by Colorado’s weather-impacted construction delays and unanticipated operating downtime. Pricing growth of 12.9 percent reflected favorable product mix and a higher percentage of commercial rail-shipped volumes.  

Martin Marietta’s fourth-quarter aggregates shipments by end use are as follows (all comparisons are versus the prior-year quarter):  

Infrastructure Market 

♦  

Aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market decreased modestly, reflecting project delays in North Carolina, Georgia and Colorado. The infrastructure market accounted for 34 percent of fourth-quarter aggregates shipments. For the full year, the infrastructure market represented 35 percent of aggregates shipments, remaining below the Company’s most recent ten-year average of 45 percent.  

Nonresidential Market 

♦  

Aggregates shipments to the nonresidential market increased, driven by ongoing commercial and heavy industrial construction activity. The Company continued to benefit from distribution center, warehouse, data center and wind energy projects in key geographies, including Texas, the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and Iowa, as well as the early phases of several large energy-sector projects along the Gulf Coast. The nonresidential market represented 37 percent of fourth-quarter aggregates shipments.  

Residential Market 

♦  

Aggregates shipments to the residential market increased, driven by a continued and attractive homebuilding dynamic in Texas, the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida. The residential construction outlook across the Company’s geographic footprint remains positive for both single- and multi-family housing, driven by favorable population demographics, job growth, land availability, low interest rates and efficient permitting. On a national level, housing starts remain below the 50-year annual average of 1.5 million despite notable population gains. The residential market accounted for 23 percent of fourth-quarter aggregates shipments.

ChemRock/Rail Market 

♦  

The ChemRock/Rail market accounted for the remaining 6 percent of fourth-quarter aggregates shipments. Volumes to this end use increased, driven by improved ballast shipments as the western Class 1 railroads continued to address repairs from the Midwest flooding earlier in the year.  

Aggregates product gross margin expanded 170 basis points to 27.0 percent, driven by pricing gains and improved operating leverage from increased shipment and production levels and was partially offset by higher costs for contract services, repairs and supplies to prepare for future production needs. 

Cement 

Fourth-quarter cement shipments increased 22.3 percent, driven by strong underlying Texas demand. Unfavorable product mix muted pricing gains to 2.2 percent. Revenue growth, coupled with production efficiencies from increased shipment and production levels, more than offset higher maintenance costs, as product gross margin improved 320 basis points to 36.0 percent.  

Downstream businesses 

Ready mixed concrete shipments increased 5.3 percent, reflecting the healthy Texas demand environment, partially offset by weather-impacted projects in Colorado. Ready mixed concrete selling prices declined slightly, as unfavorable product mix and a shift in customer segmentation affected Texas pricing and offset solid pricing gains in Colorado. Colorado asphalt shipments decreased 4.1 percent while pricing improved 1.8 percent.  

Magnesia Specialties Business 

Magnesia Specialties product revenues decreased 24.1 percent to $51.0 million as international chemicals and domestic lime customers continued to rationalize inventory levels. The business reported product gross margin of 38.5 percent, as effective cost containment measures limited the decline to 40 basis points.  

Consolidated 

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues declined 30 basis points. 

Other operating expense, net, for the prior-year quarter included an $11.7 million asset and portfolio rationalization charge related to the Company’s Southwest ready mixed concrete business. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash provided by operating activities was $966.1 million in 2019 compared with $705.1 million in 2018, driven by growth in earnings and lower contributions to the Company’s pension plan, partially offset by higher working capital related to increased revenues. 

Cash paid for property, plant and equipment additions was $393.5 million in 2019.

Commitment to Enhance Long-Term Shareholder Value 

Martin Marietta is dedicated to disciplined capital allocation that preserves the Company’s financial flexibility and further enhances shareholder value. The Company’s capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and include value-enhancing acquisitions that promote the successful execution of the Company’s strategic growth plan, organic capital investment, and the return of cash to shareholders through meaningful and sustainable dividends and share repurchases. 

The Company has returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividend payments and share repurchases since announcing a 20 million share repurchase authorization in February 2015. During fourth quarter 2019, the Company repurchased 154,500 shares of common stock pursuant to its share repurchase authorization. As of December 31, 2019, 13.7 million shares remained under the current repurchase authorization and 62.4 million shares of Martin Marietta common stock were outstanding.  

Full-Year 2020 Outlook 

Martin Marietta is confident in its 2020 outlook and in its key supporting factors. The Company’s geographic footprint has attractive underlying market fundamentals, including notable employment gains, population growth and superior state fiscal health, that should promote steady and sustainable construction growth over the near- and medium-terms. Supported by region-specific third-party forecasts and underlying demand trends, Martin Marietta believes the current construction cycle will continue for the foreseeable future and expand at a steady pace in 2020 for each of its three primary construction end-use markets. Notably: 

♦  

Infrastructure construction, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways and streets, is expected to benefit from lettings and contract awards in key Martin Marietta states, continued FAST Act funding, and regulatory reform allowing for reduced permitting time for large projects. Management believes that federal transportation funding will remain, at a minimum, at status quo levels absent the prospective passage of a successor infrastructure bill prior to the FAST Act’s September 2020 expiration. This should provide the necessary confidence and visibility for states to continue to advance planned and future construction projects. Importantly, states will continue to play an expanded role in infrastructure investment. Incremental funding at both state and local levels, through bond issuances, toll roads, tax initiatives and other sources, should grow at faster near-term rates than federal funding. Martin Marietta’s top ten states – Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa, Florida, South Carolina, Indiana, Maryland and Nebraska – accounted for 86 percent of total Building Materials’ revenues in 2019 and have all introduced incremental transportation funding measures within the last five years. Third-party forecasts also predict increased infrastructure investment in 2020 and beyond. 

♦  

Nonresidential construction is expected to increase in both the commercial and heavy industrial sectors for the next several years across many of the Company’s key markets. The national Architectural Billings and Dodge Momentum Indices have both rebounded from 2019 fluctuations and suggest healthy activity in Martin Marietta markets. Further, management believes continued employment and population growth will drive increased levels of commercial construction activity, particularly in the Company’s southeastern and southwestern states. Continued federal regulatory approvals should contribute to increased heavy building materials consumption from the next wave of large energy-sector projects, particularly along the Gulf Coast of Texas. Construction activity for these projects is expected to continue for several years.
