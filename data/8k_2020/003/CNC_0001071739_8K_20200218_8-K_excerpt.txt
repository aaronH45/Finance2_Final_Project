ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS

Kenneth Burdick, Executive Vice President of Markets and Products of Centene Corporation ("Centene" or the "Company") and former Chief Executive Officer of WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (“WellCare”), and Centene negotiated a two year employment agreement whereby Mr. Burdick would support the Company during the WellCare integration. In recent discussions with Mr. Burdick, the Company has agreed to a one year term, provided that Mr. Burdick make himself available to consult for the Company for one year subsequent to his retirement on February 21, 2021. 

Mr. Burdick, in preparation for his planned retirement, entered into a 10b5-1 trading plan on February 18, 2020 to monetize a portion of his shares of Centene common stock. Rule 10b5-1 allows officers and directors, at a time when they are not in possession of material nonpublic information, to adopt written plans to sell shares on a regular basis under pre-arranged terms, regardless of any subsequent nonpublic information they may receive. Importantly, Mr. Burdick is selling only a portion of his shares pursuant to this plan and is expected to maintain significant ownership at his retirement.

Sales of common stock by Mr. Burdick pursuant to the terms of the plan, or otherwise, will be disclosed publicly through Form 144, if applicable and any required Form 4 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

SIGNATURE
