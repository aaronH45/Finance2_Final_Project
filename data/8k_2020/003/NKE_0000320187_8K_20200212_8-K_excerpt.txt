Ms. O’Neill succeeds Elliott Hill, who notified the Company on February 12, 2020 of his intention to retire from his position as President of Consumer and Marketplace effective March 31, 2020. Mr. Campion succeeds Eric Sprunk, who notified the Company on February 12, 2020 of his intention to retire from his position as COO effective March 31, 2020. Mr. Hill and Mr. Sprunk are expected to retire from NIKE by the end of calendar year 2020.

Pursuant to their noncompetition agreements, the Company will make monthly payments to each of them during the one-year noncompetition period, each in an amount equal to one-twelfth of his annual base salary.

Mr. Campion, 48, joined NIKE in 2007 as Vice President of Global Planning and Development, leading long-range financial and strategic planning, and was appointed Chief Financial Officer of the NIKE Brand in 2010.

In connection with Mr. Friend’s appointment as NIKE’s CFO, he will receive an annual base salary of $875,000, a target annual bonus opportunity of 120% of his annual base salary, and a target annual long-term cash incentive award opportunity of $1,000,000 commencing with the fiscal 2018-2020 performance period. He will also receive a special transition award of RSUs with a grant date fair value of $6,000,000 that will vest ratably over four years. 

In addition, as part of standard compensation and benefit arrangements for senior executives, Mr. Friend and the Company have entered into a noncompetition agreement (the “Non-Compete Agreement”) that applies for one year following Mr. Friend’s termination of employment with the Company. The Non-Compete Agreement provides that, if Mr. Friend’s employment is terminated by NIKE without cause (as defined in the Non-Compete Agreement), the Company will make monthly payments to him during the one-year noncompetition period, each in an amount equal to one-twelfth of his annual base salary; if Mr. Friend resigns, the Company will make monthly payments to him during the one-year noncompetition period, each in an amount equal to one-twenty fourth of his annual base salary. NIKE may unilaterally waive Mr. Friend’s non-compete obligations set forth in the Non-Compete Agreement, in which case NIKE will not be required to make the payments described in the preceding sentence during the period as to which the waiver applies.
