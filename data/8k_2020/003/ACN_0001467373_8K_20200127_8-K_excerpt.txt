Item 8.01 Other Events

Accenture plc (“Accenture”) has received notice of an unsolicited “mini-tender” offer by TRC Capital Investment Corporation (“TRC Capital”) to purchase up to 750,000 Class A ordinary shares of Accenture at an offer price of $199.38 per share in cash, which is approximately 4.41 percent lower than the $208.57 per share closing price for Accenture’s Class A ordinary shares on January 24, 2020, the last trading day before the commencement of TRC Capital’s mini-tender offer. The Class A ordinary shares subject to TRC Capital’s offer represent approximately 0.12 percent of the shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock as of the date of the offer. 

Accenture does not endorse TRC Capital’s unsolicited mini-tender offer and is not associated in any way with TRC Capital, its mini-tender offer, or its mini-tender offer documents. 

On January 29, 2020, Accenture issued the news release attached to this Report as Exhibit 99, informing its shareholders that Accenture does not endorse TRC Capital’s unsolicited mini-tender offer and recommending that shareholders not tender their shares to TRC Capital. Shareholders who have already tendered their shares may withdraw them at any time prior to the expiration of the offer, in accordance with TRC Capital’s offering documents. TRC Capital’s offer is currently scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, February 26, 2020, unless the offer is otherwise extended by TRC Capital in its discretion or terminated earlier. 

Additional information concerning mini-tender offers is included, or referred to, in the attached news release.
