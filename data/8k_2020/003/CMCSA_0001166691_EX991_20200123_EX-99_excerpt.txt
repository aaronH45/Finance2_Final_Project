Notes:

1We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. 

2All earnings per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. 

3In first quarter 2019, we changed our presentation of Adjusted EPS to also exclude amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets. Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as our diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders adjusted to exclude the effects of the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, investments that investors may want to evaluate separately (such as based on fair value) and the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that affect period-over-period comparisons. See Table 5 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. 

4We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets. From time to time, we may exclude from Free Cash Flow the impact of certain cash receipts or payments (such as significant legal settlements) that affect period-to-period comparability. Cash payments for acquisitions and construction of real estate properties and the construction of Universal Beijing Resort are presented separately in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and are therefore excluded from capital expenditures for Free Cash Flow. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. 

5Consolidated financial results include Sky results for periods following the acquisition on October 9, 2018. 

6Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, Comcast Cable's wireless phone service and certain other Cable-related business development initiatives are now presented in the Cable Communications segment. Results were previously presented in Corporate and Other. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. To be consistent with our current management reporting presentation, certain 2018 operating results were reclassified related to certain NBCUniversal businesses now presented in the Sky segment.  

7Sky constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the current period results to the comparative period results in the prior year adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective prior year periods. See Table 8 for reconciliation of Sky's constant currency growth.  

All percentages are calculated on whole numbers. Minor differences may exist due to rounding.
