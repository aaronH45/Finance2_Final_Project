Item 8.01. Other Events.  

On February 24, 2020, AbbVie Inc. (“AbbVie”) issued a press release announcing that it has extended the expiration date of its previously announced (i) offers to exchange (each, an “Exchange Offer” and, collectively, the “Exchange Offers”) any and all outstanding notes of certain series issued by Allergan Finance, LLC (“Allergan Finance”), Allergan, Inc. (“Allergan Inc”), Allergan Sales, LLC (“Allergan Sales”) and Allergan Funding SCS (“Allergan Funding” and, together with Allergan Finance, Allergan Inc and Allergan Sales, “Allergan”) (the “Allergan Notes”) for new notes to be issued by AbbVie (the “AbbVie Notes”) and (ii) related consent solicitations (each, a “Consent Solicitation” and, collectively, the “Consent Solicitations”) being made by AbbVie on behalf of Allergan to adopt certain amendments (the “Amendments”) to eliminate substantially all of the covenants, restrictive provisions, events of default and any guarantees of the related Allergan Notes in each of the indentures governing the Allergan Notes. 

AbbVie extended such expiration date from 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 28, 2020 to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 13, 2020 (as the same may be further extended, the “Expiration Date”). 

The Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations were commenced in connection with AbbVie’s proposed acquisition of Allergan plc (the “Acquisition”) and are being made pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the confidential offering memorandum and consent solicitation statement, dated October 25, 2019, and the related letter of transmittal, each as amended by the press releases dated November 18, 2019, December 20, 2019 and January 27, 2020 and the attached press release. The Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations are conditioned upon the consummation of the Acquisition, which condition may not be waived by AbbVie, and certain other conditions that may be waived by AbbVie. 

The settlement date of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations is expected to occur promptly after the Expiration Date and the Expiration Date of each of the Exchange Offers is expected to be extended to occur on or about the closing date of the Acquisition. As a result, the Expiration Date may be further extended one or more times. AbbVie currently anticipates providing notice of any such extension in advance of the Expiration Date. 

Supplemental indentures effecting the Amendments were executed on November 7, 2019. Such supplemental indentures will become operative only upon settlement of the Exchange Offers. 

The AbbVie Notes offered in the Exchange Offers have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws. Therefore, the AbbVie Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any applicable state securities laws. 

A copy of the press release issued by AbbVie is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.
