 Item 1.01  

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.   

On January 28, 2020, Biogen Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and the L/C Issuer, and the lenders party thereto (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.0 billion five-year unsecured, revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility includes borrowing capacity in the form of letters of credit of up to $25.0 million.  

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other lawful corporate purposes. No proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility were drawn down as of the closing date of the Credit Agreement.  

Revolving loans under the Credit Agreement (other than swing line loans) will bear interest at rate per annum equal to a Eurocurrency Rate – for dollars, euros, sterling and yen, the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or for any other currency approved pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, at the rate designated at the time of such approval, in each case subject to a floor of 0.00% per annum, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.750% to 1.375% depending on the ratings of the Company’s non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt, as determined by either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s (the “Debt Ratings”) or, at the Company’s option, a Base Rate equal to the higher of (i) the Bank of America prime rate, (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% and (iii) a daily rate equal to one month LIBOR plus 1.00%, subject to a floor of 0.00% per annum (the “Base Rate”), plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.000% to 0.375% based on the Company’s Debt Ratings. Swing line loans will bear interest at the Base Rate plus the applicable margin for Base Rate loans.  

In addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company will pay (i) a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder and (ii) customary letter of credit fees and agency fees. The commitment fees range from 0.050% to 0.175% per annum based on the Company’s Debt Ratings.  

The Revolving Credit Facility will terminate and all amounts outstanding thereunder are due and payable five years after the closing date, subject to certain extension options as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, voluntary prepayments are permitted, in whole or in part, in minimum amounts without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to Eurocurrency borrowings. The Revolving Credit Facility requires quarterly interest payments or, in the case of Eurocurrency borrowings, at the end of the interest period therefor, with the principal due on the maturity date.  

The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The Credit Agreement also includes a financial covenant requiring the Company to maintain, measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0 (which may be temporarily increased to 4.0 to 1.0 upon the election of the Company as a result of a material acquisition, subject to customary limitations).  

A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The description of the Credit Agreement is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Credit Agreement.  

 Item 1.02  

Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.   

Simultaneously with the Company’s entry into the Credit Agreement, it repaid in full all outstanding obligations under, and terminated, its existing Credit Agreement, dated as of August 28, 2015 (the “Existing Credit Agreement”), among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and an L/C issuer, and the lenders party thereto. No loans were outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement at the time of termination. The material terms and conditions of the Existing Credit Agreement were described in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 1, 2015, and such description is incorporated herein by reference.
