In Heart Failure, double-digit growth was driven by market adoption of Abbott's HeartMate 3® left ventricular assist device, which has been shown to improve survival and clinical outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure. 

Growth in Structural Heart was led by MitraClip®, Abbott’s market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation, or a leaky mitral heart valve.

1 Fourth-quarter 2019 diluted EPS from continuing operations on a GAAP basis reflects 59.5 percent growth. 

2 Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict the impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could significantly impact reported sales growth.
