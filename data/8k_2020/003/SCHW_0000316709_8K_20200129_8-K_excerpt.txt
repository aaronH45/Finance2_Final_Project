Item 8.01 Other Events 

As previously disclosed, on November 24, 2019, The Charles Schwab Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Schwab”) and TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“TD Ameritrade”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, a wholly owned subsidiary of Schwab will be merged with and into TD Ameritrade (the “Merger”), with TD Ameritrade continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Schwab. 

The Merger is conditioned on the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”). Pursuant to the HSR Act, on January 29, 2020, TD Ameritrade and Schwab each received a request for additional information and documentary material, often referred to as a “second request,” from the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”). Issuance of the second request extends the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act until 30 days after TD Ameritrade and Schwab have substantially complied with the second request, unless the period for review is extended voluntarily by the parties and the DOJ or is terminated earlier by the DOJ. TD Ameritrade and Schwab have and will continue to cooperate fully with the DOJ in its review. The parties continue to expect that all required regulatory approvals for the Merger will be obtained and that the Merger will be completed in the second half of 2020. Schwab intends to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a registration statement on Form S-4 that will include a joint proxy statement of Schwab and TD Ameritrade soon after Schwab files its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. 

Important Information About the Transaction and Where to Find it  

In connection with the proposed transaction between Schwab and TD Ameritrade, Schwab and TD Ameritrade will file relevant materials with the SEC, including a Schwab registration statement on Form S-4 that will include a joint proxy statement of Schwab and TD Ameritrade that also constitutes a prospectus of Schwab, and a definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus will be mailed to stockholders of Schwab and TD Ameritrade. INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF SCHWAB AND TD AMERITRADE ARE URGED TO READ THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT, THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS THAT ARE FILED OR WILL BE FILED WITH THE SEC, AS WELL AS ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS TO THESE DOCUMENTS, CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN OR WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION AND RELATED MATTERS. Investors and security holders may obtain free copies of the registration statement and the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Schwab or TD Ameritrade through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov or by contacting the investor relations department of Schwab or TD Ameritrade at the following:
