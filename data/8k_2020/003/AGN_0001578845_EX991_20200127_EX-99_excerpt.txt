PRESS RELEASE  

AbbVie and Allergan Announce Agreements to Divest Brazikumab and Zenpep  

Agreements Contingent on FTC and European Commission Approval and Completion of AbbVie’s Pending Acquisition of Allergan  

NORTH CHICAGO, Ill. and DUBLIN, Jan. 27, 2020 – AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), a research-based global biopharmaceutical company, and Allergan (NYSE: AGN), a leading global pharmaceutical company, today announced that Allergan has entered into definitive agreements to divest brazikumab (IL-23 inhibitor) and Zenpep (pancrelipase). These agreements are in conjunction with the ongoing regulatory approval process for AbbVie’s acquisition of Allergan.  

AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN) will acquire brazikumab, an investigational IL-23 inhibitor in Phase 2b/3 development for Crohn’s Disease and in Phase 2 development for ulcerative colitis, including global development and commercial rights.  

Nestle (Swiss: NESN) will acquire and take full operational ownership of Zenpep upon closing the transaction with customary transition support from Allergan. Zenpep is a treatment, which is available in the United States, for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis and other conditions. Nestle also will be acquiring Viokace, another pancreatic enzyme preparation, as part of the same transaction.  

“These definitive agreements represent significant progress toward the completion of our acquisition of Allergan,” said Richard A. Gonzalez, chairman and chief executive officer, AbbVie. “The new combined organization will be well positioned to deliver on our mission to patients with a broad portfolio of innovative therapies.”  

“Today, we move another step closer to completing AbbVie’s acquisition of Allergan. Allergan’s commercial and R&D teams have invested so much of themselves into the development of brazikumab and the commercialization of Zenpep, and these divestiture agreements will enable that work to continue following the close of our planned acquisition,” said Brent Saunders, chairman and chief executive officer of Allergan.

The closings of the acquisitions of brazikumab and Zenpep are contingent upon receipt of U.S. Federal Trade Commission and European Commission approval, closing of AbbVie’s pending acquisition of Allergan and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.  

On January 10, 2020, AbbVie and Allergan received conditional approval of the transaction by the European Commission, subject to the approved divestiture of brazikumab and other conditions.  

AbbVie and Allergan continue to expect a first-quarter 2020 close of their pending transaction, subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.

About Zenpep  

ZENPEP® (pancrelipase) is a prescription medication for people who cannot digest food normally because their pancreas does not make enough enzymes. ZENPEP may help your body use fats, proteins, and sugars from food. ZENPEP contains a mixture of digestive enzymes (lipases, proteases, and amylases) from pig pancreas. In clinical studies, individuals with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency associated with cystic fibrosis absorbed more fat from foods than those treated with a placebo.  

About Brazikumab  

Brazikumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the IL23 receptor and is in development for Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis with a companion biomarker. Brazikumab selectively blocks the IL23 immune signal, preventing intestinal inflammation. The Phase IIb/III INTREPID program is underway to assess brazikumab compared to placebo or adalimumab in Crohn’s Disease. The Phase II EXPEDITION trial is underway to assess brazikumab compared to placebo or vedolizumab in Ulcerative Colitis.
