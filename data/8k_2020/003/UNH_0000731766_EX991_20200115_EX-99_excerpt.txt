•UnitedHealth Group’s full year 2019 revenues of $242.2 billion grew $15.9 billion or 7.0 percent year-over-year, reflecting balanced, broad-based revenue growth across the businesses. 

•Full year 2019 earnings from operations grew $2.3 billion or 13.5 percent year-over-year to $19.7 billion, with both UnitedHealthcare and Optum contributing strongly.

•Cash flows from operations in 2019 of $18.5 billion, or 1.3 times net income, grew 17.5 percent year-over-year. Fourth quarter cash flows were stronger than anticipated, partly on timing factors.

•The full year 2019 medical care ratio of 82.5 percent increased from 81.6 percent in 2018, as the impact of the health insurance tax deferral was partially offset by improved medical cost-efficiency. Favorable medical reserve development was $270 million in the quarter, with $150 million related to 2019 and $120 million related to previous years. Year end days claims payable were 50.8 days compared to 49.3 days in the third quarter 2019 and 49.5 in the fourth quarter 2018.

•The full year 2019 operating cost ratio of 14.5 percent declined from 15.1 percent in 2018, as the health insurance tax deferral and operating efficiencies were partially offset by business mix changes and investments in service, innovation and growth. 

•Return on equity of 25.7 percent in 2019 reflected the Company’s strong overall operating performance and efficient capital structure. The debt to total capital ratio was 40.2 percent at December 31, 2019, full year dividend payments grew 18.4 percent year-over-year to $3.9 billion, and the Company repurchased 22.4 million shares for $5.5 billion in 2019.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE

(in millions, except per share data)

(unaudited)

ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE(a) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Adjusted net earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

Adjusted net earnings per share excludes from the relevant GAAP metric, as applicable, intangible amortization and other items, if any, that do not relate to the Company's underlying business performance. Management believes that the use of adjusted net earnings per share provides investors and management useful information about the earnings impact of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. As amortization fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity, management believes this exclusion provides a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance and trends from period to period. While intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the intangible amortization is not directly related. Therefore, the related revenues are included in adjusted earnings per share.
