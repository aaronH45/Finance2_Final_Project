Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

On January 30, 2020, Accenture plc (“Accenture”) held its 2020 annual general meeting of shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”). At the Annual Meeting, Accenture’s shareholders approved an amendment and restatement of the Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Share Incentive Plan (such restatement, the “Amended 2010 SIP”), which had previously been approved by the Board of Directors of Accenture (the “Board”), subject to shareholder approval. 

The Amended 2010 SIP is substantially the same as the prior Amended and Restated Accenture plc 2010 Share Incentive Plan, except that it has been amended to (i) authorize an additional 15 million shares, (ii) extend the term of the plan until December 9, 2029, (iii) formalize Accenture’s historical practice that accrued dividends and dividend equivalent rights may not be paid out unless and until the underlying award vests, (iv) add a minimum vesting period of one year from grant for all options granted under the plan and (v) reiterate that Accenture’s clawback policies apply to all awards granted under the plan. 

The material terms of the Amended 2010 SIP are described in Accenture’s definitive proxy statement for the Annual Meeting filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 10, 2019 (the “Proxy Statement”), and the description of the plan included in the Proxy Statement is incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 99.1. The description of the Amended 2010 SIP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended 2010 SIP, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto.
