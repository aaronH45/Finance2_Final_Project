Mr. Khani has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for CONSOL Energy Inc. (publicly owned producer and exporter of high-BTU bituminous thermal coal) since March 2013, initially overseeing the company’s combined natural gas and coal businesses prior to the spin-off of CONSOL Energy Inc. from CNX Resources Corporation in November 2017, and most recently overseeing the coal operations of CONSOL Energy Inc. following the spin-off. Additionally, Mr. Khani has served on the board of Consol Coal Resources LP (a master limited partnership sponsored by CONSOL Energy Inc. and formerly known as CNX Coal Resources LP) since July 2015 and as its Chief Financial Officer since August 2017. Previously, Mr, Khani served as Chief Financial Officer and a member of the board of CONE Midstream Partners, LP (a master limited partnership, now known as CNX Midstream Partners LP, that owns, operates and develops gathering and other midstream energy assets to service natural gas production in the Marcellus) from September 2014 through January 2018. Mr. Khani holds a bachelor’s degree in biology from Binghamton University and a master’s degree in business administration from the University of Rochester Simon Business School and is a Chartered Financial Analyst. 

Pursuant to the Company’s offer letter dated December 18, 2019 (the Offer Letter), Mr. Khani will: (i) have an annual base salary of $540,000; (ii) be eligible to participate in the Company’s Short-Term Incentive Plan (with a short-term incentive target for 2020 equal to 100% of the midpoint for his position, prorated based on full months worked during 2020); (iii) receive a 2020 long-term incentive award on the same terms as other executive officers of the Company, which will be governed by the terms of the Company’s 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan, with a total value of $2,500,000 determined on a basis consistent with the Company’s practice; and (iv) receive a signing bonus consisting of $2,000,000 in cash, subject to a requirement that he repay the signing bonus in the event of a termination of employment within one year under certain circumstances as specified in the Offer Letter. 

The description of Mr. Khani’s Offer Letter set forth above is not complete, and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of such letter, a copy of which is filed herewith as an exhibit and the terms of which are incorporated by reference.
