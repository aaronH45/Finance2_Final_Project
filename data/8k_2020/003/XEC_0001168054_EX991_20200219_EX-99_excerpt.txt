DENVER, February 19, 2020 - Cimarex Energy Co. (NYSE: XEC) today reported a net loss for fourth quarter 2019 of $384.1 million, or $3.87 per share, compared to net income of $316.2 million, or $3.32 per share, in the same period a year ago.

Both fourth quarter and full year results were negatively impacted by a non-cash charge related to the impairment of oil and gas properties. Fourth quarter 2019 adjusted net income (non-GAAP) was $120.4 million, or $1.18 per share, compared to adjusted net income (non-GAAP) of $192.1 million, or $2.01 per share in the same period a year ago1.

Adjusted cash flow from operations (non-GAAP) was $416.0 million in fourth quarter 2019 compared to $428.2 million in the same period a year ago1. Full year 2019 adjusted cash flow from operations (non-GAAP) was $1.46 billion compared to $1.53 billion in 20181. 

Oil volumes in the fourth quarter were sequentially higher, averaging 92.0 thousand barrels (MBbls) per day. For the full year, Cimarex reported average daily oil volumes of 86.2 MBbls, a 27 percent year-over-year increase.

Realized natural gas prices averaged $1.19 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), down 45 percent from the fourth quarter 2018 average of $2.16 per Mcf. NGL prices averaged $14.13 per barrel, down 32 percent from the $20.71 per barrel received in the fourth quarter of 2018, but up 31 percent from the lows we saw in the third quarter of 2019.

Both oil and natural gas prices were negatively impacted by local price differentials in 2019 although oil price differential did see some improvement year-over-year. Our realized Permian oil differential to WTI Cushing averaged $(4.48) per barrel in 2019 compared to $(9.82) in 2018. For the year, Cimarex's average differential on its Permian natural gas production was $(2.14) per Mcf compared to the Henry Hub index and, in the 

Mid-Continent region, realized gas prices differentials were $(0.68) per Mcf compared to Henry Hub. 

Cimarex invested a total of $1.32 billion in 2019, which included $944 million attributable to drilling and completion (D&C) activities, $75 million to saltwater disposal and $74 million to midstream and other investments. Capital investments were funded with cash flow from operations. 

Proved reserves at December 31, 2019 totaled 620 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE), up five percent year over year. Oil reserves increased 16 percent. Cimarex added 119 MMBOE through extensions and discoveries and 3.5 MMBOE through net performance revisions resulting in reserve replacement of 121 percent of 2019 production. Proved reserves are 86 percent proved developed.

Total debt at December 31, 2019 consisted of $2.0 billion of long-term notes. Cimarex had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility and a cash balance of $94.7 million at year-end. Debt was 37 percent of total capitalization2.

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED NET INCOME

The following reconciles net (loss) income as reported under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to adjusted net income (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Cimarex reported an impairment of oil and gas properties of $108.9 million in the third quarter 2019; however, no impairment should have been recorded in the third quarter. As such, that impairment was reversed and is now included in the impairment of oil and gas properties of $618.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter 2019. 

Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the noted items because management believes these items affect the comparability of operating results. The company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures as a useful adjunct to GAAP measures because:

a)Management uses adjusted net income to evaluate the company's operating performance between periods and to compare the company's performance to other oil and gas exploration and production companies.

b)Adjusted net income is more comparable to earnings estimates provided by research analysts.

* Does not include adjustments resulting from application of the "two-class method" used to determine earnings per share under GAAP.

** Reflects the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period as adjusted for the dilutive effects of outstanding stock options.

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, FREE CASH FLOW AND 

FREE CASH FLOW AFTER DIVIDEND

The following table provides a reconciliation from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures of net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted cash flows from operations (non-GAAP) , free cash flow (non-GAAP) and free cash flow after dividend (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Management uses the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted cash flow from operations, free cash flow and free cash flow aver dividend as means of measuring our ability to fund our capital program and dividends, without fluctuations caused by changes in current assets and liabilities, which are included in the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors for the same reason, and that they are also used by professional research analysts in providing investment recommendations pertaining to companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry.

PROVED RESERVES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

8

* Pre-tax PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV-10 is comparable to the standardized measure, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV-10 is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure but without deducting future income taxes. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Cimarex's discounted future income taxes were $319.4 million and $724.0 million, respectively. Cimarex's standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was $3,629.0 million at year-end 2019 and $4,015.2 million at year-end 2018. Management uses pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the value of the company's proved reserves and to compare relative values of proved reserves to other exploration and production companies without regard to income taxes. Management believes pre-tax PV-10 is a useful measure for comparison of proved reserve values among companies because, unlike standardized measure, it excludes future income taxes that often depend on the unique income tax characteristics of the owner of the reserves rather than on the nature, location and quality of the reserves themselves. Management further believes that professional research analysts and rating agencies use pre-tax PV-10 in similar ways. However, pre-tax PV-10 is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. Cimarex's pre-tax PV-10 and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of its oil and natural gas reserves.
