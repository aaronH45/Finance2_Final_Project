HOUSTON - EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) today reported fourth quarter 2019 net income of $637 million, or $1.10 per share, compared with fourth quarter 2018 net income of $893 million, or $1.54 per share. Net cash from operating activities for the fourth quarter 2019 was $1.8 billion. For the full year 2019, EOG reported net income of $2.7 billion, or $4.71 per share, compared with net income of $3.4 billion, or $5.89 per share, for the full year 2018. Net cash from operating activities for the full year 2019 was $8.2 billion. 

Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter 2019 was $787 million, or $1.35 per share, compared with adjusted non-GAAP net income of $718 million, or $1.24 per share, for the same prior year period. Adjusted non-GAAP net income for the full year 2019 was $2.9 billion, or $4.98 per share, compared with adjusted non-GAAP net income of $3.2 billion, or $5.54 per share, for the full year 2018. 

Increased crude oil production from high-return operating areas and reductions in per-unit operating costs contributed to EOG’s strong fourth quarter 2019 financial results. Adjusted earnings per share, discretionary cash flow and adjusted EBITDAX increased in the fourth quarter 2019 compared with the same prior year period, demonstrating EOG’s resiliency and ability to overcome declines in commodity prices. Please refer to the attached tables for definitions and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Operating Review

Capital efficiency improvements from increased well productivity and cost reductions across EOG’s premium plays supported strong operating and financial performance in 2019. United States crude oil volumes grew 15 percent to 455,500 barrels of oil per day (Bopd). Total company natural gas liquids production increased 16 percent, while total company natural gas volumes grew 12 percent.

Total crude oil volumes in the fourth quarter 2019 were 468,900 Bopd, which was above the midpoint of the target range and represents an eight percent increase compared with the same prior year period. Natural gas liquids and natural gas volumes increased by 17 percent and 15 percent, respectively, during this same period. EOG incurred total expenditures of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Total cash capital expenditures before acquisitions of $1.4 billion were below the low end of the target range. Please refer to the attached tables for definitions and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures.

EOG continued to lower operating costs during the fourth quarter 2019. Lease and well costs declined 13 percent, transportation costs fell five percent and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expenses fell six percent, all on a per-unit basis compared with the same prior-year period. The company also continued to implement sustainable efficiency improvements to reduce well costs. The fourth quarter improvements brought full-year 2019 well cost reductions to seven percent, two percentage points ahead of the target.

EOG generated $2.1 billion of discretionary cash flow in the fourth quarter 2019. After considering total cash capital expenditures before acquisitions of $1.4 billion, EOG generated free cash flow during the fourth quarter 2019 of $723 million. For the full year 2019, EOG generated $8.1 billion of discretionary cash flow and incurred total cash capital expenditures before acquisitions of $6.2 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $1.9 billion. Please refer to the attached tables for definitions and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures. As is further explained in the attached reconciliation tables, EOG now defines its free cash flow for a period as its discretionary cash flow for such period less its total cash capital expenditures (before acquisitions) for such period (without regards to the dividends paid in such period). EOG believes this definition of free cash flow is more consistent with that utilized by other companies in the industry. 

“Year after year, EOG keeps getting better, delivering record operating performance in 2019. Significant capital efficiency improvements from strong well productivity and sustainable cost reductions allowed us to deliver higher production with less capital investment than we planned at the beginning of the year,” said William R. “Bill” Thomas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We did this while generating substantial free cash flow, strengthening our financial position and increasing the dividend. This was the third consecutive year since our transition to premium drilling that EOG delivered double-digit returns and production growth along with strong free cash flow.”

2020 Capital Plan

The purpose of EOG’s annual capital program is to generate high returns on investment and increase the company’s business value. Exploration and development expenditures for 2020 are expected to range from $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion, including facilities and gathering, processing and other expenditures, and excluding acquisitions and non-cash exchanges. The disciplined capital program supports growth in crude oil production of 10 to 14 percent in 2020 and funds dividend payments with net cash from operating activities at less than $50 oil. 

Due to the decline in crude oil prices, the 2020 capital plan allocates slightly less capital to growing oil production than in 2019. To continue to improve the company, the 2020 plan allocates more capital than in 2019 to fund new high-quality drilling potential and high-return infrastructure to further lower EOG’s cost structure and environmental footprint. With the benefit of sustainable cost reductions and operational efficiencies, EOG expects to complete approximately 800 net wells in 2020 compared with 750 net wells in 2019. Activity will remain focused in EOG’s highest rate-of-return oil assets in the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford and Rocky Mountain Area. 

“EOG’s 2020 capital plan reflects continued improvement in capital efficiency, highlights the resiliency of our business model, and ensures the capital program and dividend payments can be funded at a conservative oil price. Looking to the future, our 2020 plan also invests in new high-return drilling potential and infrastructure development to lower costs and further improve the company,” Thomas said. “EOG’s sustainable competitive advantages already position us as one of the lowest cost oil producers in the global market and we are poised to extend our cost advantage well into the future.”

Dividend Increase

The board of directors declared a dividend of $0.375 per share on EOG’s Common Stock, an increase of 30 percent. The dividend will be payable April 30, 2020, to stockholders of record as of April 16, 2020. The indicated annual rate is $1.50 per share.

“EOG’s high-return premium drilling program and our low cost structure allow us to continue upholding the commitment we have made to return more cash to shareholders. This latest dividend increase demonstrates the confidence we have in our ability to grow cash flow, generate high returns through our premium well strategy and improve our future inventory with high quality new drilling potential," Thomas said.

Reserves

At year-end 2019, total company net proved reserves were 3,329 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), a 14 percent increase compared with year-end 2018. Net proved reserve additions from all sources, excluding revisions due to price, replaced 253 percent of EOG’s 2019 production at a finding and development cost of $8.21 per barrel of oil equivalent. Revisions due to price decreased net proved reserves by 60 MMBoe and asset divestitures decreased net proved reserves by five MMBoe. For more reserves detail and a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures please refer to the attached tables.

For the 32nd consecutive year, internal reserves estimates were within five percent of estimates independently prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton.

Financial Review

EOG further strengthened its financial position during the fourth quarter 2019. At December 31, 2019, EOG’s total debt outstanding was $5.2 billion for a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 19 percent. Considering cash on the balance sheet at the end of the fourth quarter, EOG’s net debt was $3.1 billion for a net debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 13 percent. For definitions and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the attached tables.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production, capital expenditures, costs and asset sales, statements regarding future commodity prices and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target," “aims,” "goal," "may," "will," "should" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, generate returns, replace or increase drilling locations, reduce or otherwise control operating costs and capital expenditures, generate cash flows, pay down or refinance indebtedness or pay and/or increase dividends are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known, unknown or currently unforeseen risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Furthermore, this press release and any accompanying disclosures may include or reference certain forward-looking, non-GAAP financial measures, such as free cash flow or discretionary cash flow, and certain related estimates regarding future performance, results and financial position. Because we provide these measures on a forward-looking basis, we cannot reliably or reasonably predict certain of the necessary components of the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures, such as future impairments and future changes in working capital. Accordingly, we are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of such forward-looking, non-GAAP financial measures to the respective most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures. Management believes these forward-looking, non-GAAP measures may be a useful tool for the investment community in comparing EOG’s forecasted financial performance to the forecasted financial performance of other companies in the industry. Any such forward-looking measures and estimates are intended to be illustrative only and are not intended to reflect the results that EOG will necessarily achieve for the period(s) presented; EOG’s actual results may differ materially from such measures and estimates. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others:

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose not only “proved” reserves (i.e., quantities of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable with a high degree of confidence), but also “probable” reserves (i.e., quantities of oil and gas that are as likely as not to be recovered) as well as “possible” reserves (i.e., additional quantities of oil and gas that might be recovered, but with a lower probability than probable reserves). Statements of reserves are only estimates and may not correspond to the ultimate quantities of oil and gas recovered. Any reserve or resource estimates provided in this press release that are not specifically designated as being estimates of proved reserves may include "potential" reserves, “resource potential” and/or other estimated reserves or estimated resources not necessarily calculated in accordance with, or contemplated by, the SEC’s latest reserve reporting guidelines. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in EOG’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, available from EOG at P.O.

Direct After-Tax Rate of Return (ATROR)

The calculation of our direct after-tax rate of return (ATROR) with respect to our capital expenditure program for a particular play or well is based on the estimated recoverable reserves ("net" to EOG’s interest) for all wells in such play or such well (as the case may be), the estimated net present value (NPV) of the future net cash flows from such reserves (for which we utilize certain assumptions regarding future commodity prices and operating costs) and our direct net costs incurred in drilling or acquiring (as the case may be) such wells or well (as the case may be). As such, our direct ATROR with respect to our capital expenditures for a particular play or well cannot be calculated from our consolidated financial statements.
