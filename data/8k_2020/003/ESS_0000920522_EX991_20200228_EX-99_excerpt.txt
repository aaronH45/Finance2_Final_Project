 LEGISLATIVE UPDATE & KEY MARKET STATS The Courtyards at 65th Street | Emeryville, CA    

 LEGISLATION UPDATE 22 Sources: The Sacramento Bee and California Department of Finance, Finance Bulletin Housing costs remain a key political and business issue across the country with many states implementing various forms of rent control legislation including Oregon, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New YorkCalifornia’s AB 1482 will cap renewal rents at CPI + 5%, providing renter protections while not destroying the incentive for new home developmentEssex has a long-standing guideline capping renewals at 10% and expects AB 1482 will result in approximately 10 bps impact to 2020 same-property revenues, primarily due to short-term rentalsCalifornia’s legislatures passed several housing related bills aimed at incentivizing affordable housing developmentA referendum to amend Costa Hawkins will be on the November 2020 ballot. A similar proposal was soundly defeated by voters in 2018 and the apartment industry is aligned to protect the incentive to build new homesIt is highly likely that California’s 2020 ballot will contain a proposal to modify Prop 13 for Commercial and Industrial Properties, creating a rolling 3 year re-assessment for property taxes. Fortunately, Apartment properties are not affected by the proposal“Since 2005 California has only produced 308 housing units for every 1,000 new residents. Add in the fact that California will be home to 50 million people by 2050, and it’s obvious we’re not on pace to meet that demand…we need to generate more funding for affordable housing, implement regulatory reform and create new financial incentives”– Governor Newsom

The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDAre is useful to investors, creditors and rating agencies because it allows investors to compare the Company’s credit strength to prior reporting periods and to other companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company’s actual credit quality.EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are not recognized measurements under U.S. GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.The reconciliations of Net Income available to common stockholders to EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are presented in the table below (Dollars in thousands):Three Months Ended December 31,2019    

 ENCUMBEREDEncumbered means any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, charge, pledge, security interest, security agreement or other encumbrance of any kind.FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (“FFO”) AND CORE FFOFFO, as defined by NAREIT, is generally considered by industry analysts as an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT. Generally, FFO adjusts the net income of equity REITs for non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization of rental properties, impairment charges, gains on sales of real estate and extraordinary items. Management considers FFO and FFO which excludes non-core items, which is referred to as “Core FFO,” to be useful supplemental operating performance measures of an equity REIT because, together with net income and cash flows, FFO and Core FFO provide investors with additional bases to evaluate the operating performance and ability of a REIT to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures and to pay dividends. By excluding gains or losses related to sales of depreciated operating properties and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies. By further adjusting for items that are not considered part of the Company’s core business operations, Core FFO allows investors to compare the core operating performance of the Company to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company’s actual operating results.FFO and Core FFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by U.S. GAAP and are not intended to indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of the REIT's operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. FFO and Core FFO do not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs including principal amortization, capital improvements and distributions to stockholders. FFO and Core FFO also do not represent cash flows generated from operating, investing or financing activities as defined under GAAP. Management has consistently applied the NAREIT definition of FFO to all periods presented. However, there is judgment involved and other REITs’ calculation of FFO may vary from the NAREIT definition for this measure, and thus their disclosures of FFO may not be comparable to the Company’s calculation.The reconciliations of diluted FFO and Core FFO are detailed on page S-3 in the section titled "Consolidated Funds From Operations“ of the earnings supplement for the fourth quarter of 2019.INTEREST EXPENSE, NETInterest expense, net is presented on page S-1 in the section titled "Consolidated Operating Results” of the earnings supplement for the fourth quarter of 2019.

 NET INDEBTEDNESS DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED EBITDAreThis credit ratio is presented on page S-6 in the section titled "Selected Credit Ratios” of the earnings supplement for the fourth quarter of 2019. This credit ratio is calculated by dividing net indebtedness by Adjusted EBITDAre, as annualized based on the most recent quarter, and adjusted for estimated net operating income from properties acquired or disposed of during the quarter. This ratio is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing the Company's ability to service debt obligations to that of other companies. Net indebtedness is total debt, net less unamortized premiums, discounts, debt issuance costs, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAre is set forth in "Adjusted EBITDAre Reconciliation" on page S-17.1 of the earnings supplement for the fourth quarter of 2019. The calculation of this credit ratio and a reconciliation of net indebtedness to total debt at pro rata share for co-investments, net is presented in the table below (Dollars in thousands): Excludes investment in mortgage backed securityBased on the amount for the most recent quarter, multiplied by four.Adjustments made for properties in lease-up, acquired, or disposed of during the most recent quarter and other partial quarter activity, multiplied by four. 43 RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND OTHER TERMS Total consolidated debt, net $ 5,808,873 Total debt from co-investments at pro rata share 916,077 Adjustments: Consolidated unamortized premiums, discounts, and debt issuance costsPro rata co-investments unamortized premiums, discounts, and debt issuance costs 33,4624,227 Consolidated cash and cash equivalents-unrestricted (70,087) Pro rata co-investment cash and cash equivalents-unrestricted (26,072) Marketable securities (1) (71,541) Net Indebtedness $ 6,594,939 Adjusted EBITDAre, annualized (2) $ 1,196,628 Other EBITDAre normalization adjustments, net, annualized (3) 2,795 Adjusted EBITDAre, normalized and annualized $ 1,199,423 Net Indebtedness Divided by Adjusted EBITDAre, normalized and annualized 5.5    

 NET OPERATING INCOME (“NOI”) AND SAME-PROPERTY NOI RECONCILIATIONSNOI and same-property NOI are considered by management to be important supplemental performance measures to earnings from operations included in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of income. The presentation of same-property NOI assists with the presentation of the Company’s operations prior to the allocation of depreciation and any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual communities or groups of communities.In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. The Company defines same-property NOI as same-property revenues less same-property operating expenses, including property taxes. Please see the reconciliation of earnings from operations to NOI and same-property NOI, which in the table below is the NOI for stabilized properties consolidated by the Company for the periods presented (Dollars in thousands): 44 RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND OTHER TERMS Three Months Ended Three Months Ended Twelve MonthsEnded Twelve MonthsEnded December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Earnings from operationsAdjustments: $ 116,818 $ 149,029 $ 481,112 $ 511,989 Corporate-level property management expenses 8,279 7,749 32,899 31,062 Depreciation and amortization 122,908 120,597 483,750 479,884 Management and other fees from affiliates (2,504) (2,371) (9,527) (9,183) General and administrative 15,531 16,912 54,262 53,451 Expensed acquisition and investment related costs 99 38 168 194 Impairment loss 7,105 - 7,105 - (Gain) Loss on sale of real estate and land 3,164 (39,617) 3,164 (61,861) NOI 271,400 252,337 1,052,933 1,005,536 Less: Non-same property NOI (18,274) (12,518) (63,492) (53,044) Same-Property NOI $ 253,126 $ 239,819 $ 989,441 $ 952,492 PUBLIC BOND COVENANTSPublic Bond Covenants refer to certain covenants set forth in instruments governing the Company's unsecured indebtedness. These instruments require the Company to meet specified financial covenants, including covenants relating to net worth, fixed charge coverage, debt service coverage, the amounts of total indebtedness and secured indebtedness, leverage and certain investment limitations. These covenants may restrict the Company's ability to expand or fully pursue its business strategies. The Company's ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by changes in the Company's operating and financial performance, changes in general business and economic conditions, adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting it. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Company's indebtedness, which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable. If any of the Company's indebtedness is accelerated, the Company may not be able to repay it. For risks related to failure to comply with these covenants, see "Item 1A: Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Financings" in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").The ratios set forth on page S-6 in the section titled "Public Bond Covenants" of the earnings supplement for the fourth quarter of 2019 are provided only to show the Company's compliance with certain specified covenants that are contained in indentures related to the Company's issuance of Senior Notes, which indentures are filed by the Company with the SEC. See, for example, the Indenture dated August 7, 2019, filed by the Company as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company's Form 8-K, filed on August 7, 2019. These ratios should not be used for any other purpose, including without limitation to evaluate the Company's financial condition or results of operations, nor do they indicate the Company's covenant compliance as of any other date or for any other period. The capitalized terms in the disclosure are defined in the indentures filed by the Company with the SEC and may differ materially from similar terms used by other companies that present information about their covenant compliance.SECURED DEBTSecured Debt means debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries which is secured by an encumbrance on any property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Company's total amount of Secured Debt is set forth on page S-5 of the earnings supplement for the fourth quarter of 2019.    

 UNENCUMBERED NOI TO ADJUSTED TOTAL NOIThis ratio is presented on page S-6 in the section titled "Selected Credit Ratios". Unencumbered NOI means the sum of NOI for those real estate assets which are not subject to an encumbrance securing debt. The ratio of Unencumbered NOI to Adjusted Total NOI for the three months ended December 31, 2019, annualized, is calculated by dividing Unencumbered NOI, annualized for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and as further adjusted for pro forma NOI for properties acquired or sold during the recent quarter, by Adjusted Total NOI as annualized. The calculation and reconciliation of NOI is set forth in "Net Operating Income ("NOI") and Same-Property NOI Reconciliations" above. This ratio is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing the Company's ability to service debt obligations to that of other companies. The calculation of this ratio is presented in the table below (Dollars in thousands): This table is based on the amounts for the most recent quarter, multiplied by four.Includes intercompany eliminations pertaining to self-insurance and other expenses. 45 RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND OTHER TERMS NOIAdjustments:NOI from real estate assets sold $ 1,085,600- Other, net (2) (7,123) Adjusted Total NOI 1,078,477 Less: Encumbered NOI (125,684) Unencumbered NOI $ 952,793 Encumbered NOI $ 125,684 Unencumbered NOI 952,793 Adjusted Total NOI $ 1,078,477 Unencumbered NOI to Adjusted Total NOI 88% AnnualizedQ4'19 (1)
