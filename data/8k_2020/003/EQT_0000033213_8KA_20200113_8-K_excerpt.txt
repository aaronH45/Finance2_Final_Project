 Item 8.01.Other Events.  

On January 13, 2020, EQT Corporation (EQT and, together with its subsidiaries, the Company) filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the Original Form 8-K), which, among other things, disclosed its estimate of the Company’s proved reserves as of December 31, 2019, which was prepared by the Company’s engineers and audited by Ryder Scott Company, L.P., the Company’s independent consulting firm (Ryder Scott). The Original Form 8-K included as Exhibit 99.2 a copy of Ryder Scott’s audit report, dated January 10, 2020 (the Original Petroleum Engineers’ Audit Report). 

In addition to the estimate of proved reserves, the Original Petroleum Engineers’ Audit Report included estimates of future net income (FNI) and discounted future net income (Discounted FNI) attributable to such reserves. EQT has since determined that the FNI and Discounted FNI amounts attributable to the estimated total proved reserves included in the Original Petroleum Engineers’ Audit Report were understated by approximately $1,651 million and $542 million, respectively, as a result of the misapplication of certain gathering and compression charges. A copy of the Ryder Scott audit report, amended to correct such error, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Except as set forth herein, the Original Form 8-K and the Original Petroleum Engineers’ Audit Report has not been changed.
