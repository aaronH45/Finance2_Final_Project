Recent Events

•AbbVie and Allergan announced that Allergan has entered into definitive agreements to divest brazikumab and Zenpep in conjunction with the ongoing regulatory approval process for AbbVie's acquisition of Allergan. AstraZeneca will acquire brazikumab, an investigational IL-23 inhibitor in Phase 2b/3 development for Crohn's Disease and in Phase 2 development for ulcerative colitis, including global development and commercial rights. Nestle will acquire and take full operational ownership of Zenpep, a treatment for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, as well as Viokace, another pancreatic enzyme preparation, as part of the transaction. The closings of the divestitures of brazikumab and Zenpep are contingent upon receipt of U.S. Federal Trade Commission and European Commission (EC) approval, closing of AbbVie's pending acquisition of Allergan and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. AbbVie and Allergan continue to expect to close the pending transaction in the first quarter of 2020.

•AbbVie announced regulatory approvals for RINVOQ (upadacitinib) for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The approvals from the EC and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare are based on results from the SELECT Phase 3 program, one of the largest registrational Phase 3 programs in RA, with approximately 4,400 patients evaluated across five studies. 

•AbbVie announced positive top-line data from the Phase 3 SELECT-PsA 1 study, the second of two registration-enabling trials evaluating RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). In this study, both doses of RINVOQ (15 mg and 30 mg, once daily) met the primary endpoint of ACR20 at week 12 versus placebo in adult patients with active PsA who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to one or more non-biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RINVOQ also demonstrated significant improvements in signs and symptoms of the disease across a variety of endpoints compared to placebo. Both doses of RINVOQ also significantly inhibited radiographic progression at week 24 compared to placebo. The 30 mg dose of RINVOQ achieved superiority to adalimumab in terms of ACR20 response at week 12, whereas both doses achieved non-inferiority vs. adalimumab. The safety profile of RINVOQ was consistent with previously reported results across indications, with no new safety risks detected. Detailed data from both pivotal studies will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and AbbVie expects to submit our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in PsA in the second quarter of this year.

•AbbVie announced positive data from a head-to-head Phase 3 study evaluating SKYRIZI (risankizumab) compared to Cosentyx in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. In the study, SKYRIZI met both primary endpoints and all ranked secondary endpoints, demonstrating higher rates of skin clearance compared to Cosentyx. SKYRIZI met the primary endpoint of superiority with at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) at week 52. Of patients treated with SKYRIZI, 87 percent achieved PASI 90 compared to 57 percent of Cosentyx-treated patients at 52 weeks. At week 16, SKYRIZI met the other primary endpoint of non-inferiority to Cosentyx, with 74 percent of SKYRIZI patients achieving PASI 90 compared to 66 percent of Cosentyx patients. SKYRIZI also showed superiority compared to Cosentyx for all ranked secondary endpoints, including PASI 100, and PASI 75, as well as a static Physician Global Assessment score of clear or almost clear at week 52. The safety profile of SKYRIZI was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies, with no new safety signals observed through week 52. SKYRIZI is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialization globally.

Recent Events (continued)

•At the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/Association for Rheumatology Health Professionals (ARHP) Annual Meeting, AbbVie presented data for RINVOQ, HUMIRA (adalimumab) and SKYRIZI, with 38 abstracts presented across multiple rheumatic conditions, including RA, ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and PsA. Included in the presentations were new data from the Phase 2/3 SELECT-AXIS 1 trial in which twice as many adult patients with active AS treated with RINVOQ achieved the primary endpoint of Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 40 response at week 14 versus placebo. The safety profile of RINVOQ was consistent with that of previous studies in rheumatoid arthritis, with no new safety risks detected. AbbVie also presented long-term data from the SELECT Phase 3 program further evaluating efficacy and safety across measures with RINVOQ, even without methotrexate, in patients with moderate to severe RA.

•AbbVie announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted a positive opinion for VENCLYXTO (venetoclax) in combination with obinutuzumab for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who were previously untreated. The CHMP positive opinion is based on results from the Phase 3 CLL14 clinical trial, which showed that patients who completed one year of treatment with VENCLYXTO plus obinutuzumab had prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and higher rates of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity compared to patients receiving a standard of care chemoimmunotherapy regimen of obinutuzumab and chlorambucil. This represents the third positive CHMP opinion for VENCLYXTO and if approved by the EC, VENCLYXTO plus obinutuzumab would be the first chemotherapy-free, oral combination regimen given with a fixed duration for patients with previously-untreated CLL. Venetoclax is being developed by AbbVie and Roche and is jointly commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, in the U.S. and by AbbVie outside of the U.S.

•AbbVie announced the submission of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) in combination with rituximab for the first-line treatment of younger patients (70 years old or younger) with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The application is being reviewed under the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program and is based on results from the Phase 3 E1912 study, which showed significantly improved PFS and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with IMBRUVICA plus rituximab compared to those treated with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR). Safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of IMBRUVICA and if approved, the milestone will mark the 11th FDA approval for IMBRUVICA across six distinct disease areas. IMBRUVICA is jointly developed and commercialized with Janssen Biotech, Inc.

•At the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting & Exposition (ASH), AbbVie presented data from more than 40 abstracts, including 18 oral presentations, featuring the latest scientific progress from its Hematologic Oncology programs. Key data presentations included new data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE study evaluating IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA (venetoclax) in previously untreated patients with CLL; new data from the Phase 3 E1912 study evaluating IMBRUVICA plus rituximab versus FCR in front-line CLL, results of a 7.5-year pooled analysis for IMBRUVICA monotherapy showing earlier treatment extended PFS and increased the likelihood of a complete response in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma; updated data from the Phase 3 MURANO trial four-year analysis demonstrating PFS and OS benefits with VENCLEXTA plus rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL; and results from a Phase 2 study of navitoclax in combination with ruxolitinib showing clinically meaningful spleen responses, reductions in allelic burden and improvements in total symptom score, as well as improvements in bone marrow fibrosis.

Profit Forecasts

AbbVie is issuing its GAAP diluted EPS guidance for the full-year 2020 of $7.66 to $7.76, representing growth of 46.0 percent at the midpoint.

AbbVie is issuing its adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the full-year 2020 of $9.61 to $9.71, representing growth of 8.1 percent at the midpoint.

AbbVie expects adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the first quarter of 2020 of between $2.28 and $2.30, excluding approximately 53 cents of non-cash amortization and other specified items.

The guidance statements above regarding GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS for the full-year 2020 and adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2020 each constitute a profit forecast for the purposes of the Rule 28 of the Irish Takeover Rules.

The company will issue 2020 proforma guidance following the close of the planned Allergan acquisition.

* Adjusted Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) is a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, typically reported in AbbVie’s quarterly and annual financial results for the full year guidance and in the earnings calls for the next quarter guidance updates. This is not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Adjusted EPS is calculated as net income excluding certain non-cash items and factors which are unusual or unpredictable, which include: amortization and impairment of intangible assets; change in fair value of contingent consideration; major restructuring costs, integration and other related transaction costs relating to acquisitions; litigation reserves; R&D milestones and acquired IPR&D, together with the tax effects of all these items.

Basis of Preparation

The AbbVie profit forecasts (the “Profit Forecasts”) are based on the forecast of the results for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020.

In accordance with Rule 28 of the Irish Takeover Rules, the directors of AbbVie confirm that the Profit Forecasts have been properly compiled on the basis of the assumptions stated below on a basis consistent with the accounting policies of AbbVie, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and those which AbbVie anticipates will be applicable for the full year ending December 31, 2020 (as adjusted for AbbVie non-GAAP policy to disclose adjusted earnings excluding specified items).

The AbbVie non-GAAP profit forecast does not include the proposed acquisition of Allergan. However, the AbbVie GAAP profit forecast includes estimated one-time expenses relating to the transaction such as financing costs, legal, consultants, accountants, regulatory and other fees, which are expected to be incurred in the first quarter of 2020.

Principal Assumptions

The Profit Forecasts have been compiled on the basis of the following assumptions:

Assumptions which are within AbbVie’s influence or control:

•Executed licensing and partnership collaboration transaction impacts and transactions expected to be executed in the next quarter are included.

No material acquisitions or disposals are anticipated in 2020;

•There will be no material change in the operational strategy or current management of AbbVie during the year ending December 31, 2020 other than those already announced;

 7

•Share repurchases and issuances are expected to be relatively flat during the twelve-month forecast period to December 31, 2020.

Assumptions which are outside of AbbVie’s influence or control:

•There will be no material supply chain, manufacturing and distribution disruptions and other business interruptions, including natural disasters or industrial disputes;

•There will be no material adverse events that affect AbbVie’s key products, including adverse regulatory and clinical findings or publications, product recalls, liability claims, or loss of patent protection; 

•There will be no material changes to current litigation provisions due to a new or ongoing litigation claim;

•There will be no material change in general market, economic, competitive environments or levels of demand in countries in which AbbVie operates that would materially affect AbbVie’s business;

•There will be no material change to AbbVie customers’ agreements, rebates, or discount programs from those currently prevailing;

•There will be no changes in exchange rates, interest rates, bases of taxes, tax laws or interpretations, or legislative or regulatory requirements from those currently prevailing that would have a material impact on AbbVie’s operations or its accounting policies;
