[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(2) During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded expense of $27.1 million in connection with upfront payments on strategic agreements that we entered into with Stealth BioTherapeutics Corp. (Stealth) and Immune Pharmaceuticals (Immune Pharma). During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded expense of $103.4 million in connection with upfront payments on strategic agreements that we entered into with Stealth, Immune Pharma, Eidos Therapeutics, Inc., Affibody AB and Zealand Pharma A/S.

(3) During the second and fourth quarters of 2018, we completed the acquisitions of Wilson Therapeutics AB (Wilson) and Syntimmune, Inc. (Syntimmune), respectively. The acquisitions were both accounted for as asset acquisitions, as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired were concentrated in a single asset. The value of the acquired in-process research and development assets was expensed during the quarters the acquisitions were completed due to the stage of development of the assets. In connection with the agreement of the final working capital adjustment for the Syntimmune acquisition, we recognized a benefit of $4.1 million associated with previously acquired in-process research and development in the second quarter of 2019.

(4) Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration expense for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 as well as the three months ended December 31, 2018 include the impact of changes in the expected timing of achieving contingent milestones, in addition to the interest component related to the passage of time. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the change in the fair value of contingent consideration expense was primarily due to amending certain contingent milestone payments due under our prior merger agreement with Enobia Pharma Corp. in September 2018 as well as due to increases in the likelihood and anticipated timing of payments for contingent consideration.

12

(5) On December 9, 2019, we sold our Moderna Therapeutics Inc. strategic equity investment. We received $114.7 million in net proceeds, resulting in a realized gain of $77.2 million on our initial investment. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a net gain of $19.7 million and $32.8 million in investment income, respectively, relating to our Moderna investment. Additionally, during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recognized an unrealized gain of $19.3 million and $26.9 million, respectively, in investment income to adjust our remaining strategic equity investments to fair value. During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we recognized unrealized gains of $57.7 million and $43.1 million, respectively, in investment income to adjust our strategic equity investments to fair value.

(6) In December 2019, we amended the terms of our agreement with Caelum Biosciences (Caelum) with respect to the option to acquire the remaining equity in Caelum. In conjunction with this amendment, we recognized a gain of $32.0 million in other income and (expense), which reflects an increase in the fair value of the option, less incremental upfront funding and the change in the fair value of contingent payments which we also modified as part of the amendment.

 (7) Alexion's non-GAAP income tax expense for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 excludes the tax effect of pre-tax adjustments to GAAP profit. Non-GAAP income tax expense for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 excludes a one-time tax benefit of $382.2 million related to the intra-entity asset transfer of intellectual property within our captive foreign partnership. Non-GAAP income tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 also excludes certain one-time tax benefits of $95.7 million and $30.3 million associated with a tax election made with respect to intellectual property of Wilson and a release of an existing valuation allowance, respectively, and excludes a one-time tax expense of $10.2 million related to the July 1, 2019 integration of Wilson intellectual property into the Alexion corporate structure. Non-GAAP income tax expense for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 excludes adjustments to provisional estimates of the impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we recorded in fourth quarter 2017.

(1) In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard that requires lessees to recognize leases on-balance sheet. We adopted the new standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The December 31, 2019 condensed consolidated balance sheet is presented under the new standard, while the December 31, 2018 condensed consolidated balance sheet is not adjusted and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for that period. Upon adoption of the new lease standard, we derecognized $472.8 million of property, plant and equipment and other assets and $372.2 million of facility lease obligations associated with previously existing build-to-suit arrangements which resulted in a decrease of $90.3 million to retained earnings, net of tax. In addition, we capitalized $326.1 million and $255.3 million of right of use assets and lease liabilities, respectively, within our condensed consolidated balance sheet upon adoption.
