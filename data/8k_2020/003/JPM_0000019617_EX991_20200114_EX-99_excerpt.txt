Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, commented on the financial results: “JPMorgan Chase produced strong results in the fourth quarter of 2019, capping off a solid year for the Firm where we achieved many records, including record revenue and net income. While we face a continued high level of complex geopolitical issues, global growth stabilized, albeit at a lower level, and resolution of some trade issues helped support client and market activity towards the end of the year. The U.S. consumer continues to be in a strong position and we see the benefits of this across our consumer businesses. In Consumer & Community Banking, average deposits grew at 5%, somewhat aided by lower short-term rates, and we continued to add customers in new and existing markets, and deepen our customer relationships by offering great deposit, investment and lending products. The robust holiday season was reflected in our card sales volumes and loan balances, up 10% and 8%, respectively.”

Dimon added: “The Corporate & Investment Bank generated record fourth quarter revenue - including for the Markets business, which rebounded from a challenging prior year. For the quarter, Global Investment Banking fees were up slightly from a strong performance last year, and for the full year we grew our IB fee wallet share to its highest level in a decade, maintaining our #1 rank for the 11th consecutive year. Commercial Banking earned a record $2.7 billion of IB revenue in 2019 and continued to add new client relationships on the back of our investments in bankers and technology in the U.S. and abroad. In Asset & Wealth Management, we grew loans and deposits at a healthy pace, and for the full-year, we brought in record long-term net flows of $100 billion.”

Dimon concluded: “We continue to invest in and grow our businesses. For example, in 2019, we added over 70 new branches in 16 new markets, continued our Commercial Banking international expansion, and became the first U.S. bank to be approved for a majority-owned securities business in China. We continue to make large investments in technology, including AI, cloud, digital and payments, as well as other investments in innovation, talent, security and risk controls. These actions will help us continue to grow and serve our clients going forward. I am extremely proud of how we serve our customers, clients and communities globally - we stand by them in good times and in tough times, and work to earn their trust every single day.”

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $4.2 billion, up 5%. Net revenue was $14.0 billion, up 3%.

The prior quarter also included a benefit from income related to loan sales in Home Lending. 

Noninterest expense of $343 million was lower by $165 million driven by the timing of contributions to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation in the prior year.

1. Notes on non-GAAP financial measures:

a.In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business. For a reconciliation of the Firm’s results from a reported to managed basis, see page 7 of the Earnings Release Financial Supplement.
