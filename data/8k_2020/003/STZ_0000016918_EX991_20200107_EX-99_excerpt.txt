HIGHLIGHTS[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Agrees to revise original Wine & Spirits agreement with Gallo in connection with Federal Trade Commission review; expected to close by the end of fiscal 2020

•In a separate, but related, transaction, agrees to divest Nobilo Wine brand to Gallo for $130 million; expected to close in first half fiscal 2021

•Signs agreement with Kings & Convicts Brewing to divest the Ballast Point brand and certain related facilities; expected to close by the end of fiscal 2020

•Promotes Garth Hankinson to Constellation’s CFO replacing David Klein who will assume the Canopy Growth CEO role

•Declares quarterly cash dividend

”It’s shaping up to be a dynamic year at Constellation. We delivered strong performance in Q3 powered largely by our beer business and we are increasing our EPS and cash flow guidance for the year. Our Wine & Spirits transformation strategy is gaining traction and our revised agreement with Gallo paves the way for accelerated growth and margin performance for this business going forward.” 

“The strong free cash flow we generated year to date reflects the powerful cash generation capability of our core business and will enable the company to return $4.5 billion in cash to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends through fiscal 2022. In addition, with debt reduction of almost $1.3 billion so far this year,

we’ve made significant progress toward achieving our leverage target of less than four times.”

(2) Three months ended November 30, 2018, includes an adjustment to remove volume associated with the Black Velvet Divestiture for the period November 1, 2018, through November 30, 2018.

(3) Three months ended November 30, 2018, includes $8.5 million of net sales and $4.3 million of gross profit less marketing that are no longer part of the wine and spirits segment results after the sale of the Black Velvet Canadian Whisky business (which occurred on November 1, 2019).

HIGHLIGHTS[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Power Brand depletion volume grew 3.3% and was impacted by a shift in Thanksgiving holiday timing with distributor and retailer replenishment shifting to fourth quarter. Power Brands priced at the greater than $11 retail price point grew 9% and gained share of higher-end wine in IRI channels.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•SVEDKA continued its hot streak with ongoing share gains in the U.S. vodka category growing nearly 8% in IRI channels.

● Operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 26.2% as mix benefits were more than offset by higher COGS and SG&A as a percent of net sales.

● The wine and spirits business now expects fiscal 2020 net sales and operating income decline of 8 - 10%, largely due to updated assumptions surrounding the close of the Gallo transactions.

Comparable basis (“comparable”) are amounts which exclude items that affect comparability (“comparable adjustments”), as they are not reflective of core operations of the segments. The company’s measure of segment profitability excludes comparable adjustments, which is consistent with the measure used by management to evaluate results. The company discusses various non-GAAP measures in this news release. Financial statements, as well as supplemental schedules and tables reconciling non-GAAP measures, together with definitions of these measures and the reasons management uses these measures, are included in this news release.

During the current quarter, Constellation Brands may reiterate the Projections. Prior to the start of the company’s quiet period, which will begin at the close of business on February 28, 2020, the public can continue to rely on the Projections as still being Constellation Brands’ current expectations on the matters covered, unless the company publishes a notice stating otherwise. During Constellation Brands’ “quiet period,” the Projections should not be considered to constitute the company’s expectations and should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update by the company.

The Projections should not be construed in any manner as a guarantee that such results will in fact occur. The pending Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction and the pending Nobilo Transaction (collectively, the “Wine and Spirits Transactions”) are each subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, receipt of required regulatory clearances and governmental approvals, and the pending Ballast Point transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions. The Nobilo Transaction is also conditioned on completion of the Revised Wine and Spirits Transaction. There can be no assurance the Wine and Spirits Transactions or the Ballast Point transaction will occur or will occur on the terms or timetables contemplated hereby.

In addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations, the Projections of the company contained in this news release are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:

•exact duration of the share repurchase implementation and the amount, timing, and source of funds for any share repurchases;

•amount and timing of future dividends are subject to the determination and discretion of the board of directors;

•raw material and water supply, production or shipment difficulties could adversely affect the company’s ability to supply its customers;

For periods of acquisition, we define organic net sales as current period reported net sales less net sales of products of acquired businesses reported for the current period, as appropriate. For periods of divestiture, we define organic net sales as prior period reported net sales less net sales of products of divested businesses reported for the prior period, as appropriate. We provide organic net sales because we use this information in monitoring and evaluating the underlying business trends of our core operations. In addition, we believe this information provides investors valuable insight on underlying business trends and results in order to evaluate year-over-year financial performance.
