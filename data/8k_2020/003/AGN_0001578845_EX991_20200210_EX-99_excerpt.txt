PIPELINE UPDATE

Allergan R&D continues to advance its pipeline. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company's key clinical developments included:Allergan received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the Company's New Drug Application (NDA) for UBRELVY™ (ubrogepant) for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. UBRELVY™ is a first-in-class oral CGRP receptor antagonist (gepant) for the treatment of migraine attacks once they start. Launch began in January 2020. Allergan announced the FDA has granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) Designation and Fast Track Designation for ATM-AVI (aztreonam and avibactam) for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative infections including complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP)/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP). ATM-AVI is an investigational, fixed-dose, intravenous combination antibiotic being developed jointly with Pfizer. The FDA approved Allergan's supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to expand the BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) label for the treatment of pediatric patients ages two years and older with lower limb spasticity, excluding spasticity caused by cerebral palsy. This marks the 14th approved indication for BOTOX® and BOTOX® Cosmetic combined in the U.S., and the 11th BOTOX® therapeutic indication. The FDA approved BOTOX® (onabotulinumtoxinA) for pediatric upper limb spasticity in the second quarter of 2019.

In addition to fourth quarter 2019 pipeline developments listed above, Allergan expects two additional significant launches in the next twelve months:FDA action is expected in the first half of 2020 on Allergan's NDA for Bimatoprost Sustained-Release, a biodegradable implant for the reduction of intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Launch is expected to follow in the first half of 2020. The FDA is currently reviewing a Biologics License Application (BLA) for Abicipar pegol, a novel, investigational DARPin® therapy, in patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). The FDA is expected to take action on the BLA in mid-2020, with launch expected to follow. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is also reviewing a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for Abicipar in patients with nAMD. A decision from the European Commission is expected in the second half of 2020.

UPDATE ON PROPOSED ABBVIE TRANSACTION

On January 10, 2020, AbbVie and Allergan received conditional approval from the European Commission for AbbVie's proposed acquisition of Allergan, subject to the approved divestiture of brazikumab (IL-23 inhibitor) and other conditions.

On January 27, 2020, Allergan announced that it entered into definitive agreements to divest brazikumab and ZENPEP® (pancrelipase) in conjunction with the ongoing regulatory approval process for the proposed transaction.

AstraZeneca will acquire brazikumab, currently in Phase 2b/3 development for Crohn's Disease and in Phase 2 development for ulcerative colitis, including global development and commercial rights. 

Nestle will acquire and take full operational ownership of ZENPEP® upon closing the transaction with customary transition support from Allergan. ZENPEP® is a treatment, which is available in the United States, for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis and other conditions. Nestle also will be acquiring Viokace, another pancreatic enzyme preparation, as part of the same transaction.

The closings of the divestitures of brazikumab and ZENPEP® are contingent upon receipt of U.S. Federal Trade Commission and European Commission approval, closing of AbbVie's pending acquisition of Allergan and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. 

Allergan expects the close of the pending AbbVie transaction around the end of the first quarter 2020, subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.

Due to the pending transaction, Allergan is not hosting a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results.
