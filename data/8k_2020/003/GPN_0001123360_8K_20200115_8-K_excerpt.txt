Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition

Merger with Total System Services, Inc.

On September 18, 2019, Global Payments Inc. (the "Company") completed its merger with Total System Services, Inc. ("TSYS"), with the Company as the surviving entity. TSYS' results of operations and financial position are included in the consolidated results of the Company from the date of the merger.

Supplemental Combined Financial Information 

Due to the significance of the merger with TSYS and the resulting change in our reportable segments, the Company is providing the supplemental combined financial information set forth in the attached schedules to enhance its shareholders' ability to evaluate the Company's operating performance on a combined basis with TSYS. The purpose of the supplemental combined financial information provided in Exhibit 99.1 is to reflect changes to our reportable segments and to present certain non-GAAP financial measures on a combined company basis for the first, second and third quarters of 2019. The schedules included in Exhibit 99.1 have been prepared by making certain adjustments to the sum of historical Global Payments financial information and historical TSYS financial information determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The adjustments are discussed in the notes to the schedules.

The information being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Report, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
