The entirety of this 584,000 square foot, Class A creative office campus in West Los Angeles will be occupied by Google, which is expected in the third quarter of 2022.

Financing Activity:

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS  

(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  

 (a)  

In accordance with the adoption of ASC Topic 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”) effective January 1, 2019, the Company is required to present all revenues related to its leases as a single line item. In addition, ASC 842 requires that the Company present lease revenues net of the Company’s provision for bad debts (See the Company’s Form 8-K supplemental financial information for further detail of the components of leasing revenue). For comparison purposes, the Company has reclassified minimum rents, percentage rents, tenant recoveries and the leasing portion of other revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Company’s provision for bad debts is included in shopping center and operating expenses.  

In accordance with ASC 842, the Company has expensed all leasing costs that were not incremental and contingent to the execution of new leases or lease renewals. For comparison purposes, the Company has reclassified leasing expenses for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 that were previously included in Management Companies’ operating expenses.  

 (b)  

The Company accounts for its investment in the Chandler Fashion Center and Freehold Raceway Mall (“Chandler Freehold”) joint venture as a financing arrangement. As a result, the Company has included in interest expense (i) a credit of $5,662 and $76,640 to adjust for the change in the fair value of the financing arrangement obligation during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively; and a credit of $5,946 and $15,225 to adjust for the change in fair value of the financing arrangement obligation during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, (ii) distributions of $2,027 and $7,184 to its partner representing the partner’s share of net income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively; and $2,502 and $9,079 to its partner representing the partner’s share of net income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively and (iii) distributions of $867 and $6,939 to its partner in excess of the partner’s share of net income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively; and distributions of $1,573 and $6,376 to its partner in excess of the partner’s share of net income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.  

 (c)  

The Macerich Partnership, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership” or the “OP”) has operating partnership units (“OP units”). OP units can be converted into shares of Company common stock. Conversion of the OP units not owned by the Company has been assumed for purposes of calculating FFO per share and the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The computation of average shares for FFO—diluted includes the effect of share and unit-based compensation plans, stock warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method. It also assumes conversion of MACWH, LP preferred and common units to the extent they are dilutive to the calculation.  

 (d)  

The Company uses FFO in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers FFO and FFO-diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) measures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, impairment write-downs of real estate and write-downs of investments in an affiliate where the write-downs have been driven by a decrease in the value of real estate held by the affiliate and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  

Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the Company revised its definition of FFO so that FFO excluded the impact of the financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, the Company now presents a separate non-GAAP measure—FFO excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold. The Company has revised the FFO presentation for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to conform to the current presentation. The Company accounts for its joint venture in Chandler Freehold as a financing arrangement. In connection with this treatment, the Company recognizes financing expense on (i) the changes in fair value of the financing arrangement, (ii) any payments to such joint venture partner equal to their pro rata share of net income and (iii) any

(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  

 payments to such joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income. The Company excludes the noted expenses related to the changes in fair value and for the payments to such joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income.  

The Company also presents FFO excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold, loss on extinguishment of debt and costs related to shareholder activism.  

FFO and FFO on a diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciation and amortization, as the Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Company believes that such a presentation also provides investors with a more meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other real estate investment trusts (“REITs”). In addition, the Company believes that FFO excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold, non-routine costs associated with extinguishment of debt and costs related to shareholder activism provide useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance as they show a more meaningful and consistent comparison of the Company’s operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare the Company’s results. The Company believes that FFO on a diluted basis is a measure investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities.  

The Company further believes that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as defined by GAAP, and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The Company also cautions that FFO as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs.

Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Operating Income (“NOI”) and to NOI—Same Centers:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (e)  

Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, noncontrolling interests in the OP, extraordinary items, loss (gain) on remeasurement, sale or write down of assets, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt and preferred dividends and includes joint ventures at their pro rata share. Management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps investors understand the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) or as a measure of liquidity. The Company also cautions that Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by other companies.  

 (f)  

The Company presents Same Center NOI because the Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate the operating performance of comparable centers. Same Center NOI is calculated using total Adjusted EBITDA and eliminating the impact of the management companies’ revenues and operating expenses, leasing expenses (including joint ventures at pro rata), the Company’s general and administrative expenses, costs related to shareholder activism and the straight-line and above/below market adjustments to minimum rents and subtracting out NOI from non-Same Centers.
