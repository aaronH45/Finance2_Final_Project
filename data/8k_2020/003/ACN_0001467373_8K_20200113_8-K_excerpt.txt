Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure

On January 13, 2020, Accenture plc (“Accenture”) issued a news release announcing changes to its growth model and Global Management Committee, effective March 1, 2020. The leadership appointments will become effective March 1, 2020. Information about these leadership changes is included in the news release, which also identifies where additional information can be located on Accenture’s website. As part of these changes, Accenture will organize its capabilities into four services: Strategy & Consulting; Interactive; Technology; and Operations. In addition, Accenture’s business will be managed through its three geographic markets: North America; Europe; and Growth Markets. 

As a result of these changes, Accenture will change its reporting segments from five reportable operating segments: Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources (the “Operating Groups”), to three reportable operating segments organized by Accenture’s three geographic markets: North America; Europe; and Growth Markets. Accenture has historically disclosed revenues for these geographic markets and the definitions of the geographic markets will not change as a result of implementation of these changes. Accenture will begin reporting under this segment structure in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Accenture will also continue to disclose revenues by Operating Group and type of work (consulting and outsourcing) and will continue to provide the same supplemental information regarding the “New” (digital, cloud, and security services) that the company currently provides. 

A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99 attached hereto, shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing made under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
