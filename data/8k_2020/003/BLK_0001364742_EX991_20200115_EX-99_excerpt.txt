Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and CEO: 

“Today’s results reflect the systematic investments we’ve made to build broader and deeper client relationships and meet their evolving needs.

“BlackRock’s 2019 results confirm the uniqueness of our globally integrated, asset management and technology platform. We generated a record $429 billion of total net inflows in 2019, representing 7% organic asset and 5% organic base fee growth, and ended the year with strong momentum, capturing $129 billion of flows in the fourth quarter. Full year flows were positive across product type and investment style, including records in cash, factors and illiquid alternatives. Continued investment in Aladdin, including the acquisition of eFront, drove record growth in technology services revenue to almost $1 billion for the year.  

“The recently announced acceleration of our sustainability efforts is yet another example of BlackRock’s commitment to helping clients build more resilient portfolios and navigate investment opportunities and risks. We begin 2020 well positioned to continue fulfilling our purpose and leading the evolution of the asset management industry.”

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (unaudited)  

BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.  

Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.  

10 

Computations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:  

(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees. Furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers. 

•  

Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. In 2018, a restructuring charge, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards, has been excluded to provide more meaningful analysis of BlackRock’s ongoing operations and to ensure comparability among periods presented. In addition, in 2018, the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. 

•  

Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.  

•  

Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries. 

(2) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.  

See aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation and restructuring charge.  

For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustments related to the restructuring charge and PNC LTIP funding obligation were tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustment. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. Amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. 

Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 

(3) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
