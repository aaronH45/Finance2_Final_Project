HOUSTON, Feb. 26, 2020 – Apache Corporation (NYSE, Nasdaq: APA) today announced its financial and operational results for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2019.  

Apache reported a loss of $3.0 billion or $7.89 per diluted common share during the fourth-quarter 2019. When adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of results, including primarily the impact of asset impairments in both the upstream assets in Alpine High and gathering, processing, and transmission assets from the consolidated results of Altus Midstream, Apache’s fourth-quarter income totaled $31 million, or $0.08 per share. Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $778 million, and adjusted EBITDAX was $1.1 billion.

For the full-year 2019, Apache reported a loss of $3.6 billion, or $9.43 per diluted common share. On an adjusted basis, Apache’s 2019 earnings totaled $2 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion, and adjusted EBITDAX was $4.0 billion.  

“Apache finished 2019 on a strong note. For the year, we achieved our corporate returns objective and came in below our upstream capital investment target of $2.4 billion. During the fourth quarter, our Permian region delivered the highest oil production in company history at 103,000 barrels per day and exceeded guidance. In December, we signed a joint venture agreement with Total in Block 58 offshore Suriname, which brings in a world-class offshore operator and enables Apache to retain a 50% working interest in the block while significantly reducing our potential exposure to large-scale appraisal and development costs. Our subsequent announcement of a significant oil discovery with the Maka Central-1 well in January 2020 underscores the transformational potential of Suriname Block 58. We are currently drilling the second well on Block 58, Sapakara West-1, and are encouraged by what we’ve seen so far. We will provide more information after reaching total depth and completing our analysis,” said John J. Christmann IV, Apache’s chief executive officer and president.  

Christmann continued, “Despite steady progress on many fronts in 2019, we also encountered some significant challenges, most notably around deteriorating natural gas and NGL prices and the performance of our multi-well development pad tests at Alpine High. To further align our investment program with these dynamics, we plan to significantly reduce our spending in 2020, predominantly in Alpine High.  

“Apache is well-prepared to navigate this challenging and volatile commodity price environment. We are continuing to streamline our portfolio, completing our comprehensive corporate redesign to centralize and align the organization and costs with projected long-term activity levels, investing to improve long-term returns and free cash flow, strengthening our balance sheet, and sustaining our dividend.

“While these steps are important to generate long-term returns, we must continue to deliver energy in a responsible manner and are taking a number of steps to prioritize ESG initiatives.”  

Specifically, over the last year, the company started to link ESG performance to short-term incentive compensation, earmarked 2020 capital specifically for sustainability projects, and began to align its 2019 sustainability report with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures’ (TCFD) recommendations and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s (SASB) Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Sustainability Accounting Standard.  

2020 capital budget and outlook  

In 2020, the company plans to invest $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion in upstream oil and gas capital, which, at the midpoint, represents a 26% reduction from 2019. If oil prices deteriorate from current levels, Apache is prepared to further reduce activity and capital investment. At higher oil prices, the priority will be to retain cash for debt reduction. The company does not anticipate increasing capital investment above $1.9 billion. This 2020 capital budget is projected to deliver flat to low single-digit total company oil production growth on an adjusted basis.  

“Apache’s portfolio is differentiated through both geographic diversification and an attractive balance of conventional and unconventional development opportunities. We have optionality to fund high-quality, shorter-cycle growth projects in the Permian Basin, Egypt and the North Sea, as well as longer-cycle organic exploration plays. We are choosing to allocate capital to Suriname over the next several years that could otherwise be directed toward near-term growth opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio. This is consistent with our strategy of investing for long-term returns with growth as an outcome,” Christmann concluded.

Drilling commenced in January and is ongoing on the Sapakara West-1 exploration well in Suriname Block 58, approximately 12 miles southeast of the Maka Central-1 discovery. The company has drilled through the shallower Campanian interval and drilling continues toward the deeper Santonian objectives. Once the well reaches total depth, the company will run open-hole logs, pressure tests, fluid and core samples, and associated laboratory analyses. Following Sapakara, the rig will drill a third, and likely a fourth exploration test in Block 58.  

Year-end 2019 proved reserves  

Worldwide estimated proved reserves totaled 1.01 billion BOE at year-end 2019. During the year, Apache added approximately 176.4 million BOE in field extensions and discoveries, more than offsetting production of approximately 172.9 million BOE. Divestitures reduced proved reserves by 107.6 million BOE. Negative price revisions, partially offset by positive performance revisions, further reduced proved reserves by 119.5 million BOE. More than 88% of Apache’s estimated proved reserves at year-end 2019 were classified as proved developed.

Apache posts announcements, operational updates, investor information and all press releases on its website, www.apachecorp.com.  

Additional information  

Additional information follows, including reconciliations of adjusted earnings, adjusted EBITDAX and net debt (non-GAAP financial measures) to GAAP measures and information regarding adjusted production. Apache’s quarterly supplement is available at www.apachecorp.com/financialdata.  

Non-GAAP financial measures  

Apache’s financial information includes information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of our consolidated financial information as prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted earnings, adjusted EBITDAX and net debt are non-GAAP measures. This non-GAAP information should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure.  

Forward-looking statements  

This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “continues,” “could,” “estimates,”

FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RESULTS

 “expects,” “guidance,” “may,” “might,” “outlook,” “possibly,” “potential,” “projects,” “should,” “will,” “would,” and similar references to future periods, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future plans, expectations and objectives for Apache’s operations, including statements about our capital plans, drilling plans, production expectations, asset sales, and monetizations. While forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and analyses made by us that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, whether actual results and developments will meet our expectations and predictions depend on a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results, performance, and financial condition to differ materially from our expectations. See “Risk Factors” in our 2018 Form 10-K and in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed, and 2019 Form 10-K when filed, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for a discussion of risk factors that affect our business. Any forward-looking statement made by Apache in this news release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Apache undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future development or otherwise, except as may be required by law.  

Cautionary note to investors  

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable, and possible reserves that meet the SEC’s definitions for such terms. Apache may use certain terms in this news release, such as “resources,” “potential resources,” “resource potential,” “estimated net reserves,” “recoverable reserves,” and other similar terms that the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit Apache from including in filings with the SEC. Such terms do not take into account the certainty of resource recovery, which is contingent on exploration success, technical improvements in drilling access, commerciality and other factors, and are therefore not indicative of expected future resource recovery and should not be relied upon. Investors are urged to consider carefully the disclosure in Apache’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2018 (and Apache’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2019, when filed) available from Apache at www.apachecorp.com or by writing Apache at: 2000 Post Oak Blvd., Suite 100, Houston, TX 77056 (Attn: Corporate Secretary). You can also obtain this report from the SEC by calling 1-800-SEC-0330 or from the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(In millions, except per share data)  

Reconciliation of Net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted EBITDAX  

Management believes EBITDAX, or earnings before income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation, amortization and exploration expense is a widely accepted financial indicator, and useful for investors, to assess a company’s ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures, and make distributions to shareholders. We define adjusted EBITDAX, a non-GAAP financial measure, as EBITDAX adjusted for certain items presented in the accompanying reconciliation. Management uses adjusted EBITDAX to evaluate our ability to fund our capital expenditures, debt services and other operational requirements and to compare our results from period to period by eliminating the impact of certain items that management does not consider to be representative of the Company’s on-going operations. Management also believes adjusted EBITDAX facilitates investors and analysts in evaluating and comparing EBITDAX from period to period by eliminating differences caused by the existence and timing of certain operating expenses that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. However, our presentation of adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies in our industry.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reconciliation of Income attributable to common stock to Adjusted earnings  

Our presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures because they exclude the effect of certain items included in Income Attributable to Common Stock. Management believes that adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share provides relevant and useful information, which is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry as well as by our management in assessing the Company’s operational trends and comparability of results to our peers.  

Management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share to evaluate our operating and financial performance because it eliminates the impact of certain items that management does not consider to be representative of the Company’s on-going business operations. As a performance measure, adjusted earnings may be useful to investors in facilitating comparisons to others in the Company’s industry because certain items can vary substantially in the oil and gas industry from company to company depending upon accounting methods, book value of assets, capital structure and asset sales and other divestitures, among other factors. Management believes excluding these items facilitates investors and analysts in evaluating and comparing the underlying operating and financial performance of our business from period to period by eliminating differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense and income items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. However, our presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies in our industry.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

(In millions)  

Reconciliation of Costs incurred to Upstream capital investment  

Management believes the presentation of upstream capital investments is useful for investors to assess Apache’s expenditures related to our upstream capital activity. We define capital investments as costs incurred for oil and gas activities, adjusted to exclude asset retirement obligation revisions and liabilities incurred, capitalized interest, and certain exploration expenses, while including amounts paid during the period for abandonment and decommissioning expenditures. Upstream capital expenditures attributable to a one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt are also excluded. Management believes this provides a more accurate reflection of Apache’s cash expenditures related to upstream capital activity and is consistent with how we plan our capital budget.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Reconciliation of Net cash provided by operating activities to Cash flows from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities  

Cash flows from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities is a non-GAAP financial measure. Apache uses it internally and provides the information because management believes it is useful for investors and widely accepted by those following the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of a company’s ability to generate cash to internally fund exploration and development activities, fund dividend programs, and service debt. It is also used by research analysts to value and compare oil and gas exploration and production companies and is frequently included in published research when providing investment recommendations. Cash flows from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities, therefore, is an additional measure of liquidity but is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities.
