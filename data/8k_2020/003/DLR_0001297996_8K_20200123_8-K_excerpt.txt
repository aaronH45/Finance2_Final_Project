 Item 1.01.  

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.   

On January 23, 2020, Digital Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (“DLR”), InterXion Holding N.V., a public limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap) organized under the laws of the Netherlands (“InterXion”), and Digital Intrepid Holding B.V. (formerly known as DN 39J 7A B.V.), a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) organized under the laws of the Netherlands (“Buyer”), entered into Amendment No. 1 to Purchase Agreement (“Amendment No. 1”), which amends the previously disclosed Purchase Agreement by and among DLR, Buyer and InterXion, dated as of October 29, 2019 (as amended, the “Purchase Agreement”), to, among other things, provide that if DLR or Buyer reduces the minimum tender condition of at least 80% of InterXion’s outstanding ordinary shares to 66 2/3% at the expiration of the exchange offer, then the exchange offer expiration will be extended for five business days. This extension of the exchange offer replaces a subsequent offering period of three business days following the expiration of the exchange offer. If DLR or Buyer does not reduce the minimum tender condition, or if DLR or Buyer reduces the minimum tender condition to 66 2/3% at any time prior to the expiration of the exchange offer, then following the expiration time Buyer shall provide a subsequent offering period of three business days. Amendment No. 1 also provides that if Buyer initiates the compulsory acquisition, then Buyer will request in the proceedings before the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeals (Ondernemingskamer van het gerechtshof Amsterdam) that the amount in cash to be paid to InterXion shareholders who did not tender their shares in the exchange offer be not less than the value of the offer consideration for shares that were tendered in the exchange offer.  

The foregoing description of Amendment No. 1 in this report is not intended to be a complete description thereof. The description is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Amendment No. 1, which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

(d) Exhibits.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Additional Information and Where to Find It  

On December 6, 2019, DLR filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, which included a proxy statement/prospectus. This communication is for information purposes only and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any proxy, vote or approval with respect to the proposed transaction or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. After the registration statement is declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), DLR intends to mail a definitive proxy statement/prospectus to shareholders of DLR and DLR intends to cause its subsidiary to file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (the “Schedule TO”) with the SEC, and soon thereafter InterXion intends to file a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the “Schedule 14D-9”) with respect to the exchange offer. The exchange offer for the outstanding ordinary shares of InterXion referred to in this document has not yet commenced. The solicitation and offer to purchase the ordinary shares of InterXion will only be made pursuant to the Schedule TO and related offer to purchase. This material is not a substitute for the proxy statement/prospectus, the Schedule TO, the Schedule 14D-9 or the Registration Statement or for any other document that DLR or InterXion may file with the SEC and send to DLR’s stockholders or InterXion’s shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions.  

BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING OR INVESTMENT DECISION OR DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER, WE URGE INVESTORS OF DLR AND INTERXION TO READ THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT, PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS, SCHEDULE TO (INCLUDING AN OFFER TO PURCHASE, RELATED LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND OTHER OFFER DOCUMENTS) AND SCHEDULE 14D-9, AS EACH MAY BE AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED FROM TIME TO TIME, AND OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED BY DLR AND INTERXION WITH THE SEC CAREFULLY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT DLR, INTERXION AND THE PROPOSED TRANSACTIONS.  

Investors will be able to obtain free copies of the Registration Statement, proxy statement/prospectus, Schedule TO and Schedule 14D-9, as each may be amended from time to time, and other relevant documents filed by DLR and InterXion with the SEC (when they become available) at http://www.sec.gov, the SEC’s website, or free of charge from DLR’s website (http://www.digitalrealty.com) or by contacting DLR’s Investor Relations Department at (415) 848-9311. These documents are also available free of charge from InterXion’s website (http://www.interxion.com) or by contacting InterXion’s Investor Relations Department at (813) 644-9399.  

Participants in the Solicitation  

DLR, InterXion and their respective directors and certain of their executive officers and employees may be deemed, under SEC rules, to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from DLR’s stockholders and InterXion’s shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions. Information regarding the officers and directors of DLR is included in its definitive proxy statement for its 2019 annual meeting filed with the SEC on April 1, 2019. Information regarding the officers and directors of InterXion and their ownership of InterXion ordinary shares is set forth in InterXion’s Annual Report on Form 20-F, which was filed with the SEC on April 30, 2019. Additional information regarding the persons who may be deemed participants and their interests will be set forth in the Registration Statement and proxy statement/prospectus and other materials when they are filed with SEC in connection with the proposed transactions. Free copies of these documents may be obtained as described in the paragraphs above.  

Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  

DLR cautions that statements in this communication that are forward-looking, and provide other than historical information, involve risks, contingencies and uncertainties that may impact actual results of operations of DLR, InterXion and the combined company. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements about the exchange offer and completion of the proposed transactions contemplated by the purchase agreement between them. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in those forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that those expectations will prove to have been correct. Those statements are made by using various underlying assumptions and are subject to numerous risks, contingencies and uncertainties, including, among others: the ability of DLR and InterXion to obtain the regulatory and shareholder approvals necessary to complete the anticipated combination, on the anticipated timeline or at all; the risk that a condition to the closing of the anticipated combination may not be satisfied, on the anticipated timeline or at all or that the anticipated combination may fail to close; the outcome of any legal proceedings, regulatory proceedings or enforcement matters that may be instituted relating to the anticipated combination; the costs incurred to consummate the anticipated combination; the possibility that the expected synergies from the anticipated combination will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period; difficulties related to the integration of the two companies; disruption from the anticipated combination making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees, regulators or suppliers; the diversion of management time and attention on the anticipated combination; adverse changes in the markets in which DLR and InterXion operate or credit markets; and changes in the terms, scope or timing of contracts, contract cancellations, and other modifications and actions by customers and other business counterparties of DLR and InterXion. If one or more of these risks materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors, please see (i) DLR’s filings with the SEC, including its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and (ii) InterXion’s filings with the SEC, including its annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2018 and its subsequent reports on Form 6-K. This communication reflects the views of DLR’s management as of the date hereof. Except to the extent required by applicable law, DLR undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement.
