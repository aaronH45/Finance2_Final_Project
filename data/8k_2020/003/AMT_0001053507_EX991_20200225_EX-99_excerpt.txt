AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Q4 2019 and full year 2019 growth rates were impacted by the nonrecurrence of the Company's settlement with Tata Teleservices Limited and related entities (collectively, “Tata”), which resulted in a net positive impact of $334 million to property revenue, $327 million to Adjusted EBITDA and $313 million to Consolidated AFFO in Q4 2018. The impact of the Tata settlement on net income is not provided, as the impact on all components of the net income measure cannot be reasonably calculated.

Boston, Massachusetts – February 25, 2020: American Tower Corporation (NYSE: AMT) today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2019.

Jim Taiclet, American Tower’s Chief Executive Officer, stated, “American Tower delivered another year of strong performance in 2019, including Organic Tenant Billings Growth of more than 7% in the U.S. We also added nearly 14,000 communications sites to our portfolio via high quality acquisitions in the U.S., Latin America, and Africa and the most substantial build-to-suit construction program in the Company’s history. Moreover, we again increased our dividend by 20% and simultaneously strengthened our investment-grade balance sheet with a number of refinancing transactions that reduced our cost of debt and extended maturities.

In 2020, we expect to make sustained progress in each of the key elements of our Stand and Deliver strategy to advance the Company’s vision of making wireless communication possible everywhere. By pursuing a broader leadership role in the industry, innovating for a 5G future, driving efficiency both internally and for our tenants, and thoughtfully growing our asset base, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong cash flow growth while expanding return on invested capital going forward.”

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS OVERVIEW

Acquisitions – During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company spent approximately $2.6 billion, including the assumption of existing debt, to acquire 8,218 communications sites. This included approximately 5,800 sites in Africa through the acquisition of Eaton Towers Holdings Limited (the “Eaton Towers Acquisition”) and approximately 2,400 sites in Chile and Peru from Entel PCS Telecomunicaciones S.A. and Entel Peru S.A. (“Entel”). For the full year 2019, the Company spent approximately $3.3 billion, including the assumption of existing debt, to acquire nearly 9,200 communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets.

This transaction is expected to close in multiple tranches beginning in the first half of 2020 for total consideration in the range of approximately 500 million to 600 million Euros (approximately $550.5 million to $660.5 million at the date of signing) to be paid over the five-year term.

Other Events – In April 2019, Tata Teleservices Limited (“Tata Teleservices”) served notice of exercise of its put options with respect to 100% of its remaining combined holdings with Tata Sons in ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (“ATC TIPL”).

After the completion of the redemption, the Company will hold an approximately 92% ownership interest in ATC TIPL.

Additionally, in connection with the closing of the Eaton Towers Acquisition, the Company entered into an agreement with its joint venture partner, MTN Group Limited (“MTN”), to acquire MTN’s noncontrolling interests in each of the Company’s joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda for total consideration of approximately $523 million. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval, and is expected to result in a one-time negative impact of approximately $65 million to the Company’s 2020 Consolidated AFFO from the payment of previously deferred cash interest related to joint venture debt.

LEVERAGE AND FINANCING OVERVIEW

Leverage – For the quarter ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s Net Leverage Ratio was 4.6x net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) to fourth quarter 2019 annualized Adjusted EBITDA. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________

(1)Q4 2019 Adjusted EBITDA multiplied by four.

Liquidity – As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $4.4 billion of total liquidity, consisting of $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents plus the ability to borrow an aggregate of $2.9 billion under its revolving credit facilities, net of any outstanding letters of credit.

On October 3, 2019, the Company issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.750% senior unsecured notes due 2027 and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.700% senior unsecured notes due 2049. The Company used the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under its 2019 multicurrency credit facility and its 2019 364-day term loan. 

On December 20, 2019, the Company entered into amendments and restatements to its revolving credit facilities and term loan, which, among other things, increased the commitments under the 2019 multicurrency credit facility to $3.0 billion and the 2019 credit facility to $2.25 billion.

Subsequent to the end of 2019, on January 10, 2020, the Company issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.400% senior unsecured notes due 2025 and $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.900% senior unsecured notes due 2030. The Company used the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under its 2019 credit facility.

Upon completion of the redemption, none of the 5.900% notes remained outstanding.

On February 13, 2020, the Company entered into a loan agreement for a new $750.0 million unsecured term loan.

FULL YEAR 2020 OUTLOOK

The following full year 2020 financial and operational estimates are based on a number of assumptions that management believes to be reasonable and reflect the Company’s expectations as of February 25, 2020. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates as a result of various factors, and the Company refers you to the cautionary language regarding “forward-looking” statements included in this press release when considering this information.

The Company’s outlook is based on the following average foreign currency exchange rates to 1.00 U.S. Dollar for February 25, 2020 through December 31, 2020: (a) 70.00 Argentinean Pesos; (b) 4.25 Brazilian Reais; (c) 785 Chilean Pesos; (d) 3,390 Colombian Pesos; (e) 0.91 Euros; (f) 5.70 Ghanaian Cedis; (g) 71.50 Indian Rupees; (h) 102 Kenyan Shillings; (i) 19.00 Mexican Pesos; (j) 360 Nigerian Naira; (k) 6,530 Paraguayan Guarani; (l) 3.35 Peruvian Soles; (m) 15.00 South African Rand; (n) 3,700 Ugandan Shillings; and (o) 600 West African CFA Francs.

The Company’s outlook reflects estimated unfavorable impacts of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to property revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated AFFO, of approximately $85 million, $44 million and $41 million, respectively, relative to the Company’s 2019 results. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net income is not provided, as the impact on all components of the net income measure cannot be calculated without unreasonable effort. The Company is not providing outlook projections adjusted for the impacts of ICCC in 2020, as the Company believes the carrier consolidation process in India is largely complete. Although the Company anticipates that its churn rate will move closer to historical levels over time, given the uncertainty created by the recent court ruling by the Indian Supreme Court regarding the definition of adjusted gross revenue, the churn rate is expected to remain elevated in the immediate term.

Additional information pertaining to the impact of foreign currency and London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) fluctuations on the Company’s outlook has been provided in the supplemental disclosure package available on the Company’s website.

Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures

In addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) provided throughout this press release, the Company has presented the following Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures: Gross Margin, Operating Profit, Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Nareit Funds From Operations (FFO) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO), AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated AFFO per Share, AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders per Share, Free Cash Flow, Net Debt, Net Leverage Ratio and Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn (ICCC). In addition, the Company presents: Tenant Billings, Tenant Billings Growth, Organic Tenant Billings Growth and New Site Tenant Billings Growth.

These measures are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, they are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of the Company's core businesses and are commonly used across its industry peer group. As outlined in detail below, the Company believes that these measures can assist in comparing company performance on a consistent basis irrespective of depreciation and amortization or capital structure, while also providing valuable incremental insight into the underlying operating trends of its business.

5

Depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors, including historical cost basis, are involved. The Company's Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Revenue Components

In addition to reporting total revenue, the Company believes that providing transparency around the components of its revenue provides investors with insight into the indicators of the underlying demand for, and operating performance of, its real estate portfolio. Accordingly, the Company has provided disclosure of the following revenue components: (i) Tenant Billings, (ii) New Site Tenant Billings; (iii) Organic Tenant Billings; (iv) International pass-through revenue; (v) Straight-line revenue; (vi) Pre-paid amortization revenue; (vii) Foreign currency exchange impact; and (viii) Other revenue. 

Tenant Billings: The majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from non-cancellable, long-term tenant leases. Revenue from Tenant Billings reflects several key aspects of the Company’s real estate business: (i) “colocations/amendments” reflects new tenant leases for space on existing sites and amendments to existing leases to add additional tenant equipment; (ii) “escalations” reflects contractual increases in billing rates, which are typically tied to fixed percentages or a variable percentage based on a consumer price index; (iii) “cancellations” reflects the impact of tenant lease terminations or non-renewals or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced; and (iv) “new sites” reflects the impact of new property construction and acquisitions. 

New Site Tenant Billings: Day-one Tenant Billings associated with sites that have been built or acquired since the beginning of the prior-year period. Incremental colocations/amendments, escalations or cancellations that occur on these sites after the date of their addition to our portfolio are not included in New Site Tenant Billings. The Company believes providing New Site Tenant Billings enhances an investor’s ability to analyze the Company’s existing real estate portfolio growth as well as its development program growth, as the Company’s construction and acquisition activities can drive variability in growth rates from period to period. 

Organic Tenant Billings: Tenant Billings on sites that the Company has owned since the beginning of the prior-year period, as well as Tenant Billings activity on new sites that occurred after the date of their addition to the Company’s portfolio.

International pass-through revenue: A portion of the Company’s pass-through revenue is based on power and fuel expense reimbursements and therefore subject to fluctuations in fuel prices. As a result, revenue growth rates may fluctuate depending on the market price for fuel in any given period, which is not representative of the Company’s real estate business and its economic exposure to power and fuel costs. Furthermore, this expense reimbursement mitigates the economic impact associated with fluctuations in operating expenses, such as power and fuel costs and land rents in certain of the Company’s markets. As a result, the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pass-through revenue on certain revenue growth rates. 

Straight-line revenue: Under GAAP, the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract for certain of its tenant leases. Due to the Company’s significant base of non-cancellable, long-term tenant leases, this can result in significant fluctuations in growth rates upon tenant lease signings and renewals (typically increases), when amounts billed or received upfront upon these events are initially deferred. These signings and renewals are only a portion of the Company’s underlying business growth and can distort the underlying performance of our Tenant Billings Growth. As a result, the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of straight-line revenue on certain growth rates in revenue and select other measures.

Pre-paid amortization revenue: The Company recovers a portion of the costs it incurs for the redevelopment and development of its properties from its tenants. These upfront payments are then amortized over the initial term of the corresponding tenant lease. Given this amortization is not necessarily directly representative of underlying leasing activity on its real estate portfolio, (i.e. does not have a renewal option or escalation as our tenant leases do) the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pre-paid amortization revenue on certain revenue growth rates to provide transparency into the underlying performance of our real estate business. 

Foreign currency exchange impact: The majority of the Company’s international revenue and operating expenses are denominated in each country’s local currency. As a result, foreign currency fluctuations may distort the underlying performance of our real estate business from period to period, depending on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar. The Company believes it is appropriate to quantify the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its reported growth to provide transparency into the underlying performance of its real estate business. 

Other revenue: Other revenue represents revenue not captured by the above listed items and can include items such as tenant settlements and fiber solutions revenue.

Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measure Definitions

Tenant Billings Growth: The increase or decrease resulting from a comparison of Tenant Billings for a current period with Tenant Billings for the corresponding prior-year period, in each case adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth in recurring Tenant Billings and underlying demand for its real estate portfolio.

6

Organic Tenant Billings Growth: The portion of Tenant Billings Growth attributable to Organic Tenant Billings. The Company believes that organic growth is a useful measure of its ability to add tenancy and incremental revenue to its assets for the reported period, which enables investors and analysts to gain additional insight into the relative attractiveness, and therefore the value, of the Company’s property assets.

New Site Tenant Billings Growth: The portion of Tenant Billings Growth attributable to New Site Tenant Billings. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth attributable to Tenant Billings from recently acquired or constructed properties.

Indian Carrier Consolidation-Driven Churn (ICCC): Tenant cancellations specifically attributable to short-term carrier consolidation in India. Includes impacts of carrier exits from the marketplace and carrier cancellations as a result of consolidation, but excludes normal course churn. The Company believes that providing this additional metric enhances transparency and provides a better understanding of its recurring business without the impact of what it believes to be a transitory event.

Gross Margin: Revenues less operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations, depreciation, amortization and accretion, selling, general, administrative and development expense and other operating expenses. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site-level profitability of its assets. 

Operating Profit: Gross Margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site-level profitability of its assets while also taking into account the overhead expenses required to manage each of its operating segments. 

For segment reporting purposes, in periods through the third quarter of 2018, the Latin America property segment Operating Profit and Gross Margin also include interest income (expense), TV Azteca, net. Operating Profit and Gross Margin are before interest income, interest expense, gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, other income (expense), net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest and income tax benefit (provision). 

Operating Profit Margin: The percentage that results from dividing Operating Profit by revenue. 

Adjusted EBITDA: Net income before income (loss) from equity method investments, income tax benefit (provision), other income (expense), gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, interest expense, interest income, other operating income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion and stock-based compensation expense. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the profitability of its operations while at the same time taking into account the central overhead expenses required to manage its global operations. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector. 

Adjusted EBITDA Margin: The percentage that results from dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. 

Nareit Funds From Operations (FFO), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit), attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders: Net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by excluding the charges described above, particularly depreciation expenses, given the high initial, up-front capital intensity of the Company’s operating model. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector.

Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO): Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders before (i) straight-line revenue and expense, (ii) stock-based compensation expense, (iii) the deferred portion of income tax, (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges, (vi) other income (expense), (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, (viii) other operating income (expense), and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by further adjusting the Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders metric to exclude the factors outlined above, which if unadjusted, may cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of the Company’s property assets in those periods. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector.

Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders: Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders and the other line items included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. The Company believes that providing this additional metric enhances transparency, given the minority interests in its Indian and European businesses.

Consolidated AFFO per Share: Consolidated AFFO divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 

AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders per Share: AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.

7

Free Cash Flow: Cash provided by operating activities less total cash capital expenditures, including payments on finance leases and perpetual land easements. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as the basis for comparing our performance and coverage ratios with other companies in its industry, although this measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. 

Net Debt: Total long-term debt, including current portion and finance lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents.

Net Leverage Ratio: Net Debt divided by the quarter’s annualized Adjusted EBITDA (the quarter’s Adjusted EBITDA multiplied by four). The Company believes that including this calculation is important for investors and analysts given it is a critical component underlying its credit agency ratings.
