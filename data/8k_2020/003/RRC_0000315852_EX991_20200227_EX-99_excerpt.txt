NEWS RELEASE 

RANGE ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END 2019 RESULTS 

FORT WORTH, TEXAS, FEBRUARY 27, 2020…RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC) today announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2019 financial results.  

Highlights –  

•  

All-in 2019 capital spending was $728 million, approximately $28 million less than the original budget  

•  

Sold assets for gross proceeds of $785 million in 2019 to reduce debt  

•  

Fourth quarter cash unit costs improved by $0.26 per mcfe compared to prior year period 

•  

Year-end proved reserves increased to 18.2 Tcfe, with 95% from Marcellus Shale  

•  

All-in 2020 capital budget of $520 million maintains production at ~2.3 Bcfe per day 

•  

2020 well costs expected to average less than $610 per lateral foot in 2020, lowest in Appalachia 

•  

Expanded credit facility to $2.4 billion in October 2019, making year-end 2019 liquidity $1.7 billion  

Commenting on the results and 2020 plans, Jeff Ventura, the Company’s CEO said, “Range made solid progress on key strategic objectives in 2019. For the year, we reduced absolute debt, lowered well costs, improved our cost structure and delivered our operational plan for $28 million less than budgeted. During the year, Range executed approximately $785 million in asset sales and, in January, refinanced $550 million of nearer-term debt. These results reflect the organization’s continuing focus on capital discipline and further strengthening our financial position as we methodically develop the most prolific natural gas and NGL play in North America.  

The durability of Range’s high-quality resource base is demonstrated in the year-end PV10 reserve value of $7.6 billion, which equates to approximately $17 per share, net of debt. Our resilience is further demonstrated by the underlying efficiency of our 2020 capital program that can maintain production at 2.3 Bcfe per day for only $490 million of drilling and completion capital without a change in lateral inventory. Looking forward, I believe Range’s high-quality asset base, capital discipline and peer-leading operational efficiencies provide a solid foundation for creating stockholder value in the years ahead.”  

Financial Discussion  

Except for generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) reported amounts, specific expense categories exclude non-cash impairments, unrealized mark-to-market adjustment on derivatives, non-cash stock compensation and other items shown separately on the attached tables. “Unit costs” as used in this release are composed of direct operating, transportation, gathering, processing and compression, production and ad valorem taxes, general and administrative, interest and depletion, depreciation and amortization costs divided by production. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a definition of each of the non-GAAP financial measures and the tables that reconcile each of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 

Fourth Quarter 2019 Results 

GAAP revenues for fourth quarter 2019 totaled $606 million, GAAP net cash provided from operating activities (including changes in working capital) was $132 million, and GAAP earnings was a loss of $1.8 billion ($7.27 per diluted share). As previously disclosed in connection with Range’s recent notes offering, fourth quarter earnings results include a $1.1 billion proved property impairment and a $1.2 billion impairment of unproved properties associated with Range’s North Louisiana assets. Marcellus assets were not impaired during the quarter and are not anticipated to be impaired based on the current market, as the future undiscounted cash flows are materially above book value. Fourth quarter also included an $18 million derivative gain due to decreases in commodity prices. 

Non-GAAP revenues for fourth quarter 2019 totaled $637 million, and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital, a non-GAAP measure, was $175 million. Adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates, a non-GAAP measure, was $21 million ($0.08 per diluted share) in fourth quarter 2019. 

The following table details Range’s average production and realized pricing for fourth quarter 2019: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth quarter 2019 natural gas, NGLs and oil price realizations (including the impact of cash-settled hedges and derivative settlements which correspond to analysts’ estimates) averaged $2.76 per mcfe.  

•  

The average natural gas price, including the impact of basis hedging, was $2.19 per mcf, or a ($0.31) per mcf differential to NYMEX. Fourth quarter natural gas differential was impacted by weak basis pricing in October and November. Starting in December through early 2020, local Appalachian basis has normalized while premium northeast markets have weakened due to the warm winter season.  

•  

Pre-hedge NGL realizations were $17.52 per barrel, or $0.14 per barrel below the Mont Belvieu weighted barrel, as shown on Supplemental Table 9 on the Company’s website. Range continues to improve on its NGL pricing, as the fourth quarter differential to Mont Belvieu was another best in recent Company history. Range expects to maintain a strong NGL differential during 2020 as a result of access to international markets and its diversified portfolio of sales agreements. 

•  

Crude oil and condensate price realizations, before realized hedges, averaged $48.65 per barrel, or $8.21 below WTI.

Full-Year 2019 Results 

GAAP revenues for 2019 totaled $2.8 billion, GAAP net cash provided from operating activities (including changes in working capital) was $682 million, and GAAP net income was a loss of $1.7 billion ($6.92 per diluted share). Full-year 2019 earnings results include $2.3 billion of impairments associated with North Louisiana assets. Full-year 2019 results also included a $227 million derivative gain due to decreases in commodity prices. 

Non-GAAP revenues for 2019 totaled $2.8 billion, and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital, a non-GAAP measure, was $729 million. Adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates, a non-GAAP measure, was $98 million ($0.40 per diluted share) in 2019. 

The following table details Range’s average production and realized pricing for full-year 2019:

Capital Expenditures 

Fourth quarter 2019 drilling and completions expenditures were $126 million and in addition $26 million was spent on acreage. Total capital expenditures in 2019 were $728 million, including $667 million on drilling and completion, $57 million on acreage purchases and $4 million on gas gathering systems. Total capital expenditures in 2019 were $28 million less than originally budgeted, driven by continued improvement in Range’s drilling and completion efficiencies, water recycling program, and service cost reductions. 

Asset Sales 

As previously announced, during 2019, Range sold proportionately reduced 2.5% overriding royalty interests in southwest Appalachia for gross proceeds totaling $750 million. Range maintains a net revenue interest of approximately 79.5% on the subject acreage. Separately, during the year, Range sold miscellaneous unproved property and other legacy assets for $35 million. Net proceeds from sales during the year were used to reduce bank debt. Additional sale processes to monetize non-core assets remain underway.  

Financial Position and Repurchase Programs 

In October of 2019, Range increased bank commitments from $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion. The borrowing base of $3.0 billion remained unchanged and the maximum facility amount remained $4.0 billion. Range also initiated a share repurchase program in October, repurchasing 1.8 million shares during the fourth quarter for approximately $6.9 million. At year-end 2019, Range had approximately $93 million remaining on the $100 million repurchase program.  

Range repurchased and retired approximately $108 million in principal amount of its senior notes during the fourth quarter. Total senior notes repurchased during 2019 was approximately $202 million in principal amount at an average weighted discount to par of 3%. 

At December 31, 2019, Range had total debt outstanding of $3.2 billion, consisting of $2.7 billion in senior notes, $477 million in bank debt and $49 million in senior subordinated notes. As of year-end, the Company had approximately $1.7 billion of borrowing capacity available under the commitment amount. 

In January 2020, Range issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.25% senior notes due 2026. On the closing of the senior notes, proceeds were used to redeem $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s senior notes due 2021 and senior notes due 2022, which was completed in February 2020. Also announced in January, the Company suspended its dividend, which was approximately $20 million annually, to prioritize debt reduction.  

Operational Discussion 

Southwest Marcellus production for the fourth quarter of 2019 averaged approximately 2,063 net Mmcfe per day, a 16% increase over the prior year period. The northeast Marcellus assets averaged 98 net Mmcf per day during the quarter, inclusive of approximately 10 net Mmcf per day of legacy acreage production. North Louisiana production in the fourth quarter averaged approximately 183 net Mmcfe per day.  

Range brought on line 23 wells in southwest Appalachia during the fourth quarter, six in the super-rich area, 10 in the wet area and seven in the dry area. During the year, Range turned to sales a total of 84 Marcellus wells with an average lateral length of 10,550 feet and seven wells in Louisiana.

2020 Capital Spending Plans  

Range’s 2020 capital budget is $520 million. The capital budget includes approximately $490 million for drilling and recompletions (94% of the total), $30 million for leasehold and other capital expenditures. The Company expects to turn to sales 72 Marcellus wells in 2020 with an expected average lateral length of approximately 11,200 feet. Range anticipates drilling approximately 810,000 feet of lateral in 2020 while turning to sales approximately 806,400 feet of lateral during the year, keeping in-progress well inventory nearly unchanged going into 2021.  

The table below summarizes 2019 activity and estimates for 2020 regarding the number of wells to sales in each area.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2019 Proved Reserves  

Range previously announced 2019 proved reserves in January. Highlights from the announcement were: 

•  

Year-end 2019 SEC PV10 value of proved reserves was $7.6 billion 

•  

Year-end 2019 proved reserves increase to 18.2 Tcfe, with 95% from Marcellus 

•  

Future development costs for proved undeveloped reserves estimated to be $0.35 per mcfe 

Year-end 2019 reserves included 8.3 Tcfe of proved undeveloped reserves from 442 wells planned to be developed within the next five years. Beyond the five-year reserve calculation window, Range has more than 2,800 additional Marcellus locations available for development. Range also has a network of over 200 existing well pads designed to accommodate an average of 20 wells from any combination of Marcellus, Utica or Upper Devonian horizons. On average, existing pads contain five producing wells, providing Range the opportunity to develop thousands of future wells while utilizing existing roads, pads and infrastructure. Similar to prior years, approximately half of the wells planned to turn to sales in 2020 are from pad sites with existing production. 

The table below reflects Range’s estimate of the remaining core drilling inventory for the Marcellus.

Guidance – 2020  

Production per day Guidance 

Production for full-year 2020 is expected to average approximately 2.3 Bcfe per day, with ~30% attributed to liquids production. 

Full Year 2020 Expense Guidance  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Transportation guidance reflects the expected startup of Range’s Mariner East 2 capacity in April 2020, which can be filled with existing production. When this capacity starts, propane and butane volumes that had been transported by rail and sold net of transport, will be transported via pipe with sales price and transportation expense reported separately. The impact to financial statements is an increase in transportation expense, more than offset by an increase in realized NGL price. As a result of lower transport costs and elimination of other fees, the startup of this capacity provides annual uplift to cash flow in excess of $5 million. 

Full Year 2020 Price Guidance 

Based on current market indications, Range expects to average the following price differentials for its production in 2020.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Including basis hedging

(2) Weighting based on 53% ethane, 27% propane, 7% normal butane, 4% iso-butane and 9% natural gasoline. 

Hedging Status 

Range hedges portions of its expected future production volumes to increase the predictability of cash flow and to help maintain a strong, flexible financial position. At year-end 2019, Range had over 60% of its expected 2020 natural gas production hedged at a weighted average floor price of $2.64 per Mmbtu. Similarly, Range had hedged approximately 80% of its 2020 projected crude oil production at an average floor price of $58.27 per barrel. Please see Range’s detailed hedging schedule posted at the end of the financial tables below and on its website under Supplemental Tables.  

Range has also hedged Marcellus and other basis differentials for natural gas and NGL exports to limit volatility between benchmarks and regional prices. The combined fair value of the natural gas and NGL basis hedges as of December 31, 2019 was a net loss of $4.7 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

Adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates as set forth in this release represents income or loss from operations before income taxes adjusted for certain non-cash items (detailed in the accompanying table) less income taxes. We believe adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates is calculated on the same basis as analysts’ estimates and that many investors use this published research in making investment decisions and evaluating operational trends of the Company and its performance relative to other oil and gas producing companies. Diluted earnings per share (adjusted) as set forth in this release represents adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates on a diluted per share basis. A table is included which reconciles income or loss from operations to adjusted net income comparable to analysts’ estimates and diluted earnings per share (adjusted). On its website, the Company provides additional comparative information on prior periods along with non-GAAP revenue disclosures.  

Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital (sometimes referred to as “adjusted cash flow”) as defined in this release represents net cash provided by operations before changes in working capital and exploration expense adjusted for certain non-cash compensation items. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is widely accepted by the investment community as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company’s ability to generate cash to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is also useful because it is widely used by professional research analysts in valuing, comparing, rating and providing investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. In turn, many investors use this published research in making investment decisions. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations, investing, or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. A table is included which reconciles net cash provided by operations to cash flow from operations before changes in working capital as used in this release. On its website, the Company provides additional comparative information on prior periods for cash flow, cash margins and non-GAAP earnings as used in this release. 

The cash prices realized for oil and natural gas production, including the amounts realized on cash-settled derivatives and net of transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense, is a critical component in the Company’s performance tracked by investors and professional research analysts in valuing, comparing, rating and providing investment recommendations and forecasts of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry. In turn, many investors use this published research in making investment decisions. Due to the GAAP disclosures of various derivative transactions and third-party transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense, such information is now reported in various lines of the income statement. The Company believes that it is important to furnish a table reflecting the details of the various components of each income statement line to better inform the reader of the details of each amount and provide a summary of the realized cash-settled amounts and third-party transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense, which were historically reported as natural gas, NGLs and oil sales. This information is intended to bridge the gap between various readers’ understanding and fully disclose the information needed. 

The Company discloses in this release the detailed components of many of the single line items shown in the GAAP financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company believes that it is important to furnish this detail of the various components comprising each line of the Statements of Operations to better inform the reader of the details of each amount, the changes between periods and the effect on its financial results.

Finding and development cost per unit is a non-GAAP metric used in the exploration and production industry by companies, investors and analysts. Drill-bit development cost per mcfe is based on estimated and unaudited drilling, development and exploration costs incurred divided by the total of reserve additions, performance and price revisions. These calculations do not include the future development costs required for the development of proved undeveloped reserves. This reserves metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) method of computing finding costs contains additional cost components and results in a higher number. A reconciliation of the two methods is shown on our website at www.rangeresources.com.  

The reserve replacement ratio and finding and development cost per unit are statistical indicators that have limitations, including their predictive and comparative value. As an annual measure, the reserve replacement ratio can be limited because it may vary widely based on the extent and timing of new discoveries and the varying effects of changes in prices and well performance. In addition, since the reserve replacement ratio and finding and development cost per unit do not consider the cost or timing of future production of new reserves, such measures may not be an adequate measure of value creation.  

We believe that the presentation of PV10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure, or after-tax amount, because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. While the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company, PV10 is based on prices and discount factors that are consistent for all companies. Because of this, PV10 can be used within the industry and by creditors and security analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis. 

RANGE RESOURCES CORPORATION (NYSE: RRC) is a leading U.S. independent natural gas, NGL and oil producer with operations focused on stacked-pay projects in the Appalachian Basin. The Company pursues an organic development strategy targeting high return, low-cost projects within its large inventory of low risk drilling opportunities. The Company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas. More information information about Range can be found at www.rangeresources.com. 

Included within this release are certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that are not limited to historical facts, but reflect Range’s current beliefs, expectations or intentions regarding future events. Words such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “project,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “outlook”, “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “pursue,” “target,” “continue,” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.  

All statements, except for statements of historical fact, made within regarding activities, events or developments the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future, such as those regarding future well costs, expected asset sales, well productivity, future liquidity and financial resilience, anticipated exports and related financial impact, NGL market supply and demand, improving commodity fundamentals and pricing, future capital efficiencies, future shareholder value, emerging plays, capital spending, anticipated drilling and completion activity, acreage prospectivity, expected pipeline utilization and future guidance information, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are based on assumptions and estimates that management believes are reasonable based on currently available information; however, management's assumptions and Range's future performance are subject to a wide range of business risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that these goals and projections can or will be met. Any number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Further information on risks and uncertainties is available in Range's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless required by law, Range undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events after the date they are made.  

The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves, which are estimates that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future  

8 

years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions as well as the option to disclose probable and possible reserves. Range has elected not to disclose its probable and possible reserves in its filings with the SEC. Range uses certain broader terms such as "resource potential,” “unrisked resource potential,” "unproved resource potential" or "upside" or other descriptions of volumes of resources potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that may include probable and possible reserves as defined by the SEC's guidelines. Range has not attempted to distinguish probable and possible reserves from these broader classifications. The SEC’s rules prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC these broader classifications of reserves. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized. Unproved resource potential refers to Range's internal estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be potentially discovered through exploratory drilling or recovered with additional drilling or recovery techniques and have not been reviewed by independent engineers. Unproved resource potential does not constitute reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer's Petroleum Resource Management System and does not include proved reserves. Area wide unproven resource potential has not been fully risked by Range's management. “EUR”, or estimated ultimate recovery, refers to our management’s estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be recovered from a well completed as a producer in the area. These quantities may not necessarily constitute or represent reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer’s Petroleum Resource Management System or the SEC’s oil and natural gas disclosure rules. Actual quantities that may be recovered from Range's interests could differ substantially. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of Range's drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, drilling and production costs, commodity prices, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals, field spacing rules, recoveries of gas in place, length of horizontal laterals, actual drilling results, including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates and other factors. Estimates of resource potential may change significantly as development of our resource plays provides additional data.  

In addition, our production forecasts and expectations for future periods are dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the undertaking and outcome of future drilling activity, which may be affected by significant commodity price declines or drilling cost increases. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, available from our website at www.rangeresources.com or by written request to 100 Throckmorton Street, Suite 1200, Fort Worth, Texas 76102. You can also obtain this Form 10-K on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
