Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

 The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K that is furnished under this Item 2.02 and 7.01, including the accompanying Exhibit 99.1, is being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 and 7.01 of Form 8-K and shall not be deemed to be “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section. The information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K that is furnished under this Item 2.02 and 7.01, including the accompanying Exhibit 99.1, shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date hereof, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

 On February 4, 2020, L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (“L3Harris”) issued a press release announcing, among other things, its results of operations and financial condition as of and for the fourth quarter and second half of calendar 2019 and its guidance for calendar 2020, including for expected revenue, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and cash flow. The full text of the press release and related financial tables is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

 The press release includes a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures (as defined below), including earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter, second half and full year of calendar 2019 and fourth quarter, second half and full year of calendar 2018; adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) and adjusted EBIT margin for the fourth quarter, second half and full year of calendar 2019 and fourth quarter, second half and full year of calendar 2018; free cash flow for the fourth quarter, second half and full year of calendar 2019 and fourth quarter, second half and full year of calendar 2018; adjusted free cash flow for the fourth quarter, second half and full year of calendar 2019 and fourth quarter, second half and full year of calendar 2018; expected earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for calendar 2020; and expected adjusted free cash flow for calendar 2020; in each case, adjusted for certain costs, charges, expenses, losses or other amounts as set forth in the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures included in the financial statement tables accompanying the press release. A “non-GAAP financial measure” is generally defined as a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future performance that excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments, so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). L3Harris management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. L3Harris management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze L3Harris business trends and to understand L3Harris performance. In addition, L3Harris may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.
