Fourth quarter 2019 results reflect a net $4 million, or $(0.01) per share, after-tax  reduction from notable items compared with a net $9 million, or $(0.02) per share, in fourth quarter 2018 and a net $4 million, or $(0.01) per share, in third quarter 2019. Full year 2019 net income available to common stockholders of $1.7 billion compares with $1.7 billion in 2018, with EPS of $3.81, up 8% from $3.52 in 2018. 2019 ROTCE of 12.6% compares with 12.9% in 2018. 2019 results reflect a net $17 million after-tax reduction, or $(0.03) per fully diluted share, from notable items compared with a net $16 million, or $(0.04) per share, in 2018.  

On an Underlying basis, which excludes notable items, fourth quarter 2019 net income available to common stockholders of $431 million decreased 6% from fourth quarter 2018 and 1% from third quarter 2019. Underlying EPS of $0.99 per share increased 1% from fourth quarter 2018 and 1% from third quarter 2019. Underlying fourth quarter 2019 ROTCE of 12.5% compares with 14.1% in fourth quarter 2018 and 12.6% in third quarter 2019. Tangible book value per common share of $32.08 increased 12% from fourth quarter 2018 and 2% from third quarter 2019. On an Underlying basis, full year 2019 net income available to common stockholders of $1.7 billion increased 2% and diluted EPS of $3.84 increased 8% from 2018 levels. On an Underlying basis, 2019 ROTCE of 12.8% compares with 13.1% in 2018 reflecting the challenging rate environment.

Fourth quarter 2019 vs. fourth quarter 2018  

Key highlights  

   • 

Fourth quarter results reflect revenue growth of $44 million, or 3%; up 2% on an Underlying basis, despite the challenging rate environment. Record Underlying noninterest income up 16%, paced by strong results in mortgage banking with record results in capital markets and foreign exchange and interest rate products.   

   • 

Fourth quarter 2019 results reflect a net $4 million after-tax reduction, or $(0.01) per share, from notable items compared with a net $9 million after-tax reduction, or $(0.02) per share, in fourth quarter 2018. Fourth quarter 2019 notable items, including a $24 million benefit, or $0.06 per share, largely tied to legacy tax matters, lowered the reported effective tax rate from approximately 21.5% to 16.8%, which helped offset TOP and integration costs.   

   • 

Results reflect an efficiency ratio of 60.3% and ROTCE of 12.4%; delivered an Underlying efficiency ratio of 58.0% and ROTCE of 12.5%.   

   • 

 Period-end loan-to-deposit ratio of 95.0% improved from 97.6%.   

   • 

Tangible book value per common share of $32.08 increased 12%. Fully diluted average common shares outstanding decreased 32.6 million shares, or 7%.   

Results  

   • 

Underlying total revenue increased $39 million, or 2%, reflecting strength in noninterest income and lower net interest income.   

   • 

Net interest income decreased 2%, reflecting the challenging rate and yield curve environment, partially offset by the impact of 4% growth in interest-earning assets.   

   • 

Net interest margin of 3.06% decreased 19 basis points, reflecting the impact of lower rates and higher prepayments on interest-earning asset yields, partially offset by the benefit of continued mix shift towards better-returning assets and deposit pricing discipline.   

   • 

Record Underlying noninterest income of $494 million increased $68 million, or 16%, driven by strong results in mortgage banking, record results in capital markets and foreign exchange and interest rate products and solid performance in trust and investment services fees.   

   • 

Noninterest expense increased 4%. Underlying noninterest expense of $949 million increased 5% reflecting higher salaries and employee benefits, equipment and software expense and outside services, given the impact of merit increases, higher revenue-driven incentives and investments in strategic growth initiatives.   

   • 

Provision expense of $110 million compares with $85 million in fourth quarter 2018, largely reflecting several modest losses in Commercial and the impact of continued seasoning in retail growth portfolios. Key credit metrics continue to reflect overall strong credit quality.   

   • 

ROTCE of 12.4% compares with 13.8% for fourth quarter 2018. Underlying ROTCE of 12.5% compares with 14.1% for fourth quarter 2018 and reflects an approximate 85 basis point drag from higher tangible common equity value, given the positive impact of lower long-term rates on securities valuations.

Notable items:  

2019 quarterly and fourth quarter 2018 results reflect notable items related to integration costs primarily tied to the August 1, 2018 Franklin American Mortgage Company (“FAMC”) acquisition. Fourth quarter and full year 2019 and 2018 results also reflect costs related to strategic initiatives. Fourth quarter 2019 results also include a tax benefit largely tied to legacy tax matters.

These notable items have been excluded from reported results to better reflect Underlying operating results.  

Total estimated after-tax FAMC integration costs are expected to be in the $40-$45 million range, with the integration substantially complete by second quarter 2020.

Discussion of results:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

1) Beginning in 1Q19, borrowed funds interest expense is based on original maturity and prior periods have been revised consistent with the current presentation.  

Net interest income decreased $29 million, or 2%, from fourth quarter 2018 as 4% growth in interest-earning assets was more than offset by a lower net interest margin reflecting the challenging rate and yield curve environment. Net interest margin of 3.06% decreased 19 basis points as the impact of lower short-term rates on loan yields and higher securities premium amortization tied to lower long-term interest rates was only partially offset by lower funding costs and the continued mix shift towards better-returning assets.  

Compared with third quarter 2019, net interest income of $1.1 billion was relatively stable as the benefit of 2% interest earning asset growth was offset by the impact of the challenging rate environment on net interest margin. Net interest margin of 3.06% decreased 6 basis points, as a reduction in interest-earning asset yields tied to lower interest rates was only partially offset by lower deposits costs and a mix shift in loans toward more attractive risk-adjusted categories. Interest-bearing deposit costs decreased 15 basis points, reflecting continued pricing discipline.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

1) Other income includes bank-owned life insurance and other income.  

13 

Noninterest income of $494 million increased $73 million, or 17%, from fourth quarter 2018, reflecting the impact of investments to broaden and enhance our fee income capabilities. Underlying noninterest income increased 16% driven by strong mortgage banking fees related to higher origination volumes, record results in capital markets and foreign exchange and interest rate products and solid performance in trust and investment services fees.  

Compared with third quarter 2019, record noninterest income reflects record results in capital markets and foreign exchange and interest rate products and solid results in trust and investment services fees were offset by a decrease in mortgage banking fees from record third quarter 2019 levels. Other income declined from higher third quarter 2019 levels that included a $7 million benefit related to the lease transaction.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth quarter 2019 noninterest expense of $986 million increased $35 million, or 4%, from fourth quarter 2018. Underlying noninterest expense of $949 million increased $43 million, or 5%, largely reflecting an increase in salaries and employee benefits given the impact of annual merit increases and revenue-based incentives, as well as an increase in equipment and software expense and outside services.  

Compared with third quarter 2019, noninterest expense increased $13 million, or 1%. Underlying noninterest expense of $949 million decreased $5 million, or 1%, from higher third quarter 2019 levels that included $10 million related to the lease transaction. Results also reflect continued focus on expense discipline and the benefit of TOP efficiency initiatives. Lower salaries and employee benefits tied to efficiency initiatives and lower incentive compensation were offset by higher outside services expense, which includes the impact of higher retail loan origination activity and seasonality.  

The fourth quarter 2019 effective tax rate of 16.8% reflects the impact of notable items including a tax benefit related to legacy tax matters. On an Underlying basis, the effective tax rate of 21.5% was broadly stable and compares to 21.9% for fourth quarter 2018 and 22.3% for third quarter 2019.

Compared with September 30, 2019, period-end interest-earning assets increased $1.7 billion, as a $2.5 billion increase in loans and loans held for sale was partially offset by a $787 million reduction in the investment portfolio. These results include the impact of a $1.1 billion transfer of on-balance sheet mortgage loans to held for sale in fourth quarter 2019 in connection with balance sheet optimization strategies. The average effective duration of the securities portfolio decreased to 3.7 years as of December 31, 2019 from 4.4 years at December 31, 2018, given lower long-term rates that drove an increase in securities prepayment speeds.

Total average loan growth was 1.8% before the impact of this transfer.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total period-end deposits of $125.3 billion at December 31, 2019 increased $5.7 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2018, driven by growth in money market accounts, checking with interest and savings, partially offset by a decrease in term deposits and demand deposits.

Overall credit quality remains strong, reflecting an improving risk profile in retail and a broadly stable risk profile in commercial. Nonperforming loans and leases decreased $63 million, or 8%, compared with December 31, 2018, reflecting a $44 million increase tied to commercial and a $107 million decrease in retail driven by improvements in home equity, education and auto. Compared to September 30, 2019, nonperforming loans and leases of $703 million decreased $34 million, or 5%, reflecting a $36 million decrease in commercial, partially offset by a $2 million increase in retail. The nonperforming loans and leases to loans and leases ratio of 0.59% at December 31, 2019 improved 4 basis points from 0.63% at September 30, 2019 and improved 7 basis points from 0.66% at December 31, 2018.  

Net charge-offs of $122 million increased $37 million from fourth quarter 2018, reflecting a $19 million increase in commercial and an $18 million increase in retail driven by expected seasoning in growth portfolios. Compared with third quarter 2019, net charge-offs of $122 million increased $9 million driven by a $14 million increase in retail reflecting seasonally-higher losses in auto and expected seasoning in other retail, partially offset by lower commercial, which reflects a $5 million impact tied to the third quarter 2019 lease restructuring transaction.  

Fourth quarter 2019 net charge-offs were 41 basis points of average loans and leases compared with 29 basis points in fourth quarter 2018 and 38 basis points in third quarter 2019.  

Allowance for loan and lease losses of $1.3 billion decreased $11 million from third quarter 2019 and increased $10 million from fourth quarter 2018 levels.

Key Performance Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations  

(in millions, except share, per-share and ratio data)  

Key Performance Metrics:  

Our Management uses certain key performance metrics (KPMs) to gauge our progress against strategic and operational goals, as well as to compare our performance against peers. The KPMs are referred to in our Registration Statements on Form S-1 and our external financial reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The KPMs include:  

   • 

Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE);   

   • 

Efficiency ratio;   

   • 

Operating leverage; and   

   • 

Common equity tier 1 capital ratio.   

Established targets for the KPMs are based on Management-reporting results which are currently referred to by the Company as “Underlying” results. In historical periods, these results may have been referred to as “Adjusted” or “Adjusted/Underlying” results. We believe that Underlying results, which exclude notable items, provide the best representation of our underlying financial progress toward the KPMs as the results exclude items that our Management does not consider indicative of our on-going financial performance. We have consistently shown investors our KPMs on a Management-reporting basis since our initial public offering in September of 2014. KPMs that reflect Underlying results are considered non-GAAP financial measures.  

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures:  

This document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted as Underlying results. In historical periods, these results may have been referred to as Adjusted or Adjusted/Underlying results. Underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which Management does not consider indicative of the Company’s on-going financial performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by our Management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day  operating decisions. In addition, we believe our Underlying results in any given reporting period reflect our on-going  financial performance in that period and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. We further believe the presentation of Underlying results increases comparability of period-to-period results. The following tables present reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  

Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements  

This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements regarding potential future share repurchases and future dividends are forward-looking statements. Also, any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “goals,” “targets,” “initiatives,” “potentially,” “probably,” “projects,” “outlook” or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” and “could.”  

Forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management, and on information currently available to management. Our statements speak as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future  

26 

performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation:  

   • 

Negative economic and political conditions that adversely affect the general economy, housing prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits which may affect, among other things, the level of nonperforming assets, charge-offs and provision expense;   

   • 

The rate of growth in the economy and employment levels, as well as general business and economic conditions, and changes in the competitive environment;   

   • 

Our ability to implement our business strategy, including the cost savings and efficiency components, and achieve our financial performance goals;   

   • 

Our ability to meet heightened supervisory requirements and expectations;   

   • 

Liabilities and business restrictions resulting from litigation and regulatory investigations;   

   • 

Our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the U.S. Basel III capital rules) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;   

   • 

The effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale;   

   • 

Changes in interest rates and market liquidity, as well as the magnitude of such changes, which may reduce interest margins, impact funding sources and affect the ability to originate and distribute financial products in the primary and secondary markets;   

   • 

The effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin;   

   • 

Financial services reform and other current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation and regulation relating to bank products and services;   

   • 

A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks; and   

   • 

Management’s ability to identify and manage these and other risks.   

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the actual amounts and timing of any future common stock dividends or share repurchases will be subject to various factors, including our capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, and regulatory and accounting considerations, as well as any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares or pay any dividends to holders of our common stock, or as to the amount of any such repurchases or dividends.  

More information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
