Impairment  

Our proved natural gas and oil properties are reviewed for impairment periodically as events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. As of September 30, 2019, the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties in the Appalachian Basin and North Louisiana was $5.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. We expect to record a significant non-cash impairment charge related to our natural gas and oil properties in North Louisiana during the fourth quarter of 2019, although we cannot currently estimate the value of the impairment. We do not expect to record any impairment charge related to our natural gas and oil properties in the Appalachian Basin.

These statements are based on assumptions and estimates that management believes are reasonable based on currently available information; however, management’s assumptions and the Company’s future performance are subject to a wide range of business risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that these goals and projections can or will be met. Any number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Further information on risks and uncertainties is available in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.  

In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4, is deemed to be “furnished” and shall not be deemed “filed” for the purpose of Section 18 of the Exchange Act or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall such information and exhibits be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.
