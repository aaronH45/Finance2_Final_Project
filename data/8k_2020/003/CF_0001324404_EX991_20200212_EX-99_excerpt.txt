Overview of Results

CF Industries Holdings, Inc. today announced full year 2019 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $493 million, or $2.23 per diluted share; EBITDA of $1,620 million; and adjusted EBITDA of $1,610 million. These results compare to the full year 2018 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $290 million, or $1.24 per diluted share; EBITDA of $1,429 million; and adjusted EBITDA of $1,403 million.

For the fourth quarter of 2019, net earnings attributable to common stockholders were $55 million, or $0.25 per diluted share; EBITDA was $306 million; and adjusted EBITDA was $325 million. These results compare to fourth quarter 2018 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $49 million, or $0.21 per diluted share; EBITDA of $349 million; and adjusted EBITDA of $341 million. 

“The CF team executed exceptionally well in 2019, achieving our lowest year-end recordable incident rate ever and delivering a 15 percent increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to 2018,” said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. “Our 2019 performance and our position on the low-end of the global nitrogen cost curve enabled us to generate more than $900 million in free cash flow, strengthen our balance sheet and increase shareholder participation in the underlying business. As a result, we delivered a one-year total shareholder return of 13 percent, which was the top performance in our fertilizer peer group.”

Operations Overview

CF Industries continued to operate safely and efficiently. As of December 31, 2019, the company’s 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate was 0.48 incidents per 200,000 work hours.

Gross ammonia production for the full year 2019 was approximately 10.2 million tons, and for the fourth quarter was approximately 2.7 million tons. 

Sales Overview

Net sales for the full year of 2019 were $4.6 billion compared to $4.4 billion in 2018 due primarily to higher average selling prices across most major products. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 were lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 due to lower selling prices across all major products compared to the prior year period, partially offset by higher sales volumes. 

Total sales volumes for full year 2019 were comparable to both full year 2018 and 2017. Sales volumes for the fourth quarter of 2019 were higher compared to the prior year period due to higher ammonia and ammonium nitrate (AN) sales, partially offset by lower granular urea sales. 

Average selling prices for the full year of 2019 were higher year-over-year across most major products due to a tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance than the prior year period and logistical issues in North America that limited supply at some inland locations during the spring application season. Average selling prices for the fourth quarter of 2019 were lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 across all major products due to greater global supply availability as a result of higher global operating rates driven by lower global energy costs.

Cost of sales for the full year of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower realized natural gas costs, partially offset by higher maintenance costs. 

In 2019, the average cost of natural gas reflected in the company’s cost of sales was $2.74 per MMBtu compared to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of $3.16 per MMBtu in 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the average cost of natural gas reflected in the company’s cost of sales was $2.36 per MMBtu compared to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of $3.24 per MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Market Overview

CF believes that near-term global nitrogen demand will be positive as application seasons develop in different regions of the world. In North America, crop futures combined with an expected return to traditional planting conditions in North America continue to support an increase in nitrogen-consuming planted corn and coarse grain acres in 2020 compared to 2019. 

Demand in India is expected to remain strong in 2020. In 2019, India tendered for a record 7.4 million metric tons of urea due to favorable growing conditions and strong consumption in the country. A new tender is expected in late March or early April. Urea tender volumes in India in 2020 may ease from 2019’s record high based on growing conditions and whether new domestic urea capacity increases total production, which has been affected by significant outages in existing facilities. Demand for urea in Brazil is expected to be positive in 2020, supported by lower domestic urea production.

Longer-term, the company expects that the global nitrogen market will tighten as industry fundamentals underpinning the global nitrogen cost curve continue to improve. 

CF projects that global demand growth for nitrogen over the next four years will outpace net capacity additions given the limited number of facilities currently under construction around the world. The company also expects Chinese coal-based nitrogen complexes to remain the global marginal urea producer and thus set the global price. Net Chinese-produced urea exports are likely to be in a range of 2-3 million metric tons annually, with additional Chinese 

 2 

export tons possible if urea supply is needed worldwide and global nitrogen prices support positive margins for Chinese marginal urea producers.

Producers in North America are expected to remain on the low-end of the global cost curve due to access to low-cost North American natural gas. Forward energy curves suggest the cost advantage per metric ton of urea for North American producers should remain well over $100 compared to Chinese anthracite-coal based producers. 

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures for the full year 2019 were $404 million. Capital expenditures in 2020 are estimated to be in the range of approximately $400 to $450 million.

Liquidity

As of December 31, 2019, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $287 million on the balance sheet, had no borrowings outstanding under its $750 million revolving credit facility and was in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements under its debt instruments. 

The company is currently executing a $1 billion share repurchase program that is authorized through 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the company repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares for $87 million. From February 2019, when the share repurchase authorization was announced, through December 31, 2019, the company has repurchased approximately 7.6 million shares for $337 million. 

On November 13, 2019, the company completed the redemption of all of the $500 million outstanding principal amount of its 7.125% Senior Notes due May 2020. Additionally, on December 13, 2019, the company redeemed $250 million principal amount, representing 50% of the $500 million outstanding principal amount, of its 3.400% Senior Secured Notes due December 2021. As a result, the aggregate principal amount of CF Industries Holdings, Inc.'s outstanding long-term indebtedness was $4.0 billion at the end of 2019. 

CHS Inc. Distribution

On January 31, 2020, the Board of Managers of CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN) approved a semi-annual distribution payment to CHS Inc. (CHS) of $88 million for the distribution period ended December 31, 2019. The distribution was paid on January 31, 2020. The total distribution to CHS pertaining to 2019 was approximately $188 million.

Management believes that EBITDA, EBITDA per ton, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA per ton, free cash flow, and, on a segment basis, adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales and adjusted gross margin per product ton and per nutrient ton, which are non-GAAP financial measures, provide additional meaningful information regarding the company’s performance and financial strength. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, EBITDA, EBITDA per ton, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA per ton, free cash flow, adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales and adjusted gross margin per product ton and per nutrient ton, included in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
