Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

On February 5, 2020, Cerner Corporation ("Cerner") and CompuGroup Medical SE ("CGM") jointly announced that they have entered into an agreement whereby CGM or its affiliate will purchase certain of the assets and liabilities related to Cerner's medico®, Soarian Health Archive®, Soarian® Integrated Care, and Selene® businesses for a purchase price of EUR 225 million, subject to working capital and other closing adjustments. Solutions and services related to these assets are sold primarily in Germany and Spain. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2020, subject to certain regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

The transaction is not expected to have a material impact on Cerner's results. The impact on revenue and earnings will be factored into Cerner's future quarterly guidance issued after the transaction closes, but it is not expected to be material. Cerner expects to largely offset any impact on earnings with its ongoing cost optimization efforts, so Cerner does not expect the transaction to result in adjustments to guidance for Adjusted Diluted EPS.

The information in Item 7.01 of this report (including Exhibit 99.1) is being furnished pursuant to Item 7.01 and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act.

All statements that do not directly and exclusively relate to historical facts constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions with respect to future events and are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties. It is important to note that Cerner's performance, and actual results, financial condition or business could differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. The words "expect", "believe", "future" or the negative of these words, variations thereof or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. For example, our forward-looking statements include statements regarding future benefits or synergies of the transaction, closing the transaction in the anticipated timeframe or at all and the impact of the transaction on our results or guidance. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to risks associated with the unexpected loss or recruitment and retention of key personnel related to these businesses; risks inherent with business acquisitions, such as the failure to obtain necessary regulatory or other approvals, satisfaction of the conditions to closing the transaction in the anticipated timeframe or at all or disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; inability to achieve expected operating efficiencies and sustain or improve operating expense reductions; and, failure of the parties to achieve the intended benefits. Additional discussion of these and other risks, uncertainties and factors affecting Cerner's business is contained in Cerner's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, since the statements speak only as of the date that they are made. Except as required by law, Cerner undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events, or changes in our business, results of operations or financial condition over time.
