© HELMERICH & PAYNE, INC. 2020 1 Forward - Looking Statements Forward Looking Statements This presentation contains forward - looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws. Forward - looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words or variation of words such as "expect," "look forward to," "an ticipate" "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "estimate," "will," "project" or words of similar meaning or other similar expressions. Forward - looking statements provide management's current expe ctations or predictions of future conditions, events or results. All statements that address operating performance, strategies, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward - looking statements. They may include estimates of revenues, market share, income, effective tax rate, earnings per share, cost savings, capital e xpe nditures, returning cash to stockholders through dividends or share repurchases, liquidity, capital structure or other financial items, descriptions of management's plans or objectives fo r f uture operations, products or services, or descriptions of assumptions underlying any of the above. All forward - looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and reflect the company's good faith beliefs, assumptions and expectations, but they are not guarantees of future performance or events. Furthermore, the company disclaims an y obligation to publicly update or revise any forward - looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions, factors, or expectations, new information, data or metho ds, future events or other changes, except as required by law. By their nature, forward - looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual resu lts to differ materially from those suggested by the forward - looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to a variety of economic, com petitive and regulatory factors, many of which are beyond the company's control, that are described in our Annual Report on Form 10 - K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 in the sections entitled "Risk Factors“ and “Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and additional factors we may describe fro m time to time in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You may get such filings for free at our website at https ://www.hpinc.com /. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and, consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties . Market and Industry Data The data included in this presentation regarding the oil field services industry, including trends in the market and the comp any 's position and the position of its competitors within this industry, are based on the company's estimates, which have been derived from management's knowledge and experience in the ind ust ry, and information obtained from customers, trade and business organizations, internal research, publicly - available information, industry publications and surveys and other contacts in the industry. The company has also cited information compiled by industry publications, governmental agencies and publicly - available sources. Although the company believ es these third - party sources to be reliable, it has not independently verified the data obtained from these sources and it cannot assure you of the accuracy or completeness of t he data. Estimates of market size and relative positions in a market are difficult to develop and inherently uncertain and the company cannot assure you that it is accurate. Accordin gly , you should not place undue weight on the industry and market share data presented in this presentation.

HPT – Helmerich & Payne Technologies Adding Value Through Automation: Wellbore Quality, Accuracy & Efficiency H&P Technologies develops, promotes and commercializes software technology offerings that create a compelling value opportunity for E&P companies 14 » Motive’s Bit Guidance System® helps to enable drilling of higher quality wellbores with a scalable, repeatable, data driven platform approach » MagVAR solution generally increases surveying accuracy by 50 - 60%, contributes to increased horizontal well economics while reducing risk » FlexApps are software applications that layer on top of our FlexRig drilling control systems and provide for machine - human collaboration during the drilling process to improve efficiency » AutoSlide solution utilizes machine learning and automation to interface with FlexRig control systems to perform slide drilling automatically via computer control (vs. traditional human control ) FlexApps TM AutoSlide SM All technologies priced separately from dayrate . Motive and MagVAR are rig agnostic, FlexApps and AutoSlide currently available on H&P rigs only.  

Planned Trajectory Without MOTIVE Traditional Directional Drilling Challenges » Well Design Difficult to Achieve • Poor drilling accuracy • Missed targets/pay zones » Inconsistent Practices • Increased tortuosity • P oor hole quality • Low rate of penetration • Completion issues » Human Made Drilling Decisions • Directional driller errors » Elevated Lifting Costs • Lower returns » Downhole Tool Failures MOTIVE Result » Improved Accuracy • Well drilled to plan • Higher production » Repeatable Results • Decreased tortuosity • Better hole quality • Less drilling time • Smoother completion » Reduces Human Error • Converting Art to Science • Allows de - manning at the rig site » Decreased Lifting Costs • Improved returns » Fewer Tool Failures Without Motive With Motive 15 Wellbore Quality Motive uses a data - driven platform intended to enhance wellbore quality and economics   

Wellbore Quality Matters Tortuosity Adversely Affects Overall Well Economics » Tortuosity increases pipe fatigue and downhole tool wear and failure » Increases drag when drilling and running casing » Increases drill - string fatigue when rotating » Reduces buckling resistance in drill pipe » Impedes hole cleaning while drilling » Tortuosity compromises quality and consistency » Compromises cement job quality » Causes variations in cross section » Reduces frac quality and increases frac costs » Tortuosity leads to adverse economics » Adversely affects production rate and quality » Compromises survey and geological modelling accuracy » Makes geo - steering more uncertain 16 Tortuosity is the amount of bends and twists in a well often referred to as doglegs; unwanted tortuosity is detrimental to well economics. Motive’s Bit Guidance System and AutoSlide can reduce tortuosity, which leads to improved well returns.   

MagVAR Survey Correction » Reservoir : Directly impacts well performance by increasing the reservoir volume exposed to stimulation; optimal drainage, more frac wings » Completions : improving hydraulic communication, reduce parent/child interference » Geology : better mapping improves prospectivity » Regulatory : greater confidence wells are within boundaries » Drilling : reduced collision risk for future in - fill drilling » Improved performance at reduced risk (enhanced returns) : » Reserve adds » Recovery factor » Production » Lower F&D/ boe Pay zone illustration courtesy of Pioneer Natural Resources F&D/ boe = finding and development cost per barrel of oil equivalent With MagVAR Optimal Spacing Without MagVAR Survey Error Leads to Inaccuracy Frac Collisions Stranded Hydrocarbon Wellbore Accuracy 17 Why is Wellbore Placement Critical?
