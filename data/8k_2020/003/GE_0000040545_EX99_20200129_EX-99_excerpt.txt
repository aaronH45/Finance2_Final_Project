BOSTON — January 29, 2020 — GE (NYSE:GE) announced results for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2019.

GE Chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. said, “The fourth quarter marked a strong close to the year for GE. We met or exceeded our full-year financial targets and are on a positive trajectory for 2020. We're proud of our progress in 2019, including decisive actions to reduce our leverage and strengthen our businesses. Our work continues, but GE's committed team, exceptional technology, and global network make me more confident than ever that we can deliver."

Culp continued, “Our priorities looking forward are clear. We are solidifying our financial position, continuing to strengthen our businesses as improvement efforts build momentum, and driving long-term profitable growth. We remain committed to creating value as we continue our multi-year transformation.” 

GE took action in 2019 on its strategic priorities:

•Reduced GE Industrial leverage, largely driven by reducing net debt* by $7 billion, bringing GE's net debt*/EBITDA* ratio from 4.8x in 2018 to 4.2x in 2019. Used cash from Wabtec and Baker Hughes transactions to pay down debt, including a $5 billion debt tender. Announced the sale of BioPharma to generate further cash for deleveraging as well as U.S. pension benefit changes to further reduce debt. 

•Reduced GE Capital leverage, largely driven by reducing GE Capital debt by $7 billion, bringing GE Capital's debt-to-equity ratio from 5.7x in 2018 to 3.9x in 2019. Completed asset reductions of approximately $12 billion, exceeding the 2019 target of $10 billion and the two-year target of $25 billion. 

•Strengthened GE's businesses. Aviation and Healthcare generated profitable growth, Power is stabilizing its businesses, Renewable Energy delivered a steep volume ramp in Onshore Wind to meet customer demand despite mixed performance overall, and GE Capital grew earnings partly through better operations.

•Began to drive Lean transformation and mindset throughout GE. Established common operating processes and metrics and a series of standard operational, talent, strategy, and budget reviews. Shifted decision-making and accountability to the businesses, including delayering Power and Renewable Energy. 

•Named new leaders, including Carolina Dybeck Happe as Chief Financial Officer (to start in early 2020), Kevin Cox as Chief HR Officer, Pat Byrne as CEO of Digital, Rachel Duan as CEO of Global Growth Organization, John Godsman as VP Business Development, Steve Winoker as VP Investor Relations, and in newly created roles, Monish Patolawala as VP Operational Transformation and Chris Pereira as Chief Risk Officer.

Total Company Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a- Excludes non-operating benefit costs, gains (losses), restructuring and other charges, goodwill impairments, tax reform enactment, debt extinguishment costs, BioPharma deal expenses, and 2019 Insurance premium deficiency test charge

Results by Reporting Segment

The following segment discussions and variance explanations are intended to reflect management’s view of the relevant comparisons of financial results.

Power

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Orders of $4.5 billion were down 30% reported and down 28% organically. Gas Power orders were down 8% reported and organically, largely driven by the non-repeat of a large turnkey equipment order. The business booked orders for 22 heavy-duty gas turbines, including three HA units and one aeroderivative unit, and services had its strongest orders growth quarter of 2019. Power Portfolio orders were down 57% reported and 55% organically, driven by the non-repeat of a large order in Steam Power. 

Revenues of $5.4 billion were flat reported and up 5% organically*, with Gas Power up 8% reported and 9% organically* and Power Portfolio down 16% reported and 4% organically*. Segment profit of $302 million was favorable both reported and organically*. Segment margins improved, largely due to better operational rigor and stronger processes at Gas Power as the charges it experienced in 2018 did not repeat. The team continues to stabilize operations and drive cost-out. 

Renewable Energy

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Orders of $4.7 billion were down 11% reported and 10% organically due to the non-repeat of large deals in Hydro and Grid Solutions. Onshore Wind orders were flat reported, and new order pricing in Onshore Wind continues to stabilize. Revenues of $4.7 billion were up 2% reported and 4% organically*. Onshore Wind marked record deliveries in the quarter of 1,553 total turbines and repower kits, with roughly two-thirds of these in the U.S. Segment profit of negative $197 million was driven by execution issues, particularly in Grid; price headwinds; tariffs; and increased R&D investment; partially offset by positive volume.

Aviation

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Orders of $10.7 billion were up 22% reported and 23% organically with equipment up 37%, primarily driven by orders for two years of end-market demand from the formation of the Aeroderivatives joint venture between Baker Hughes & GE Power following GE's deconsolidation of Baker Hughes. Services orders were up 12% reported. Revenues of $8.9 billion grew 6% reported and 7% organically* with equipment up 9% reported—driven by sales of 420 LEAP-1A and -1B units, up 41 from last year, partially offset by CFM56 unit volume—and services up 4% reported. Segment profit of $2.1 billion was up 19% reported and organically*, driven by improved volume, price, and net productivity, partially offset by engine mix. CFM continues to work closely with Boeing to ensure the safe return to service of the 737 MAX. 

*Non-GAAP Financial Measure 3

Healthcare

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Orders of $5.9 billion were up 2% reported and 3% organically, with Healthcare Systems up 1% organically, driven by growth in Life Care Solutions, Services, and Ultrasound, partially offset by Imaging. Life Sciences orders were up 10% organically. Revenues of $5.4 billion were flat reported and up 1% organically*, with Healthcare Systems down 1% reported and Life Sciences up 2% reported. Segment profit of $1.2 billion was up 1% reported and flat organically* driven by volume and cost productivity, offset by tariffs, price, and program investments. 

GE Capital

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Continuing operations generated net income of $69 million in the quarter, up $27 million from the same period last year excluding prior-year tax reform impact of $128 million, primarily due to lower marks and impairments and lower incurred interest expense, partially offset by lower gains, tax benefits, and operations. GE Capital ended the quarter with approximately $121 billion of assets, including $19 billion of liquidity. WMC, a discontinued U.S. mortgage subsidiary of GE Capital, concluded its Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, and as of year-end, GE Capital has no further liabilities to WMC.

GE Capital completed asset reductions of approximately $8 billion in the quarter, totaling approximately $12 billion in 2019, exceeding its 2019 target of $10 billion. It also enabled Industrial orders of $1.6 billion in the quarter and $6.2 billion in the year, primarily driven by Energy Financial Services' (EFS) support of Power & Renewable Energy. GE remains focused on de-risking GE Capital, including improving its leverage profile. It will complete its annual statutory cash flow test of its insurance business during the first quarter of 2020.

2020 Outlook

GE announced the following total company outlook for full-year 2020: 

•GE Industrial revenues* to grow organically in the low-single-digit range. 

•Adjusted GE Industrial profit margin* to expand organically in a range from 0 to 75 basis points. 

•Adjusted earnings per share* of $0.50 to $0.60. 

•GE Industrial free cash flow* of $2 billion to $4 billion. 

Compared to 2019, GE's 2020 outlook assumes lower cash and profit from BioPharma due to its planned disposition in the first quarter as well as reduced cash from Baker Hughes shareholder dividends in line with the orderly sale of GE's remaining stake. In 2019, for the full year, BioPharma generated approximately $1.3 billion* in cash and $1.5 billion in profit, and GE received approximately $350 million in Baker Hughes dividends. This outlook is also dependent on the 737 MAX's return to service, which GE is planning for in mid-2020, in line with Boeing. GE expects to offset these effects through performance improvements and reduced non-operational headwinds. GE also expects to achieve a GE Industrial net debt*/EBITDA* ratio of less than 2.5x, as well as a less than 4-to-1 debt-to-equity ratio for GE Capital, in 2020.

GE will hold an Investor Update on Wednesday, March 4, 2020, with additional details on its 2020 outlook, including by segment.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Segment revenues include sales of products and services related to the segment. Segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations, restructuring and other charges, the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries. Segment profit excludes or includes interest and other financial charges, non-operating benefit costs, income taxes, and preferred stock dividends according to how a particular segment's management is measured – excluded in determining segment profit for Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation and Healthcare; included in determining segment profit, which we sometimes refer to as "net earnings," for Capital. Other income is included in segment profit for the industrial segments. Certain corporate costs, such as those related to shared services, employee benefits and information technology are allocated to our segments based on usage. A portion of the remaining corporate costs is allocated based on each segment's relative net cost of operations. Industrial segment revenues and profit include the sum of our four industrial reporting segments without giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such segments and between these segments and our financial services segment. Total segment revenues and profit include the sum of our four industrial segments and one financial services segment, without giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such segments. We believe that this provides investors with a view as to the results of all of our segments, without inter-segment eliminations and corporate items.

(a)Represents the adding together of all GE Industrial affiliates and GE Capital continuing operations on a one-line basis. See Note 1 to the 2018 consolidated financial statements at www.ge.com/ar2018 for further information about consolidation matters.

(b)GE Capital cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $18.8 billion at December 31, 2019, including $0.9 billion which was subject to regulatory restrictions, primarily in insurance entities. Included in our credit facilities is an unused $20.0 billion back-up syndicated credit facility extended by 36 banks, expiring in 2021, and an unused $14.8 billion syndicated credit facility extended by six banks, expiring in 2020. The commitments under these syndicated credit facilities may be reduced by up to $6.7 billion due to offset provisions for any bank that holds a commitment to lend under both facilities. GE Capital has the right to compel GE to borrow under certain of these credit lines and transfer the proceeds as loans to GE Capital, which would be subject to the same terms and conditions as those between GE and the lending banks.

(c)Balance included consolidated restricted cash of $0.6 billion and $0.4 billion at December, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. GE restricted cash was $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and GE Capital restricted cash was $0.1 billion and an insignificant amount at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

(d)GE borrowings includes commercial paper of $3.0 billion at both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. GE Capital borrowings includes commercial paper of zero and an insignificant amount at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

(e)At December 31, 2019, the remaining GE Capital borrowings that had been assumed by GE as part of the GE Capital Exit Plan was $31.4 billion, for which GE has an offsetting receivable from GE Capital of $19.1 billion. The difference of $12.2 billion represents the amount of borrowings GE Capital has funded with available cash to GE via an intercompany loan in lieu of issuing borrowings externally.

(f)At December 31, 2019, total GE borrowings is comprised of GE-issued borrowings of $20.7 billion and the $12.2 billion of borrowings from GE Capital as described in note (e) above for a total of $32.9 billion.

GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY

Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP

We believe that presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides management and investors useful measures to evaluate performance and trends of the total company and its businesses. This includes adjustments in recent periods to GAAP financial measures to increase period-to-period comparability following actions to strengthen our overall financial position and how we manage our business.

In addition, management recognizes that certain non-GAAP terms may be interpreted differently by other companies under different circumstances. In various sections of this report we have made reference to the following non-GAAP financial measures in describing our (1) revenues, specifically GE Industrial segment organic revenues; Gas Power organic revenues; Power Portfolio organic revenues and GE Industrial organic revenues (2) profit, specifically GE Industrial segment organic profit; Adjusted GE Industrial profit and profit margin; Adjusted GE Industrial organic profit and profit margin; Adjusted earnings (loss); Adjusted earnings (loss) per share (EPS) and GE Industrial leverage EBITDA, (3) cash flows, specifically GE Industrial free cash flow (FCF) and BioPharma free cash flow, (4) debt balances, specifically, GE Industrial net debt and GE Industrial net debt/EBITDA ratio and (5) outlook, specifically 2020 Adjusted EPS; and 2020 GE Industrial free cash flows.

The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures follow. Certain columns, rows or percentages within these reconciliations may not add or recalculate due to the use of rounded numbers. Totals and percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions.

2020 OPERATING FRAMEWORK: 2020 ADJUSTED EPS (NON-GAAP)

We cannot provide a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and corresponding GAAP measure for Adjusted EPS* in 2020 without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty of timing of any gains or losses related to acquisitions & dispositions including our agreement to sell our BioPharma business, the timing and magnitude of the financial impact related to the mark-to-market of our remaining investment in Baker Hughes, and the timing and magnitude of restructuring expenses. Although we have attempted to estimate the amount of gains and restructuring charges for the purpose of explaining the probable significance of these components, this calculation involves a number of unknown variables, resulting in a GAAP range that we believe is too large and variable to be meaningful.

2020 OPERATING FRAMEWORK: 2020 GE INDUSTRIAL FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP)

We cannot provide a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and corresponding GAAP measure for GE Industrial Free Cash flow* in 2020 without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty of timing of deal taxes related to business sales.
