Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.   

On January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (the “Company”) amended the Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws (as amended, the “By-Laws”) to implement a proxy access provision, effective immediately. The new Section 2.11 allows an eligible stockholder or group of no more than 20 eligible stockholders to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials directors constituting up to the greater of two individuals or 20% of the Board (rounded down to the nearest whole number). An eligible stockholder or group of stockholders must have owned (as defined in the By-Laws) 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding shares entitled to vote for at least three years continuously. Such stockholders and their nominees must also satisfy the requirements specified in Section 2.11 and are otherwise subject to the terms and conditions of the By-Laws.  

The foregoing description of the By-Laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the By-Laws, a complete copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is hereby incorporated by reference in response to this Item 5.03.
