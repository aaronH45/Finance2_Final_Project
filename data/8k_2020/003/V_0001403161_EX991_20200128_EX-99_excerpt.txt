Fiscal First Quarter 2020 — Financial Highlights GAAP net income in the fiscal first quarter was $3.3 billion or $1.46 per share, increases of 10% and 12%, respectively, over prior year’s results. Current and prior year’s results included $13 million gains and $4 million losses for equity investments, respectively. Current year’s results also included $13 million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-recurring acquisition- related costs. Excluding these items, non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $3.3 billion or $1.46 per share, increases of 10% and 12%, respectively, over prior year’s results (refer to the accompanying financial tables for further details and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures presented). Non-GAAP earnings per share growth was approximately 14% on a constant-dollar basis. All references to earnings per share assume fully-diluted class A share count. Net revenues in the fiscal first quarter were $6.1 billion, an increase of 10%, driven by continued growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. Net revenues growth was over 11% on a constant-dollar basis. Payments volume for the three months ended September 30, 2019, on which fiscal first quarter service revenues are recognized, grew 9% over the prior year on a constant-dollar basis. Payments volume for the three months ended December 31, 2019, grew 8% over the prior year on a constant-dollar basis. Cross-border volume growth, on a constant-dollar basis, was 9% for the three months ended December 31, 2019. Excluding cross- border transactions within Europe, which have revenue yields similar to Europe’s domestic volume, growth was 9% in the quarter. Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by Visa, for the three months ended December 31, 2019, were 37.8 billion, an 11% increase over the prior year. Fiscal first quarter service revenues were $2.6 billion, an increase of 9% over the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 16% over the prior year to $2.9 billion. International transaction revenues grew 9% over the prior year to $2.0 billion. Other revenues of $365 million rose 22% over the prior year. Client incentives, which are a contra-revenue item, were $1.7 billion and represented 22.4% of gross revenues. GAAP operating expenses were $2.0 billion for the fiscal first quarter, a 14% increase over the prior year's results, including the amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-recurring acquisition-related costs. Excluding these operating expense items, non-GAAP operating expenses grew 13% over the prior year, primarily driven by personnel and general and administrative costs. GAAP non-operating expense was $42 million for the fiscal first quarter, including $13 million of net equity investment gains. GAAP and non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 17.7% for the quarter ended December 31, 2019. Cash, cash equivalents and investment securities were $14.4 billion as of December 31, 2019.

Other Notable Items On October 22, 2019, Visa announced it completed the acquisition of the token services and ticketing businesses of Rambus. These businesses will enable Visa to extend the security and convenience of tokenization to all types of transactions, including the ability to support domestic card networks and account-based and real-time payments systems. On December 13, 2019, the district court granted final approval of the 2018 settlement agreement relating to claims brought by the damages class plaintiffs in the multi-district litigation. The 2018 damages class settlement agreement included, among other terms, monetary relief for Visa and Mastercard merchants of approximately $5.5 billion. While the district court’s order is a significant step toward resolving this long-running litigation, the case is not yet fully resolved as several objectors have filed notices to appeal the district court’s decision. In addition, claims by merchants that opted out of the class settlement and by a class of merchants seeking injunctive relief against certain of Visa’s rules and practices remain pending. On January 13, 2020, Visa announced it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, a network that makes it easy for people to securely connect their financial accounts to the apps they use to manage their financial lives. Visa will pay $4.9 billion cash consideration and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. Starting in fiscal 2020, Visa revised its non-GAAP methodology to exclude the impacts of equity investment gains and losses, amortization of acquired intangible assets for acquisitions in fiscal year 2019 and forward, and non-recurring acquisition-related costs. Prior-year non-GAAP results were restated to reflect this change. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, Visa repurchased 13.0 million shares of class A common stock, at an average price of $179.71 per share, using $2.3 billion of cash on hand. The Company had $1.7 billion of remaining authorized funds for share repurchase as of December 31, 2019. On January 28, 2020, the board of directors authorized a new $9.5 billion class A common stock share repurchase program. On January 28, 2020, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as- converted basis) payable on March 3, 2020, to all holders of record as of February 14, 2020. Visa will host an Investor Day in San Francisco on Tuesday, February 11, 2020 beginning at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Visa’s management team will provide a comprehensive update of our strategies and key initiatives. A live webcast and replay of the presentation will be available at http://investor.visa.com. 3  

Financial Outlook for Fiscal Full-Year 2020 GAAP Foreign Adjusted Nominal-Dollar Currency Acquisition Constant-Dollar Basis Impact Impact Basis(1) Annual Net Revenues ~1% ~0.5% Low double-digit Low double-digit Growth decrease increase Client Incentives as a High end of 22.5% to High end of 22.5% to % of Gross Revenues 23.5% range 23.5% range Annual Operating ~1% 3% – 4% Mid-to-high Mid-single-digit Expense Growth(2) decrease increase single-digit Effective Tax Rate 19% – 19.5% 19% – 19.5% Annual Diluted Class A ~1% ~1% Common Stock Earnings Mid-teens Mid-teens decrease decrease Per Share Growth(3) (1) Adjusted financial outlook is on a constant-dollar basis and excludes non-GAAP equity investment gains and losses, amortization of acquired intangible assets for acquisitions in fiscal year 2019 and forward, and non-recurring acquisition- related costs. In addition, it excludes the operating revenues and expenses of the acquired entities that were not in the entire quarter of the previous year and the incremental interest expense or forgone interest income as a result of funding the acquisition through debt or cash, respectively. We believe presenting this adjusted outlook provides investors with additional insight into our expected operating performance for fiscal full-year 2020. The recently announced acquisition of Plaid is not included in our outlook as the transaction has not closed. (2) Annual adjusted operating expense growth is derived from non-GAAP full-year 2019 operating expenses of $7.6 billion, which excludes $0.4 billion impact of a non-GAAP special item. (3) Annual adjusted diluted class A common stock earnings per share growth is derived from adjusted full-year 2019 earnings per share results of $5.40, which excludes the non-GAAP impacts of a special item (~$0.12 decrease) and equity investment gains and losses (~$0.04 increase). Fiscal First Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call Details Visa’s executive management team will host a live audio webcast beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) today to discuss the financial results and business highlights.

 Visa Inc. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Results (unaudited) We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. Starting in fiscal 2020, we revised our non-GAAP methodology to exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs for acquisitions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods. Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to our current presentation. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded net realized and unrealized gains of $13 million and losses of $4 million, respectively, and related tax expense of $3 million and tax benefit of $1 million, respectively. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded amortization of acquired intangible assets of $11 million and related tax benefit of $3 million. There were no comparable amounts during the three months ended December 31, 2018 since we are only adjusting for transactions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded acquisition-related costs of $2 million. There were no comparable amounts during the three months ended December 31, 2018 since we are only adjusting for transactions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods. 11

Footnote Payments volume, including Visa Direct volume, represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume for the relevant period, and cash volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements obtained with these cards for the relevant period and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks, but excludes proprietary PLUS volume. Total volume represents payments and cash volume. Visa payment products are comprised of credit and debit programs, and data relating to each program is included in the tables. Debit programs include Visa’s signature based and Interlink (PIN) debit programs. The data presented is based on transactions processed by Visa and reported by Visa’s financial institution clients on their operating certificates. Estimates may be utilized if data is unavailable. On occasion, previously presented information may be updated. Prior period updates, if any, are not material. Visa’s CEMEA region is comprised of countries in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Several European Union countries in Central Europe, Israel and Turkey are not included in CEMEA. LAC is comprised of countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. International includes Asia Pacific, Canada, CEMEA, Europe and LAC. Information denominated in U.S. dollars is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which Visa Inc. volumes are reported (“Nominal USD”). These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the established exchange rate for each quarter. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring performance, Visa Inc. also reports year-over-year growth in total volume, payments volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information (“Constant USD”). This presentation represents Visa’s historical methodology which may be subject to review and refinement. 17
