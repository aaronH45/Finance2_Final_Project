 Springfield, MO, February 5, 2020 – O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. (the “Company” or “O’Reilly”) (Nasdaq: ORLY), a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry, today announced record revenues and earnings for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019.

 4th Quarter Financial Results  

 O’Reilly’s CEO and Co-President, Greg Johnson, commented, “We are pleased to once again report another profitable quarter, highlighted by a 4.4% increase in comparable store sales and a 14.2% increase in diluted earnings per share. While our comparable store sales results for the fourth quarter were in the top half of our expected range, we continued to see ongoing inflationary pressures in our expense structure, and primarily due to an unexpected surge in health benefit costs, our operating profit for the fourth quarter did not meet our expectations.”  

 Sales for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019, increased $168 million, or 7%, to $2.48 billion from $2.31 billion for the same period one year ago.

Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the fourth quarter increased 10% to $883 million (or 35.6% of sales) from $806 million (or 34.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 3% to $442 million (or 17.8% of sales) from $428 million (or 18.5% of sales) for the same period one year ago.  

 Net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019, increased $25 million to $325 million (or 13.1% of sales) from $300 million (or 13.0% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Diluted earnings per common share for the fourth quarter increased 14% to $4.25 on 76 million shares versus $3.72 on 81 million shares for the same period one year ago.  

 Full-Year Financial Results  

 Mr. Johnson continued, “Team O’Reilly’s commitment to providing the highest level of customer service in the industry, along with our relentless focus on profitable growth, resulted in full-year comparable stores sales growth of 4.0%, a 5.8% increase in full-year operating profit and an 11.1% increase in 2019 diluted earnings per share. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our Team for their continued dedication, hard work and commitment to O’Reilly’s ongoing success, highlighted by 2019 marking our 11th consecutive year of 10% or greater diluted earnings per share growth.”

Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased 7% to $5.39 billion (or 53.1% of sales) from $5.04 billion (or 52.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago.

Diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased 11% to $17.88 on 78 million shares versus $16.10 on 82 million shares for the same period one year ago.  

 Mr. Johnson concluded, “We successfully met our goal of 200 net, new store openings in 2019, in addition to converting 20 acquired Bennett stores to the O’Reilly brand. Also, we closed on our acquisition of Mayasa Auto Parts on November 29, 2019, and we are very pleased to officially welcome the over 1,100 Mayasa Team Members into the O’Reilly family. The Mayasa acquisition represents O’Reilly’s first expansion outside the U.S. as an international company, and we are excited to work together with the outstanding Mayasa team to build on their history of profitable growth as we enter the Mexican automotive aftermarket. We continued to enhance our industry-leading distribution network in 2019, as we successfully opened our 28th distribution center in Twinsburg, Ohio, and have two additional distribution center projects under construction in the Nashville and Memphis markets, which will both open in 2020. ”
