2020 Outlook

(WellCare), on Tuesday, March 3, 2020, with a conference call at 8:30 AM (Eastern Time) on Wednesday, March 4, 2020.

Additionally, excluding the effect of the WellCare acquisition, the Company's stand-alone 2020 guidance is unchanged from the guidance provided at our December investor day.

In summary, the 2019 fourth quarter and full year results were as follows:

•For the full year 2019, the effective tax rate was 26.5%, consistent with our previous guidance.

Balance Sheet

At December 31, 2019, the Company had cash, investments and restricted deposits of $21.4 billion, including $7.2 billion held by unregulated entities, reflecting the net proceeds from our $7.0 billion senior note issuance in advance of the closing of the WellCare acquisition. Medical claims liabilities totaled $7.5 billion. Total debt was $13.7 billion, which includes $93 million of borrowings on our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility at quarter end. The debt to capitalization ratio was 51.7% at December 31, 2019, excluding $194 million of non-recourse debt. Excluding non-recourse debt and the senior notes issued to fund the WellCare acquisition in advance of closing, our debt to capital was 34.3%.

A reconciliation of the Company's change in days in claims payable from the immediately preceding quarter-end is presented below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

State directed payments that we receive at the end of each quarter are recorded as a component of medical claims liability until paid. We have received state directed payments at the end of most quarters, which has increased our medical claims liability and our days in claims payable. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we did not have any material state directed payments included in our medical claims liability, which decreased our days in claims payable by two days.

Outlook

The Company expects to provide consolidated 2020 annual guidance, including the WellCare acquisition, on Tuesday, March 3, 2020, with a conference call at 8:30 AM (Eastern Time) on Wednesday, March 4, 2020. The Company continues to expect the WellCare acquisition to be no less than break even accretion for the first full year after closing and mid-to-upper single digit accretion in the second full year. Additionally, excluding the effect of the WellCare acquisition, the Company's stand-alone 2020 guidance is unchanged from the guidance provided at our December investor day.

Non-GAAP Financial Presentation

The Company is providing certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release as the Company believes that these figures are helpful in allowing investors to more accurately assess the ongoing nature of the Company's operations and measure the Company's performance more consistently across periods. The Company uses the presented non-GAAP financial measures internally to allow management to focus on period-to-period changes in the Company's core business operations. Therefore, the Company believes that this information is meaningful in addition to the information contained in the GAAP presentation of financial information. The presentation of this additional non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.  

Specifically, the Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP financial information that excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition related expenses, as well as other items, allows investors to develop a more meaningful understanding of the Company's performance over time. The tables below provide reconciliations of non-GAAP items ($ in millions, except per share data): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Other adjustments include the non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment of $271 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, debt extinguishment costs of $30 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, and the impact of retroactive changes to the California minimum MLR of $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. 

(2)The income tax effects of adjustments are based on the effective income tax rates applicable to each adjustment.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

To provide clarity on the way management defines certain key metrics and ratios, the Company is providing a description of how the metric or ratio is calculated as follows: 

•Health Benefits Ratio (HBR) (GAAP) = Medical costs divided by premium revenues.

•SG&A Expense Ratio (GAAP) = Selling, general and administrative expenses divided by premium and service revenues.

•Adjusted SG&A Expenses (non-GAAP) = Selling, general and administrative expenses, less acquisition related expenses.

•Adjusted SG&A Expense Ratio (non-GAAP) = Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses divided by premium and service revenues.

•Adjusted Net Earnings (non-GAAP) = Net earnings less amortization of acquired intangible assets, less acquisition related expenses, less the goodwill and intangible impairment, less debt extinguishment costs, less the 2018 impact of retroactive changes to the California minimum MLR, net of the income tax effect of the adjustments.

•Adjusted Diluted EPS (non-GAAP) = Adjusted net earnings divided by weighted average common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. 

•Debt to Capitalization Ratio (GAAP) = Total debt, divided by total debt plus total stockholder’s equity.

•Debt to Capitalization Ratio Excluding Non-Recourse Debt (non-GAAP) = Total debt less non-recourse debt, divided by total debt less non-recourse debt plus total stockholder’s equity.

•Average Medical Claims Expense (GAAP) = Medical costs for the period, divided by number of days in such period. Average Medical Claims Expense is most often calculated for the quarterly reporting period.

•Days in Claims Payable (GAAP) = Medical claims liabilities, divided by average medical claims expense. Days in Claims Payable is most often calculated for the quarterly reporting period.

In addition, the following terms referenced in this press release and other Company filings are defined as follows:

•State Directed Payments: Payments directed by a state that have minimal risk, but are administered as a premium adjustment. These payments are recorded as premium revenue and medical costs at close to a 100% HBR. The Company has little visibility to the timing of these payments until they are paid by a state. 

•Pass Through Payments: Non-risk supplemental payments from a state that the Company is required to pass through to designated contracted providers. These payments are recorded as premium tax revenue and premium tax expense.

MEDICAL CLAIMS LIABILITY 

The changes in medical claims liability are summarized as follows (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Centene's claims reserving process utilizes a consistent actuarial methodology to estimate Centene's ultimate liability. Any reduction in the “Incurred related to: Prior period” amount may be offset as Centene actuarially determines “Incurred related to: Current period.” As such, only in the absence of a consistent reserving methodology would favorable development of prior period claims liability estimates reduce medical costs. Centene believes it has consistently applied its claims reserving methodology. Additionally, approximately $49 million was recorded as a decrease to premium revenues resulting from development within “Incurred related to: Prior period” due to minimum HBR and other return of premium programs. 

The amount of the “Incurred related to: Prior period” above represents favorable development and includes the effects of reserving under moderately adverse conditions, new markets where we use a conservative approach in setting reserves during the initial periods of operations, receipts from other third party payors related to coordination of benefits and lower medical utilization and cost trends for dates of service December 31, 2018, and prior.
