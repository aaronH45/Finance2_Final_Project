EL DORADO, Arkansas, January 30, 2020 - Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE: MUR) today announced its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019, including a net loss attributable to Murphy of $72 million, or $0.46 net loss per diluted share. Adjusted net income, which excludes discontinued operations and other one-off items, was $25 million, or $0.16 per diluted share.

As previously announced, Murphy closed the Malaysia asset divestiture in the third quarter for $2.0 billion in cash proceeds.

Highlights for full year 2019 include:

•Attained 172 percent organic reserve replacement with an average three-year total finding and development cost of $12.95 per barrel of oil equivalent

•Transformed Murphy into an oil-weighted, Western Hemisphere focused company by closing two significant transactions with the Malaysia divestiture and Gulf of Mexico acquisition

•Increased average daily oil production from continuing operations by 66 percent, with total average daily production rising 41 percent from 2018 levels

1

•Generated $1.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA, or $23.99 per barrel of oil equivalent sold

•Drilled successful exploration wells in Vietnam, Gulf of Mexico and offshore Mexico

FOURTH QUARTER 2019 RESULTS

The company recorded a net loss, attributable to Murphy, of $72 million, or $0.46 net loss per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2019. Adjusted net income, which excludes both the results of discontinued operations and certain other items that affect comparability of results between periods, was $25 million, or $0.16 per diluted share for the same period. The adjusted income from continuing operations excludes the following primary after-tax items: a $106 million non-cash mark-to-market loss on crude oil derivatives and a $25 million loss on extinguishment of debt. Details for fourth quarter results can be found in the attached schedules. 

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from continuing operations attributable to Murphy was $404 million, or $22.94 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) sold. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and exploration expenses (EBITDAX) from continuing operations attributable to Murphy was $424 million, or $24.05 per BOE sold. Details for fourth quarter EBITDA and EBITDAX reconciliations can be found in the attached schedules.

Fourth quarter production averaged 194 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOEPD) with 59 percent oil and 67 percent liquids. Production was impacted by total unplanned downtime of 8 MBOEPD for the quarter. Non-operated, unplanned downtime was 1,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOEPD) across various fields in the Gulf of Mexico and 1,000 BOEPD at Terra Nova in offshore Canada.

Operated unplanned downtime of 1,500 BOEPD in the Gulf of Mexico was primarily due to a subsea equipment malfunction at Neidermeyer (Mississippi Canyon 209), causing a five-day impact on the three-well field. One well remains down during equipment repairs, which are expected to be complete by second quarter 2020.

2

Operated production variances of 3,600 BOEPD in the Eagle Ford Shale were the result of well workover activity on higher rate wells in Catarina, as well as new East Tilden wells outperforming historical Tilden wells but producing below their corporate forecast for the quarter. The majority of the Catarina workovers were complete by the end of fourth quarter 2019 and are currently producing in line with expectations. Details for fourth quarter production can be found in the attached schedules.

FULL YEAR 2019 RESULTS

The company recorded net income, attributable to Murphy, of $1.1 billion, or $6.98 per diluted share, for the full year 2019. The company reported adjusted income, which excludes both the results of discontinued operations and certain other items that affect comparability of results between periods, of $144 million, or $0.87 per diluted share. Details for full year 2019 results can be found in the attached schedules. 

Production for the full year averaged 173 MBOEPD and consisted of 60 percent oil and 67 percent liquids volumes. Details for 2019 production can be found in the attached tables.

“Over the course of 2019, we executed two noteworthy transactions as we continued to strategically transform our asset base. Our new portfolio generated strong net income in 2019, supported by increased oil production and positive differentials to West Texas Intermediate oil pricing. This growth led to additional cash flow generation which, in addition to proceeds from the sale of Malaysia, allowed us to return more than $660 million to shareholders through share repurchases and a competitive dividend,” stated Roger W. Jenkins, President and Chief Executive Officer.

FINANCIAL POSITION

In the fourth quarter, Murphy issued $550 million of 5.875 percent senior notes due 2027. Proceeds were used to redeem approximately $240 million of the 4.0 percent senior notes due 2022 and $281 million of the 3.7 percent notes due 2022. 

The company had $2.8 billion of outstanding long-term, fixed-rate notes at the end of fourth quarter 2019. The fixed-rate notes had a weighted average maturity of 7.7 years and a weighted average coupon of 5.8 percent.

3

As previously announced, Murphy completed its $500 million share repurchase program. The remaining $94 million under the authorization was used to repurchase 4.3 million shares in the fourth quarter. Over the course of the year, Murphy reduced its outstanding shares by approximately 12 percent, or 20.7 million shares, from 173.6 million shares as of April 30 to 152.9 million shares outstanding at completion of the program on October 4, 2019.

As of December 31, 2019, Murphy had approximately $1.9 billion of liquidity, comprised of a fully undrawn $1.6 billion senior unsecured credit facility and approximately $307 million of cash and cash equivalents.

YEAR-END 2019 PROVED RESERVES 

Murphy’s preliminary year-end 2019 proved reserves were 800 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE), consisting of 50 percent oil and 57 percent liquids. Total proved reserves were 2 percent lower than at year-end 2018 as a result of the Malaysia divestiture and 2019 production, which were largely offset by the Gulf of Mexico acquisition, improvements to reserves from revisions and extensions across the business. Excluding Malaysia proved reserves of 129 MMBOE at year-end 2018, Murphy increased its proved reserves by 17 percent in 2019.

The company achieved organic reserve replacement of 172 percent with a three-year total finding and development cost of $12.95 per BOE.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

“With the transition out of Malaysia, increasing our Gulf of Mexico business, and continued investment in our onshore businesses, we have been able to maintain a sizeable asset base - all while maintaining our liquids weighting at 57 percent. I am also pleased with an increase in our proved developed reserves to 57 percent from 50 percent and our competitive three-year total finding and developing cost metric of $12.95 per BOE,” stated Jenkins.

SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR-END

Murphy has entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC (ArcLight), a Boston-based energy infrastructure investment manager, regarding Murphy’s 50 percent interest in the King’s Quay floating production system (King’s Quay FPS) in the Gulf of Mexico.

Under the terms of the MOU, Murphy and an affiliate of ArcLight will negotiate definitive agreements detailing the assumption of certain future capital requirements with respect to the King’s Quay FPS and associated export pipelines construction, ownership and operation, as well as the reimbursement of Murphy’s previous capital outlay, including approximately $125 million spent in 2019. The remaining 50 percent of the King’s Quay FPS will continue to be owned by Ridgewood King’s Quay, LLC and ILX Prospect King’s Quay, LLC, both of which are managed by Ridgewood Energy Corporation.

The King’s Quay FPS is scheduled to go into service in mid-2022, with Murphy serving as operator. Designed to process up to 80 thousand barrels of oil per day and up to 100 million cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Khaleesi / Mormont and Samurai fields, the facility will be located in Green Canyon Block 433.

Closing of the transaction is anticipated in late first to early second quarter 2020, with funds received to be held for general corporate purposes.

2020 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND PRODUCTION GUIDANCE

Murphy is planning 2020 capital expenditures (CAPEX) to be in the range of $1.4 to $1.5 billion with full year 2020 production to be in the range of 190 to 202 MBOEPD. Production for first quarter 2020 is estimated to be in the range of 181 to 193 MBOEPD, impacted by approximately 3 MBOEPD due to Terra Nova being offline. Both production and CAPEX guidance ranges exclude Gulf of Mexico noncontrolling interest (NCI). Murphy’s 2020 plan reflects management’s continued focus on spending within cash flows, generating excess funds such that the company returns cash to shareholders through the longstanding dividend.

The table below illustrates the capital allocation by area.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2020, Murphy plans to spend $680 million in the Eagle Ford Shale, representing a 13 percent increase from 2019. This capital includes $515 million for drilling 91 and bringing online 97 operated wells, primarily in the company’s Karnes and Catarina acreage, as well as drilling 46 and bringing online 59 non-operated wells during the year in Karnes and Tilden. Murphy’s Eagle Ford Shale budget also includes $165 million for field development.

7

The company has also allocated $175 million to its Canada onshore business in the Kaybob Duvernay, Tupper Montney and Placid Montney, which is 38 percent lower than in 2019. Approximately $125 million is allocated to the Kaybob Duvernay, primarily for lease retention to bring online 16 operated wells, with $35 million allocated to the Tupper Montney to bring online five operated wells and $15 million allocated to Placid Montney to bring online 11 non-operated wells.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

North American onshore production for 2020 is forecast to increase to approximately 105 MBOEPD. Annual average production in the Eagle Ford Shale is expected to grow to 50 MBOEPD, while the Kaybob Duvernay is planned to remain flat at 10 MBOEPD. Tupper Montney production is forecast at approximately 43 MBOEPD.

Murphy has allocated approximately $480 million, or 33 percent, of capital to its offshore assets, with 30 percent planned for the Gulf of Mexico and the remaining 3 percent for Canada offshore. Gulf of Mexico capital will be used for both development drilling and field development projects, including the three-well rig program at Front Runner, activities related to the Khaleesi / Mormont and Samurai developments, St. Malo waterflood, planned well workovers and various non-operated projects. The Cascade #4 well (Walker Ridge 250) workover is scheduled to be complete and placed online in the first half of 2020, as well as the Dalmatian 134 #2 well (Desoto Canyon 134). Canada offshore spending is budgeted for development drilling.

The company forecasts total 2020 offshore production volumes to average 91 MBOEPD, with Gulf of Mexico production of 86 MBOEPD. Canada offshore production is forecast at 4 MBOEPD with the assumption that non-operated Terra Nova remains offline throughout the year for drydock repairs and safety equipment updates, impacting Murphy by approximately 2 MBOEPD in 2020.

8

Approximately $100 million is allocated to a four-well exploration program in 2020, with 40 percent for drilling, 15 percent for geological and geophysical studies, and the remainder for lease amortization and other exploration costs. Other capital of approximately $20 million, or 1 percent of budget, supports corporate activities. 

“Murphy has again established a capital budget that is focused on spending within free cash flow and covering our longstanding quarterly dividend. We are strategically allocating capital to high returning, oil-weighted projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Eagle Ford Shale that in turn drive a stronger production foundation for long-term cash flow generation,” stated Jenkins.

Detailed guidance for the first quarter and full year 2020 is contained in the following schedule.
