        "So for example, in NIPT, we have the VeriSeq NIPT CE-IVD product outside the U.S. that is absolutely sample-to-answer all the way from upfront automation to report. We've talked about the fact that we're bringing back to the U.S. now with TruSight NIPT and TSO 500 is like that too. And then we just announced the TruSight software in the genetic disease space. And again, that's end-to-end, right, so you have the DNA PCR fee upfront, NovaSeq, you have the software. So in genetic disease, some areas of oncology NIPT, we are providing end-to-end. But for the vast majority of markets, we're going to look to partners and say, look, we want people that are true experts in their domain. And there are dozens, if not hundreds of domains. And we don't want to try and be the expert in all of them."
