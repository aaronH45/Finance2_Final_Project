  ITEM 7.01.   Regulation FD Disclosure    

Following discussions with investors, E*TRADE Financial Corporation (the “Company”) has become aware of a perception that the Company’s change in control arrangements with its executives (“CiC Arrangements”) do not provide appropriate incentives in the event of a change in control. The Board and its Compensation Committee have reviewed the CiC Arrangements with the input of the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant, who benchmarked severance practices of the Company's peers. While the CiC Arrangements were within the range of practices of its peer group, the Board and its Compensation Committee determined to enhance the CiC Arrangements in response to investor input. The Board and its Compensation Committee sought to do so in a manner that compares reasonably to the Company’s peer group and remains within the guidance established by leading institutional investors and advisory firms. 

The information appearing in this Item 7.01 shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or incorporated by reference into any filing thereunder or under the Securities Act of 1933 unless expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. This report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information in the report that is required to be disclosed solely by Regulation FD. 

  ITEM 5.02.   Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers    

On January 16, 2020, the Company adopted a policy applicable to Michael Pizzi (Chief Executive Officer), Chad Turner (Chief Financial Officer) and each of the executives expected to be a “named executive officer” for purposes of the Company’s 2020 annual proxy statement providing that if the executive incurs an involuntary termination following a change in control, then the executive would receive an amount equal to 2.99 times the sum of the executive’s (a) annual base salary and (b) annual target cash bonus. Consistent with existing compensation arrangements, the executive would also receive a pro-rated cash bonus in the year of termination following a change in control and the equity awards held by the executives would continue to accelerate or be delivered in accordance with the applicable respective equity grant agreements.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
