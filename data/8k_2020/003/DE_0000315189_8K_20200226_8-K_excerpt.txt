On February 26, 2020, the shareholders of Deere & Company (“Company”) approved the John Deere 2020 Equity and Incentive Plan (“Plan”) at the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The Company’s shareholders approved the Plan in accordance with the voting results set forth below under Item 5.07. 

The material terms of the Plan were described in the Company’s definitive Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 10, 2020 (“Proxy Statement”) under the caption “Item 4 – Approve the John Deere 2020 Equity and Incentive Plan,” and the full text of the Plan was filed as an appendix thereto. 

The Plan allows us to grant our salaried employees a range of compensation awards based on or related to Deere common stock, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and stock units, performances shares and performance units, cash equivalent awards and substitute awards. 

The total number of shares that may be issued under the Plan is the sum of (i) 11,608,061 new shares, plus (ii) the number of shares previously authorized for awards under the prior plan but not reserved for outstanding awards, plus (iii) any shares corresponding to awards under the Plan and the prior plan that are forfeited after the approval date. The Plan is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2030. 

The above description of the Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan set forth as Appendix C to the Proxy Statement and is incorporated herein by reference. 

 Item 5.03Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year. 

 (a)Amendment to Bylaws 

On February 26, 2020, shareholders approved an amendment to the Company’s bylaws, effective immediately (the “Bylaw Amendment”). The amendment provides that courts located within the State of Delaware will serve as the exclusive forum for the adjudication of certain legal actions related to intra-corporate disputes involving the Company. The amendment does not apply to suits, including derivative actions, to enforce duties or liabilities created by the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Under the amendment, the Company retains the ability to consent to an alternative forum when its’ interests and those of shareholders are best served by permitting the dispute to proceed in a forum other than Delaware. 

The foregoing description of the Company’s bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the amended bylaws, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
