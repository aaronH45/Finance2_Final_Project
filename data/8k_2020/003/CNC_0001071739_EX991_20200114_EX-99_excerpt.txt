(NYSE:WCG) (“WellCare”) for up to $1,950,000,000 aggregate principal amount of new notes to be issued by Centene (the “Centene Notes”) and cash and the related consent solicitations (the “Consent Solicitations”) being made by Centene on behalf of WellCare to adopt certain proposed amendments (the “Amendments”) to the indentures governing the WellCare Notes. Centene hereby extends such expiration date from 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 14, 2020, to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 21, 2020 (as the same may be further extended, the “Expiration Date”).

On November 14, 2019, requisite consents were received and supplemental indentures were executed, eliminating substantially all restrictive covenants and certain events of default and other provisions in each of the indentures governing the WellCare Notes. Such supplemental indentures will only become operative upon the settlement date of the Exchange Offers.

The Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations are being made pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the confidential offering memorandum and consent solicitation statement dated November 1, 2019, as amended on November 12, 2019 and the related letter of transmittal and consent hereby, each as amended by the press releases dated December 2, 2019, December 18, 2019 and January 8, 2020 and as amended hereby, and are conditioned upon the closing of Centene’s acquisition of WellCare (the “Merger”), which condition may not be waived by Centene, and certain other conditions that may be waived by Centene.

The settlement date for the Exchange Offers is expected to occur promptly after the Expiration Date and immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, which is expected to occur by the first half of 2020. As a result, the Expiration Date may be further extended one or more times. Centene will provide notice of any such extension in advance of the Expiration Date.

Except as described in this press release, all other terms of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations remain unchanged.
