WEST PALM BEACH, FL, February 3, 2020 — Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE: AMG) today reported its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019.

Jay C. Horgen, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMG, said:

“AMG reported Economic earnings per share of $4.52 and year-over-year EBITDA growth of 5%, reflecting strong Affiliate investment performance and related performance fees. Net client cash flows of ($11.3) billion were driven primarily by certain quantitative strategies and seasonal client redemptions. During the quarter, AMG and certain Affiliates implemented a number of strategic repositioning initiatives to reallocate resources to areas of higher growth and return.

"Looking ahead, we are well-positioned to generate growth over time, given our Affiliates’ strong long-term performance records — particularly in fundamental and relative value strategies — along with their business momentum in growing areas such as private markets, wealth management, and fixed income. In addition, we continue to invest in growth opportunities and are advancing discussions with prospective Affiliates operating in areas of strong client demand. Through the disciplined execution of our growth strategy, along with our commitment to returning excess capital to shareholders, we are confident in our ability to create long-term shareholder value.”

Notes

(1) As supplemental information, we provide non-GAAP performance measures of Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest), Economic net income (controlling interest) and Economic earnings per share. Management utilizes these non-GAAP performance measures to assess our performance before our share of certain non-cash expenses and to improve comparability between periods. 

Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) represents our performance before our share of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments, and adjustments to our contingent payment arrangements. We believe that many investors use this non-GAAP measure when assessing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry.

Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of pre-tax intangible amortization and impairments (including the portion attributable to equity method investments in Affiliates), deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items which include non-cash imputed interest (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expenses. Economic net income (controlling interest) is used by management and our Board of Directors as our principal performance benchmark, including as a measure for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value. 

Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our junior convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of the junior convertible securities in excess of par, if any, are deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted):

These non-GAAP performance measures are provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest), Earnings per share (controlling interest) or other GAAP performance measures. For additional information on our non-GAAP measures, see our Annual and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, respectively, which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
