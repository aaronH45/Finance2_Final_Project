The Company announced that Keith Block has resigned from his positions as the Company’s Co-Chief Executive Officer and as a director of the Company.

The Company has entered into an agreement (the “Transition Agreement”) with Mr. Block setting forth the terms of Mr. Block’s transition from the Company. Mr. Block will serve as Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer during the Transition Period. The Transition Period may be terminated earlier by the Company for cause, as defined in the Transition Agreement, by Mr. Block for any reason upon ten days’ written notice, and the Transition Agreement provides for automatic termination upon Mr. Block’s acceptance of employment or other full-time services with a third party.

Mr. Block will be entitled to receive his bonus for fiscal 2020 calculated and payable in the ordinary course. During the Transition Period, previously granted equity awards will continue to vest in accordance with their terms. The Transition Agreement provides for a customary release of claims by Mr. Block and reaffirmation of his obligations under an employee inventions and proprietary rights assignment agreement.
