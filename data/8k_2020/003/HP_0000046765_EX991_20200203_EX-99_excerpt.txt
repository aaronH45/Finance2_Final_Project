NEWS RELEASE

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: February 3, 2020

HELMERICH & PAYNE, INC. ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

•Quarterly U.S. Land revenue decreased $36 million to $509 million sequentially, while operating gross margins(1) decreased by $7 million to $182 million sequentially; revenue days decreased 6% to 17,684 from 18,765 in the prior quarter

•Both quarterly U.S. Land adjusted average rig revenue of $25,397(2) per day and U.S Land adjusted average rig margin of $10,410(2) per day were roughly flat sequentially

•H&P's drilling automation technology, AutoSlideSM, has been commercially deployed in six U.S. shale basins, and has drilled over 150 wells and 2.6 million feet

•Approximately 10% of the Company’s active U.S. FlexRig® fleet operated under non-traditional dayrate contracts during the quarter

•On December 13, 2019, Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.71 per share

•In 2020, the Company is celebrating its Centennial Anniversary and over 60 years as a public company

Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (NYSE: HP) reported income of $31 million or $0.27 per diluted share from operating revenues of $615 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, compared to net income of $41 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, on revenues of $649 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. The net income per diluted share for the first fiscal quarter of 2020 and the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019 include $0.14 and $(0.01), respectively, of after-tax gains and losses comprised of select items(3). For the first fiscal quarter, select items(3) were comprised of:

•$0.15 of after-tax gains pertaining to gains on sales and a net mark-to-market gain related to our equity investments

Net cash provided by operating activities was $112 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $196 million for the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2019. The timing of certain accruals and payments and a seasonal slowdown in receivable collections combined with modestly lower activity contributed to the sequential decline in operating cash flow.

 President and CEO John Lindsay commented, “As we look back on the challenges the industry experienced in 2019, our leadership position and performance continued to demonstrate our ability to deliver value while adapting to rapidly changing market conditions. This quarter's results reflect the momentum of those successes. 

 “H&P continued to gain market share during the quarter while the overall industry rig count declined. This is indicative of the growing preference for super-spec(4) rigs and the performance these rigs deliver relative to legacy SCR rigs, which still represented roughly 15% of the unconventional activity at calendar year-end. We believe this replacement trend will persist as our super-spec FlexRig fleet's performance and efficiency gains create value for our customers. 

 "H&P remains committed to developing new pricing models that enable us to share in an equitable portion of the value created. While performance and commodity-based contracts made up 10% of our U.S. contract mix during the first fiscal quarter, today we have approximately 15% of our active U.S. FlexRig fleet contracted under non-traditional dayrate contracts, the majority of which are performance-based contracts. 

 “We are encouraged as we head into fiscal 2020. For the first time in four quarters our ending rig count was sequentially higher than the previous quarter's ending rig count. We believe capital discipline by our customers will remain a prevailing theme and we expect industry activity to look similar to the average level experienced during the second half of calendar 2019, which implies a modest increase from current levels.

 “Our H&P Technologies (HPT) segment solutions continue to gain momentum with customers, particularly AutoSlide, our software that automatically controls the rig to execute steering of the well with a simple press of a button. To date, AutoSlide's deployment count is more than 150 wells, executing the drilling of the vertical, curve and horizontal wellbore totaling over 2.6 million feet. Customers using AutoSlide are seeing significant benefits from wellbore quality and placement in the forms of efficiency, predictability, and risk mitigation that only automation can provide. 

 "The power of predictability in performance has enabled our customers to optimize completion stages, increase contact with the reservoir in ways that are better for life of the well, and push the envelope on new methods and techniques that ultimately lead to production increases. We believe these advantages are improving well economics, capital certainty and becoming overriding factors for increasing adoption of our software solutions. 

 “Turning to our international operations, we remain optimistic about the opportunities we are seeing in the Middle East. Our rigs in the Middle East are now fully utilized and prospects for further growth will likely result in exporting additional FlexRig drilling rigs from the U.S. In Argentina, the Company has a strong market presence in the Vaca Muerta, and economic concerns notwithstanding, we continue to believe this world-class resource play remains an attractive area for further industry activity in the future.”

 Senior Vice President and CFO Mark Smith also commented, "As we move into calendar 2020, we remain confident that our balance sheet strength and level of free cash flow generation will allow us to maintain industry leading returns to stockholders and have ample flexibility to take advantage of additional investment opportunities should they develop. H&P's cash flow from operations during the first fiscal quarter was impacted by several seasonal and one-time events. We expect it to be higher in the remaining quarters of the fiscal year. Our fiscal 2020 capex budget remains in the range we initially set, which is between $275 and $300 million.”

 John Lindsay concluded, “The year 2020 is momentous for the Company as it is our centennial year. In keeping with this milestone, we remain focused on maintaining our position as the industry's most trusted partner in drilling productivity and technological innovation. H&P's unmatched expertise, experience and people are the linchpin of our leadership position as a drilling solutions provider. Along with our exceptional workforce, our best-in-class FlexRig fleet, balance sheet and leading-edge digital technology, we continue to enable well economics and returns that have strengthened our customer commitment of achieving shared, long-term success.”

Operating Segment Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2020

U.S. Land Operations:

Segment operating income decreased $2.6 million to $56.7 million sequentially. The decrease in operating results was primarily attributable to a decline in revenue days, which decreased by approximately 6% sequentially. 

Adjusted average rig revenue per day increased slightly by $32 to $25,397(2) largely due to an increase in our FlexServices (trucking, casing running, rental equipment) during the quarter. The adjusted average rig expense per day increased sequentially by $53 to $14,987(2). Corresponding adjusted average rig margin per day decreased $21, less than half of a percent, to $10,410(2). 

The segment’s depreciation expense for the quarter includes non-cash charges of $1.3 million for abandonments and accelerated depreciation related to used drilling rig components related to rig upgrades and scrapping of idle equipment, compared to similar non-cash charges of $4.6 million during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019.

International Land Operations:

Segment operating income increased by $7.3 million to $3.1 million sequentially. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to higher average margins per day and a foreign currency gain. Prior quarter results included a $3.5 million foreign currency loss related to our Argentina operations compared to an approximate $0.7 million foreign currency gain in the first fiscal quarter. Revenue days increased during the quarter by 1% to 1,619 while the average rig margin per day increased by $1,731 to $7,208.

Offshore Operations:

Segment operating income increased by $3.5 million to $6.3 million sequentially. The number of quarterly revenue days on H&P-owned platform rigs was relatively flat sequentially at 550, while the average rig margin per day increased sequentially by $5,777 to $13,237 due to unexpected repair down time that adversely impacted prior quarter results. Segment operating income from management contracts on customer-owned platform rigs contributed approximately $2.9 million, compared to approximately $2.2 million during the prior quarter.

H&P Technologies:

The segment had an operating loss of $4.6 million compared to income of $0.6 million during the previous quarter. Prior quarter results benefited from a change in the fair value of a contingent liability. Excluding this benefit, HPT's operating loss decreased by $3.7 million sequentially. The sequential decrease in the operating loss was due primarily to higher revenues. 

Operational Outlook for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2020

U.S. Land Operations:

•Quarterly revenue days expected to be flat-to-up 1.5% sequentially, representing a roughly 1%-3% increase in the average number of active rigs given the lower number of calendar days in the second fiscal quarter; we expect to exit the quarter at between 193-203 active rigs

•Average rig revenue per day expected to be relatively flat sequentially and in the range of $25,000-$25,500 (excluding any impact from early termination revenue) 

•Average rig expense per day expected to be between $14,650-$15,150

International Land Operations:

•Quarterly revenue days expected to decrease roughly 7% sequentially, representing an average rig count of approximately 16-17 rigs for the quarter

•Average rig margin per day expected to decrease to $6,000-$7,000

February 3, 2020

Offshore Operations:

•Quarterly revenue days expected to decrease by approximately 30% sequentially, representing an average rig count of 4-5 rigs for the quarter, as one rig demobilized to the yard and one rig transitions between customers

•Despite recent rate increases, the average rig margin per day is expected to decrease to $10,000-$11,000 due to the aforementioned rig demobilization and transition 

•Management contracts expected to generate approximately $2 million in operating income

HP Technologies:

•Fiscal second quarter revenue is expected to be between $16-$19 million, roughly flat sequentially

Other Estimates for Fiscal 2020

•Gross capital expenditures are still expected to be approximately $275 to $300 million; 57-62% expected for maintenance, 17-19% expected for tubular purchases, 11-15% for walking conversions, and roughly 10% for corporate and information technology projects. Asset sales include reimbursements for lost and damaged tubulars and sales of other used drilling equipment that offset a portion of the gross capital expenditures and are expected to total $35 to $45 million in fiscal 2020.

•General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 are still expected to be approximately $200 million

•Depreciation is still expected to be approximately $540 million

Select Items Included in Net Income per Diluted Share

 Segment operating income for all segments is a non-GAAP financial measure of the Company’s performance, as it excludes gain on sale of assets, corporate selling, general and administrative expenses and corporate depreciation. The Company considers segment operating income to be an important supplemental measure of operating performance for presenting trends in the Company’s core businesses. This measure is used by the Company to facilitate period-to-period comparisons in operating performance of the Company’s reportable segments in the aggregate by eliminating items that affect comparability between periods. The Company believes that segment operating income is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the segments and the Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers. Additionally, it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons. However, segment operating income has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income or loss, a performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as it excludes certain costs that may affect the Company’s operating performance in future periods.

 The following table reconciles operating income (loss) per the information above to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
