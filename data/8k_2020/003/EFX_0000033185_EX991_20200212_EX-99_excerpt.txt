Begor, Chief Executive Officer of Equifax. “2019 was a transition year for Equifax as we move back to a more normal growth mode. We made significant progress during the year on our multi-year, $1.25 billion EFX2020 cloud technology transformation including the ongoing migration of our data, analytics, and application infrastructure to cloud native technology, which will accelerate the speed at which we innovate and grow while continuing to strengthen our data security. We also took strong steps to expand our access to unique, differentiated data and our collaboration with our customers and partners to deliver advanced decisioning and data solutions that help them more effectively grow and manage their business.”

Financial Results Summary

The Company reported revenue of $905.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an 8 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2018 and a 10 percent increase in local currency.

2020 First Quarter and Full Year Guidance

•For the first quarter of 2020, we expect reported revenue to be between $915 and $930 million, reflecting local currency growth as compared to the first quarter of 2019 of 9% to 11%, offset by an expected over 1% negative impact of foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.29 and $1.34 per share. The impact of foreign exchange on adjusted EPS compared to the first quarter of 2019 is expected to be a negative impact of less than $0.01 per share. Impacting first quarter 2020 revenue and adjusted EPS is an expectation of a 21% increase in U.S. mortgage market inquiries impacting our USIS and EWS units.

•We expect full year 2020 reported revenue to be between $3.650 and $3.750 billion, reflecting local currency growth as compared to 2019 of 4% and 7%, offset by an expected less than 1% negative impact of foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $5.60 and $5.80 per share. The impact of foreign exchange on adjusted EPS compared to full year 2019 is expected to be a negative impact of $0.03 per share. U.S. mortgage market inquiries are expected to be approximately flat in 2020 versus 2019, with strong growth in inquiries in the first half of 2020, offset by a decline in inquiries in the second half of 2020.

Common Questions & Answers (Unaudited)

(Dollars in millions)

1. Can you provide a further analysis of operating revenue for the fourth quarter and adjusted revenue for the full year by operating segment?

Operating and adjusted revenue consists of the following components:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Reflects percentage change in revenue conforming 2019 results using 2018 exchange rates.

**Adjusted revenue is defined as GAAP revenue adjusted for a charge related to settlements with commercial customers. See Non-GAAP reconciliation D for a reconciliation of operating revenue to adjusted revenue.

2. What drove the fluctuation in the effective tax rate?

Our effective income tax rate was 54.8% for the three months ended December 31, 2019 due to the permanent tax differences resulting from the accrual for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was a tax benefit of 6.9%. The fourth quarter 2018 benefit was a result of adjustments recorded during the quarter to the provisional amounts recorded for the Tax Act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 that more than offset the income tax expense recorded during the quarter.

Our effective tax rate was 9.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, down from 14.0% for the same period in 2018. Our effective tax rate is lower for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 due to the operating loss of the Company in 2019 and permanent tax differences resulting from the accrual for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident.

3. What is the breakdown of costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident?

Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident are defined as incremental costs to transform our information technology infrastructure and data security; legal fees and professional services costs to investigate the 2017 cybersecurity incident and respond to legal, government and regulatory claims; as well as costs to provide the free product and related support to the consumer. Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident do not include the accrual for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, as further described in the Notes to the reconciliations of this release.

In the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded expenses, net of directors and officers insurance recoveries, of $99.6 million and $800.9 million, respectively, for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, exclusive of our legal and professional services expenses. While it is reasonably possible that losses exceeding the amount accrued will be incurred, it is not possible at this time to estimate the additional possible loss in excess of the amount already accrued that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident based on a number of factors, such as the various stages of these proceedings and investigations, that alleged damages have not been specified or are uncertain, the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class, as applicable, and the lack of resolution on significant factual and legal issues. The ultimate amount paid on these actions, claims and investigations in excess of the amount already accrued could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods.

We recorded $181.6 million ($147.0 million, net of tax), and $1,138.2 million ($938.4 million, net of tax) for the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, for expenses, net of insurance, related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. For the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $104.6 million ($76.8 million, net of tax), and $326.2 million ($243.9 million, net of tax), respectively, for expenses, net of insurance, related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. The components of the costs are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The $75.9 million and $292.1 million of technology and data security costs include incremental costs to transform our technology infrastructure and improve application, network, data security, and the costs of development and launch of Lock and Alert™. These include, but are not limited to, costs for people, professional and contracted services, technical services and products, and other costs added either directly or indirectly to manage, execute, and support the implementation of these plans. The $6.1 million and $41.3 million of legal and investigative fees include legal fees and professional services costs to investigate the 2017 cybersecurity incident and respond to legal, government, and regulatory investigations and claims related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. We did not record any product liability costs in the fourth quarter of 2019. The $3.9 

11

million of product liability costs in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 include the expected costs of fulfillment of TrustedID® Premier and support of consumers using TrustedID® Premier. Additionally, in 2018, the Company extended the free credit file monitoring services for impacted consumers using the free TrustedID® Premier service by providing them the opportunity to enroll in Experian® IDNotify™ at no cost for an additional twelve months.

Since the announcement of the cybersecurity incident in September 2017, we have incurred a total of $1,703.4 million of costs related to the incident, incremental technology and data security costs, and expenses, net of insurance recoveries, for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident.

We expect 2017 cybersecurity incident related costs for 2020 to be less than the levels incurred in 2019. Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident do not include the accrual for legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, as further described in the Notes to the reconciliations of this release.

At the time of the 2017 cybersecurity incident, we had $125.0 million of cybersecurity insurance coverage, above a $7.5 million deductible, to limit our exposure to losses such as those related to this incident. Since the announcement of the 2017 cybersecurity incident, we have received the maximum reimbursement under the insurance policy of $125.0 million, all of which was received prior to 2019. We also maintained a directors and officers insurance policy of which we have recorded our estimated maximum recoveries as of December 31, 2019.

(1)During the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $35.3 million ($30.0 million net of tax). We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the significant cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. The $5.3 million of tax is comprised of $9.3 million of tax expense net of $4.0 million of a cash income tax benefit. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $34.9 million ($29.9 million net of tax). The $5.0 million of tax is comprised of $9.0 million of tax expense net of $4.0 million of a cash income tax benefit. 

For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $140.2 million ($119.4 million net of tax). The $20.8 million of tax is comprised of $36.9 million of tax expense net of

(7)Argentina experienced multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the peso, and increasing borrowing rates. As such, Argentina has been deemed a highly inflationary economy by accounting policymakers. During the fourth quarter of 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a foreign currency loss of $0.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to the impact of remeasuring the peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities as a result of Argentina being a highly inflationary economy.

Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures

Acquisition-related amortization expense, net of tax - During the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $35.3 million ($30.0 million net of tax). For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $140.2 million ($119.4 million net of tax).

We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the significant cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management believes excluding the impact of amortization expense is useful because excluding acquisition-related amortization, and other items that are not comparable, allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Certain acquired intangibles result in significant cash income tax savings which are not reflected in earnings. Management believes that including a benefit to reflect the cash income tax savings is useful as it allows investors to better value Equifax. Management makes these adjustments to earnings when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. 

Accrual for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident - During the fourth quarter of 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded expenses, net of directors and officers insurance recoveries, of $99.6 million ($83.5 million, net of tax) and $800.9 million ($686.1 million, net of tax) for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, exclusive of our legal professional services expenses. While it is reasonably possible that losses exceeding the amount accrued will be incurred, it is not possible at this time to estimate the additional possible loss in excess of the amount already accrued that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. The ultimate amount paid on these actions, claims and investigations in excess of the amount already accrued could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, since a charge of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident - During the third quarter of 2017, we reported that we were the target of a cybersecurity incident. We recorded $82.0 million ($63.5 million, net of tax) and $337.3 million ($252.3 million, net of tax) during the fourth quarter of 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, and $104.6 million ($76.8 million, net of tax) and $326.2 million ($243.9 million, net of tax) during the fourth quarter of 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively, for costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident are defined as incremental costs to transform our information technology infrastructure and data security; legal fees and professional services costs to investigate the 2017 cybersecurity incident and respond to legal, government and regulatory claims; as well as costs to provide the free credit monitoring product and related support to the consumer. Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident do not include the above accrual for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. Management believes excluding these charges is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Settlements with commercial customers - During the third quarter of 2019, we recorded a $20.0 million ($15.1 million, net of tax) charge to revenue related to settlements with commercial customers. Management believes this adjustment to revenue provides meaningful information regarding our revenue and provides a basis to compare revenue between periods and to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. Management considers these adjustments when assessing historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Charge related to the realignment of internal resources and other costs - During the first quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded $11.5 million ($8.8 million, net of tax) and $46.1 million ($35.0 million, net of tax), respectively, of restructuring charges for the realignment of internal resources and other costs, which predominantly relates to the reduction of headcount and the realignment of our internal resources to support the Company’s strategic objectives. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, since a charge of such amount is not comparable among the periods. 

21

This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

PayNet acquisition related amounts for transaction expenses incurred as a direct result of the acquisition - During the second quarter of 2019, we recorded $6.3 million ($4.8 million, net of tax) for PayNet acquisition related amounts other than acquisition-related amortization which was primarily related to transaction costs resulting from the acquisition and was recorded in operating income. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, since a charge of such amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods.

Argentina highly inflationary foreign currency adjustment - Argentina experienced multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the peso, and increasing borrowing rates. As such, Argentina has been deemed a highly inflationary economy by accounting policymakers. During the fourth quarter of 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a foreign currency loss of $0.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to the impact of remeasuring the peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities as a result of Argentina being a highly inflationary economy. During the fourth quarter of 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a foreign currency loss of $0.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Income tax effects of stock awards that are recognized upon vesting or settlement - During the fourth quarter of 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded tax expense of $1.1 million and tax benefit of $3.0 million, respectively, related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs. During the fourth quarter of 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of $0.5 million and $7.5 million, respectively. Management believes excluding this tax effect from financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the corresponding period in 2018, because this amount is non-operating and relates to income tax benefits or deficiencies for stock awards recognized when tax amounts differ from recognized stock compensation cost. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Legal settlement unrelated to the 2017 cybersecurity incident - During the third quarter of 2018, we recorded an $18.5 million ($14.1 million, net of tax) charge for a legal settlement that was not related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018, since a charge of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Adjustments for uncertain tax positions - For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of $14.1 million related to adjustments from uncertain tax positions resulting from the completion of examinations of historical tax returns. Management believes excluding this tax effect from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018, since a charge of such amount for 2018 is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax’s historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.

Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin - Management defines adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income attributable to Equifax plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes certain one-time items. Management believes the use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis.

Adjusted revenue - Management defines adjusted revenue as GAAP revenue adjusted for certain non-recurring items such as a charge related to settlements with commercial customers. Management believes the use of adjusted revenue allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis.
