Booking Holdings' guidance for the 1st quarter

The coronavirus has had a significant and negative impact across our business during the 1st quarter. It is not possible to predict where, and to what degree, outbreaks of the coronavirus will disrupt travel patterns. The guidance for the 1st quarter is based on the trends observed in the quarter so far and considers the continued negative impact of the coronavirus. The guidance ranges for the 1st quarter are wider than typically provided given the high level of uncertainty in forecasting the coronavirus and its associated impact on the Company and the travel industry generally. While it is extremely difficult to forecast results, these guidance ranges represent the Company's current estimates of 1st quarter results based on currently available data. 

Guidance for the 1st quarter is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-GAAP adjustments for amortization expense of intangible assets, non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and the tax impact of these non-GAAP adjustments are expected to increase non-GAAP net income over GAAP net income by approximately $45 million in the 1st quarter 2020, before considering the impact of unrealized gains or losses on marketable equity securities and foreign currency transaction gains or losses on our Euro-denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes, both of which are not predictable. 

Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is comprised of GAAP net income excluding depreciation and amortization expense, interest income, interest expense, unrealized gains and losses on marketable equity securities, foreign currency transaction gains or losses on our Euro-denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be higher than GAAP net income by approximately $230 million to $235 million in the 1st quarter of 2020, before considering the impact of unrealized gains or losses on marketable equity securities and foreign currency transaction gains or losses on our Euro-

denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes, both of which are not predictable. 

A full reconciliation of non-GAAP net income guidance, adjusted EBITDA guidance and non-GAAP net income per diluted share on a constant-currency basis guidance to GAAP net income and GAAP net income per diluted share is not provided because elements of the GAAP measures, such as foreign exchange rates and unrealized gains or losses on marketable equity securities, cannot be reliably predicted or estimated and could be significant. Accordingly, a full reconciliation cannot be given without unreasonable effort.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and include all normal and recurring adjustments that management of the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of its financial position and operating results.

To supplement the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: Non-GAAP total revenues, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share and free cash flow (net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures). The presentation of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.

The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a basis to evaluate performance and set targets for employee compensation programs. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate the Company's ongoing operating performance because they facilitate comparison of the Company's results for the current period and projected next-period results to those of prior periods and to those of its competitors (though other companies may calculate similar non-GAAP financial measures differently from those calculated by the Company). These non-GAAP financial measures, in particular adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and free cash flow are not intended to represent funds available for Booking Holdings' discretionary use and are not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flow from operations as measured under GAAP. The items excluded from these non-GAAP measures, but included in the calculation of their closest GAAP equivalent, are significant components of the Company's consolidated statements of operations and cash flows and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance.

Non-GAAP net income is net income with the following adjustments: 

•excludes the impact, if any, of significant charges or benefits associated with judgments, rulings, settlements and/or certain adjustments related to prior periods arising from travel transaction tax (e.g., hotel occupancy taxes, excise taxes, sales taxes, etc.) proceedings or other litigation or obligations,

•excludes the impact of certain loyalty program adjustments, such as the favorable $27 million adjustment to total revenues in the 1st quarter of 2018 related to changes introduced in that same quarter to OpenTable’s loyalty program,

•excludes a $66 million charge in the 2nd quarter of 2019 to correct an immaterial error related to the nonpayment of prior-period wage-related tax on compensation paid to certain highly-compensated former employees in the year of separation,

•excludes amortization expense of intangible assets, 

•excludes the impact, if any, of significant charges related to the impairment of goodwill or intangible assets,

•excludes non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, if any, related to our convertible debt, 

•excludes the impact, if any, of significant gains or losses on the sale of cost-method investments and significant charges related to other-than-temporary impairments of such investments, 

•excludes unrealized gains and losses on marketable equity securities, 

•excludes foreign currency transaction gains or losses on Euro-denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes,

3

•excludes income taxes related to convertible notes held for investment that matured in the 3rd quarter of 2019, and were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to income tax expense, 

•excludes the income tax impact related to one-time adjustments as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") enacted in December 2017, if any, and 

•the income tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments mentioned above.

In addition to the adjustments listed above regarding non-GAAP net income, adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation expense, interest income, interest expense and income tax expense.

We evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency by converting our current-year period results for transactions recorded in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates rather than the current-year period monthly average exchange rates.

The attached financial and statistical supplement includes reconciliations of our financial results under GAAP to non-GAAP financial information for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

(1) Amounts may not total due to rounding.

(2) Gross bookings is an operating and statistical metric that captures the total dollar value, generally inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services booked by our customers, net of cancellations.

(3) For periods ending prior to January 1, 2018, gross profit has been adjusted to reflect the reclassification of certain prior period expenses from "cost of revenues" to "sales and other expense" to conform to the current period presentation.

(4) For periods beginning after December 31, 2017, the Company records revenue under Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("Current Revenue Standard"), recognizing substantially all of its revenue at check-in, rather than at check-out, as it had in the past under the previous revenue accounting standard. Additionally, under the Current Revenue Standard, amounts remitted to travel service providers are recorded as a reduction to merchant revenues and therefore the Company no longer presents cost of revenues or gross profit.
