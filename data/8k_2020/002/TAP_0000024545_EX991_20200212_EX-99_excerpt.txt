DENVER & MONTREAL--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 12, 2020--Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE: TAP; TSX: TPX) today reported results for the 2019 full year and fourth quarter. Molson Coors president and chief executive officer Gavin Hattersley said:  

 "Full year 2019 was a challenging year for Molson Coors Beverage Company. However, despite significant headwinds and continued volume declines, we grew NSR/HL and improved our mix, delivered strong free cash flow and cost savings, reduced our debt, and started making progress toward premiumizing and modernizing our portfolio."  

 Gavin continued, "We know we have a lot of work still to do. That’s why last quarter we announced a plan to get Molson Coors back to consistent topline growth. The plan is designed to streamline the company, allow us to move faster, and free up resources to invest in our brands and capabilities. As promised in October, we’ve wasted no time in implementing the plan."

 Full Year Consolidated Highlights (versus 2018 Results)       Net Sales: $10.6 billion, decreased 1.8% and 0.6% in constant currency driven by volume declines in all segments, partially offset by net sales per hectoliter growth.     Net sales per hectoliter: $114.10 on a reported financial-volume basis, increased 2.4% and net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased by 2.9% in constant currency, primarily driven by positive global net pricing and mix benefiting from our continued focus on premiumizing our portfolio.     Volume: Worldwide brand volume of 88.9 million hectoliters decreased 3.5% due to lower volume in all segments primarily driven by challenging industry dynamics, particularly in the U.S. and Canada. Financial volume of 92.7 million hectoliters decreased 4.0%. Global priority brand volume decreased 2.2%.     Cost of goods sold (COGS) per hectoliter: on a reported basis, increased 0.9% primarily driven by inflation, volume deleverage, and negative mix, partially offset by lower unrealized mark-to-market losses on our commodity positions, cost savings and foreign currency movements.     Underlying COGS per hectoliter: increased 4.9% in constant currency primarily driven by the same factors as U.S. GAAP results excluding the impacts of the changes in unrealized mark-to-market positions and foreign currency movements.     U.S. GAAP net income attributable to MCBC: decreased 78.4%, largely driven by the impact of aggregate goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of approximately $692 million primarily related to our Canada reporting unit. The decrease was also due to lower volume, inflation, restructuring charges and one-time pension and postretirement costs, partially offset by positive global pricing, cost savings, lower incentive compensation, as well as lower interest expense.     Underlying net income: decreased 9.7%, primarily driven by the same factors as U.S. GAAP net income, excluding the impact of the aggregate goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and restructuring charges, as well as a higher underlying effective tax rate as compared to the prior year.     Underlying EBITDA: decreased 2.6% on a constant currency basis, largely driven by the same factors as underlying net income, with the exception of the impacts of interest and income tax expense.     U.S. GAAP cash from operations: net cash provided by operating activities for full year 2019 was approximately $1.9 billion, which represents a decrease of $434 million from the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by cycling the $328 million cash payment received in January 2018 related to a purchase price adjustment for our acquisition of the Miller International Business, as well as lower net income adjusted for non-cash add backs and higher cash paid for taxes, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital and lower interest paid.     Underlying free cash flow: $1,369.8 million for full year 2019, which represents a decrease of $52.1 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower underlying EBITDA and higher cash paid for taxes, partially offset by lower capital expenditures, favorable changes in working capital and lower cash paid for interest.     Debt: Total debt at the end of 2019 was $9.038 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $523.4 million, resulting in net debt of $8.514 billion.   

 Quarterly Consolidated Highlights (versus Fourth Quarter 2018 Results)       Net sales: $2.5 billion, increased by 2.8% and 3.0% in constant currency driven by net sales per hectoliter growth and higher financial volume, including an anticipated benefit in the U.S. from shipments exceeding brand volume as full year shipment volumes and brand volumes converged.     Net sales per hectoliter: $114.22 on a reported financial-volume basis, increased 1.8% and net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased by 1.1% in constant currency, driven by positive global pricing and mix, benefiting from our continued focus on premiumizing our portfolio.     Volume: Worldwide brand volume of 21.8 million hectoliters decreased 1.0%, primarily driven by lower economy volumes in the U.S. and weakened performance in Canada, partially offset by growth in International. Financial volume of 21.8 million hectoliters increased 1.0%, driven by quarterly timing of distributor inventories in the U.S., and growth in International, partially offset by lower volume in Canada and Europe. Global priority brand volume increased 1.6%.     Cost of goods sold (COGS) per hectoliter: on a reported basis, decreased 5.7% primarily driven by unrealized mark-to-market changes on our commodity positions, cost savings and foreign currency movements, partially offset by inflation.     Underlying COGS per hectoliter: increased 1.7% in constant currency primarily driven by inflation and mix, partially offset by cost savings. This increase was significantly improved versus prior quarters primarily reflecting fixed cost absorption in our U.S. business resulting from the timing of our financial volumes during the fourth quarter, and cycling one-time costs in our Canadian business.     U.S. GAAP net income attributable to MCBC: increased by $87.7 million driven by cycling the timing of shipments in the prior year, positive global net pricing, cost savings, a non-recurring vendor benefit in the U.S. and lower one-time incentive compensation expense driven by anticipated departures as a result of the revitalization plan which together account for approximately 50% of the reduction in marketing, general and administrative expense, along with timing of marketing investments, partially offset by restructuring charges and one-time pension and postretirement costs.     Underlying net income: increased 21.5%, driven by the same factors as U.S. GAAP net income with the exception of restructuring charges and one-time pension and postretirement costs.     Underlying EBITDA: increased 15.8% on a constant currency basis, largely driven by the same factors as underlying net income.

 Quarterly Segment Highlights (versus Fourth Quarter 2018 Results)     

 United States Business    Revenue: Net sales increased 4.7% due to higher financial volume and net sales per hectoliter (brand volume basis) growth of 1.6% driven by higher net pricing.   Volume: U.S. brand volume decreased 1.7%, driven by declines in the economy segment while our premium light and above premium portfolio trends improved. Sales-to-wholesalers (STWs) volume, excluding contract brewing, increased 2.5% driven by cycling lower shipments in the prior year attributed to quarterly timing of distributor inventories, partially offset by lower brand volume. On a full year basis, brand volume and STWs largely converged.   COGS per hectoliter increased 1.3%, due to inflation, partially offset by cost savings and fixed cost absorption related to increased financial volumes.   Marketing, general and administrative (MG&A) expense decreased 6.8% primarily driven by the shift of marketing investments to earlier in the year to support the launch of various above premium and innovation initiatives, as well as a non-recurring vendor benefit.   U.S. pretax income increased 18.3% from the prior year driven by higher financial volumes, lower MG&A expenses and higher net pricing, partially offset by inflation and special charges related to the planned closure of our Irwindale, California brewery and restructuring activities.   U.S. underlying EBITDA increased 16.5% driven by the same factors as U.S. GAAP results with the exception of special charges.   

 Canada Business    Revenue: Net sales decreased 4.6%, and 4.8% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume declines and a net sales per hectoliter (brand volume basis) decline of 0.7% in constant currency, primarily driven by unfavorable mix, partially offset by positive net pricing.   Volume: Canada brand volume decreased 6.9% and financial volume decreased 4.0% in the fourth quarter. The decline in brand volume is driven primarily by weakened brand performance and industry declines, while financial volume was positively impacted by cycling lower customer inventory levels in the prior year.   COGS per hectoliter decreased 1.4% in constant currency primarily driven by cycling one-time charges related to inventory write-offs and cost savings, partially offset by volume deleverage.   MG&A expense increased 0.9% in constant currency primarily driven by Truss joint venture start-up costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation.   Canada pretax income of $4.6 million, decreased $4.5 million from the prior year, driven primarily by restructuring charges, the gross profit impacts of volume declines, Truss joint venture start-up costs, partially offset by cycling one-time inventory write offs in the prior year, unrealized mark-to-market changes on our HEXO warrants and lower incentive compensation.   Canada underlying EBITDA decreased 0.9% in constant currency, primarily due to the same factors as U.S. GAAP results with the exception of restructuring charges and unrealized mark-to-market changes on our HEXO warrants.   

 Europe Business    Revenue: Net sales increased 1.1% and 2.1% in constant currency driven by net sales per hectoliter (brand volume basis) growth of 4.0% in constant currency as a result of positive pricing and mix.   Volume: Europe brand volume decreased 0.4% and financial volume decreased 1.4%. The decline in brand volumes is driven primarily by lower brand performance while our premium portfolio had strong momentum during the fourth quarter with higher volume growth than the full year.   COGS per hectoliter increased 4.7% in constant currency, primarily due to inflation.   MG&A expense decreased 10.7% in constant currency, primarily driven by the shift of marketing investments to earlier in the year and lower incentive compensation expense.   Europe pretax income increased 62.1% from the prior year, driven primarily by positive pricing and mix, special benefits related to consideration received following the termination of distribution, brewing and joint venture agreements with a partner in one of our markets, which substantially offset related impairment losses previously recorded during the third quarter, and lower MG&A expense, partially offset by inflation, restructuring charges, lower volume and unfavorable foreign currency movements.   Europe underlying EBITDA increased 18.0% in constant currency driven by the same factors as U.S. GAAP results with the exception of special benefits.   

 International Business    Revenue: Net sales increased 7.5% both on a reported basis and in constant currency, driven by brand volume growth, partially offset by a 5.3% decline in net sales per hectoliter (brand volume basis) in constant currency, due to geographic mix.   Volume: International brand volume increased 13.9% driven by strong Coors Light performance in Mexico, continued growth in Argentina and timing of STWs, partially offset by India supply chain and demand constraints.   COGS per hectoliter increased 6.2% in constant currency, driven by inflation and geographic mix.   MG&A expense decreased 0.5% in constant currency.   International reported a pretax loss of $2.2 million, compared to a loss of $6.7 million in the prior year, driven by higher volume, lower MG&A expense and cycling higher special charges related to the exit of our China business, partially offset by negative geographic mix and restructuring charges.   International underlying EBITDA of $4.1 million increased 50.0% in constant currency driven by the same factors as U.S. GAAP results with the exception of special charges.   

 Corporate    Corporate reported a pretax loss of $133.2 million in the fourth quarter compared to a loss of $205.9 million in the prior year, primarily due to unrealized mark-to-market changes on our commodity positions, lower net interest expense and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by one-time pension and postretirement charges.   Corporate underlying EBITDA improved by $0.5 million, driven primarily by lower incentive compensation and project spend.

 Other Results     

 Cost Savings Update    We delivered full year cost savings of approximately $230 million in 2019, resulting in a total of approximately $725 million delivered over the course of our 2017 - 2019 program. The total savings over this 3 year program of $725 million exceeded the most recent guidance of $700 million and original goal of $550 million.   Total one-time costs to achieve transaction-related synergies were approximately $31 million in 2019. Total one-time costs to achieve our 2017 - 2019 transaction-related synergies were $208 million, of which approximately 70% was non-core operating expense and 30% was capital spending. Total costs over the 3 year program were approximately $20 million less than our most recent guidance of $230 million and approximately $140 million less than our original expectation of $350 million.   We are committed to continuing to deliver cost savings across the organization and are constantly evaluating the business to identify areas for additional savings. Our next generation cost savings program, which began in 2020, is currently expected to deliver approximately $600 million over the 3 year program term through 2022 and is focused around many of the same functions of the business as the 2017 - 2019 program. These cost savings include $150 million related to the revitalization plan.   Total one-time costs to achieve savings from the revitalization plan are expected to be approximately $120 million to $180 million. We began recognizing these costs in the fourth quarter of 2019, and expect the remainder will be spread through the balance of fiscal years 2020 and 2021.   

   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   Our fourth quarter effective tax rate increased to 19.6% from negative 9.2% a year ago, primarily due to a one-time tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in our effective tax rate during the full year 2019 was primarily driven by the $668.3 million impairment loss attributable to nondeductible goodwill of our Canada reporting unit as well as other one-time tax expense items recognized in 2019.     Our fourth quarter underlying effective tax rate increased to 22.5% from 13.7% a year ago, primarily due to the above mentioned one-time tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in our full year underlying tax rate versus the prior year was primarily due to the above mentioned one-time tax expenses recognized in 2019.   

 Special and Other Non-Core Items  

 The following special and other non-core items have been excluded from underlying results. See the Appendix for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.    During the fourth quarter of 2019, MCBC recognized a net special charge of $42.4 million, largely driven by restructuring charges related to our revitalization plan and asset abandonment charges consisting primarily of accelerated depreciation related to brewery closures, including the recently announced planned closure of our Irwindale, California brewery.     Additionally during the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded other non-core net costs of $39.9 million, primarily driven by one-time pension and postretirement charges, integration-related expenses and net changes in our unrealized mark-to-market positions on commodity hedges and our HEXO warrants.   

 2020 Outlook     

 We currently expect the following for full year 2020, which we consider a transition year:    Net Sales Revenue: flat to low-single digit decrease on a constant currency basis.     Underlying EBITDA: high-single digit decrease from the full year 2019 underlying EBITDA of $2.364 billion, on a constant currency basis.     Underlying free cash flow: $1.1 billion, plus or minus 10%.     Capital spending: approximately $700 million, plus or minus 10%.     Cost savings: approximately $600 million for the 2020 to 2022 program which includes the cost savings associated with the revitalization program.     Underlying depreciation and amortization: approximately $850 million.     Consolidated net interest expense: approximately $280 million, plus or minus 5%.     Underlying effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 24% for 2020 and beyond, which remains subject to additional definitive guidance and finalized regulations from the U.S. government regarding the implementation of the tax reform legislation from 2017.     Deleverage & Dividend: We intend to maintain our investment grade rating as demonstrated by our continued deleverage. Additionally, our intention is to maintain a dividend payout-ratio target in the range of 20%-25% of trailing annual underlying EBITDA.

 Overview of Molson Coors     

 For over two centuries Molson Coors has been brewing beverages that unite people for all of life’s moments. From Coors Light, Miller Lite, Molson Canadian, Carling, and Staropramen to Coors Banquet, Blue Moon Belgian White, Saint Archer Gold, Leinenkugel’s Summer Shandy, Creemore Springs and more, Molson Coors produces some of the most beloved and iconic beer brands ever made. While the company’s history is rooted in beer, Molson Coors offers a modern portfolio that expands beyond the beer aisle with sparkling cocktails, hard coffee, canned wine, kombucha, cider and more.  

 At December 31, 2019 Molson Coors operated through Molson Coors Canada, MillerCoors in the U.S., Molson Coors Europe and Molson Coors International. The company’s commitment to raising industry standards and leaving a positive imprint on our employees, consumers, communities and the environment is reflected in Our Beer Print and our 2025 sustainability targets.  

 Effective January 2020, we moved from a corporate center and four business units to two business units - North America and Europe. The change in structure to two business units and the resulting financial reporting segment changes will not be reflected until our first quarter 2020 results. We also changed our name from Molson Coors Brewing Company to Molson Coors Beverage Company, in January 2020, in order to better reflect our strategic intent to expand beyond beer and into other growth adjacencies in the beverage industry.

 Forward-Looking Statements     

 This press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. Generally, the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “project,” “will,” “outlook,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historic in nature. Statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth, cost savings and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements, and include, but are not limited to, statements under the heading "2020 Outlook," expectations regarding future dividends, overall volume trends, consumer preferences, pricing trends, industry forces, cost reduction strategies, including our revitalization plan announced in 2019 and the estimated range of related charges and timing of cash charges, anticipated results, expectations for funding future capital expenditures and operations, debt service capabilities, timing and amounts of debt and leverage levels, shipment levels and profitability, market share and the sufficiency of capital resources. Although the Company believes that the assumptions upon which its forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these assumptions will prove to be correct. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s historical experience, and present projections and expectations are disclosed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These factors include, among others, the impact of increased competition resulting from further consolidation of brewers, competitive pricing and product pressures; health of the beer industry and our brands in our markets; economic conditions in our markets; additional impairment charges; our ability to maintain manufacturer/distribution agreements; changes in our supply chain system; availability or increase in the cost of packaging materials; success of our joint ventures; risks relating to operations in developing and emerging markets; changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of distribution systems; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; increase in the cost of commodities used in the business; the impact of climate change and the availability and quality of water; loss or closure of a major brewery or other key facility; our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, including executing and realizing cost savings; our ability to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses; our ability to achieve expected tax benefits, accretion and cost savings relating to our acquisition of MillerCoors; pension plan and other post-retirement benefit costs; failure to comply with debt covenants or deterioration in our credit rating; our ability to maintain good labor relations; our ability to maintain brand image, reputation and product quality; and other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. All forward-looking statements in this press release are expressly qualified by such cautionary statements and by reference to the underlying assumptions. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  

 APPENDIX     

 Worldwide Brand and Financial Volumes     

 Worldwide brand volume (or "brand volume" when discussed by segment) reflects only owned brands sold to unrelated external customers within our geographic markets (net of returns and allowances), royalty volume and our proportionate share of equity investment worldwide brand volume calculated consistently with MCBC owned volume. Contract brewing and wholesaler volume is included within financial volume, but is removed from worldwide brand volume, as this is non-owned volume for which we do not directly control performance. Our worldwide brand volume definition also includes an adjustment from Sales-to-Wholesaler (STW) volume to Sales-to-Retailer (STR) volume. We believe the brand volume metric is important because, unlike financial volume and STWs, it provides the closest indication of the performance of our brands in relation to market and competitor sales trends.  

 Use of Non-GAAP Measures     

 In addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP"), we also present constant currency, "underlying COGS" and "underlying COGS per hectoliter" (underlying COGS divided by reported financial volume), "underlying pretax and net income," "underlying income per diluted share," "underlying effective tax rate," and "underlying free cash flow," which are non-GAAP measures and should be viewed as supplements to (not substitutes for) our results of operations presented under U.S. GAAP. We also present underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("underlying EBITDA") as a non-GAAP measure. Our management uses underlying income, underlying income per diluted share, underlying EBITDA, and underlying effective tax rate as measures of operating performance, as well as underlying free cash flow in the measure of cash generated from core operations, to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance; as useful comparisons to the performance of our competitors; and as metrics of certain management incentive compensation calculations. We believe that underlying income, underlying income per diluted share, underlying EBITDA, and underlying effective tax rate performance are used by, and are useful to, investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance, as well as underlying free cash flow in evaluating our generation of cash from core operations, because they provide an additional tool to evaluate our performance without regard to special and non-core items, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and capital structure. In addition to the reasons discussed above, we consider underlying free cash flow an important measure of our ability to generate cash, grow our business and enhance shareholder value, driven by core operations and after adjusting for non-core items. In addition, constant-currency results exclude the impact of foreign currency movements. For discussion and analysis of our liquidity, see the consolidated statements of cash flows and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our latest Form 10-K and 10-Q filings with the SEC.  

 We have provided reconciliations of all historical non-GAAP measures to their nearest U.S. GAAP measure and have consistently applied the adjustments within our reconciliations in arriving at each non-GAAP measure. These adjustments consist of special items from our U.S. GAAP financial statements as well as other non-core items, such as integration related costs, unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses, and gains and losses on sales of non-operating assets, included in our U.S. GAAP results that warrant adjustment to arrive at non-GAAP results. We consider these items to be necessary adjustments for purposes of evaluating our ongoing business performance and are often considered non-recurring. Such adjustments are subjective and involve significant management judgment.  

 Our guidance for underlying depreciation and amortization, underlying free cash flow and underlying effective tax rate are also non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or otherwise have been adjusted for special items from our U.S. GAAP financial statements as well as other non-core items, such as integration related costs, unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses, and gains and losses on sales of non-operating assets, included in our U.S. GAAP results that warrant adjustment to arrive at non-GAAP results. We consider these items to be necessary adjustments for purposes of evaluating our ongoing business performance and are often considered non-recurring. Such adjustments are subjective and involve significant management judgment. We are unable to reconcile the above described guidance measures to their nearest U.S. GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of the special and other non-core items. By their very nature, special and other non-core items are difficult to anticipate with precision because they are generally associated with unexpected and unplanned events that impact our company and its financial results. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.  

 Constant currency is a non-GAAP measure utilized by Molson Coors management to measure performance, excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, and is intended to be indicative of results in local currency. As we operate in various foreign countries where the local currency may strengthen or weaken significantly versus the U.S. dollar or other currencies used in operations, we utilize a constant currency measure as an additional metric to evaluate the underlying performance of each business without consideration of foreign currency movements. This information is non-GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to (not a substitute for) our reported results of operations under U.S. GAAP. We calculate the impact of foreign exchange on net sales, pretax income, non-GAAP underlying EBITDA and non-GAAP underlying pretax income using the following steps:    Multiply our current period local currency operating results (that also include the impact of the comparable prior-period currency hedging activities) by the weighted average foreign exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior year period. The result is the current-period operating results in U.S. dollars, as if foreign exchange rates had not changed from the prior-year period.   Subtract the result in step 1 from the unadjusted current-period reported operating result in U.S. dollars (U.S. GAAP measure). This difference reflects the impact of foreign currency translational gains/losses included in the current-period results.   Determine the amount of actual non-operating foreign currency gains/losses as a result of hedging activities and activities transacted in a currency other than the functional currency of each legal entity.   Add the results of steps 2 and 3 above. This sum equals the total impact of foreign currency translational gains/losses and realized gains/losses from foreign currency transactions. This is the value shown in the “Foreign Exchange $ Impact” column within the tables above.
