For the fourth quarter of 2019, WEC Energy Group recorded net income of $243.9 million, or 77 cents per share. This compares to earnings of $205.0 million, or 65 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 2018.

"From network reliability to customer satisfaction to earnings and dividend growth, the company continues to perform at a high level," said Gale Klappa, executive chairman. "And we're poised for progress in 2020 as we work to deliver a clean energy future that is safe, reliable and affordable."

During the fourth quarter of 2019, two WEC Energy Group utilities - We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service - were honored for superior reliability of their electric delivery networks.
