2020 capital investment 20% lower than 2019

Reaffirms capability and commitment to achieving free cash flow neutrality by end of 2020 through operational efficiencies, cost reductions, well outperformance and hedge program benefits

SPRING, Texas – February 27, 2020...Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 and issued 2020 guidance. 

“Once again, our team achieved results at or above the midpoint of guidance across all metrics highlighting our established culture of outperformance while operating safely and responsibly.

“Foundational to the Company’s resilience, especially in the current pricing environment, are a strong balance sheet, capital discipline, unique Tier 1 condensate and liquids rich acreage and a multi-year hedge position. We remain confident in our ability to return the Company to free cash flow by the end of this year and be firmly positioned to deliver an attractive long-term value proposition for shareholders,” Way continued.

2019 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results

The table below summarizes select financial statistics. Results for 2019 may not be comparable to 2018 due to the December 2018 Fayetteville Shale divestiture.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes $86 million and $375 million of Adjusted EBITDA from the divested Fayetteville Shale assets for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively. 

(2)Capital investments on the cash flow statement include decreases of $18 million and $74 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and an increase of $34 million and a decrease of $53 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, relating to the change in accrued expenditures between periods.

Fourth Quarter 2019 Financial Results

Southwestern Energy recorded net income attributable to common stock of $110 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted net income, which excludes the impact of unsettled derivatives and one-time items, was $99 million or $0.18 per diluted share in 2019 and $176 million or $0.31 per share for the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of the Fayetteville Shale divestiture, the decrease was primarily related to a decrease in commodity prices, partially offset by a $167 million increase in settled derivatives compared to 2018. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $266 million, net cash provided by operating activities was $225 million and net cash flow (non-GAAP) was $246 million.

Fourth quarter 2019 weighted average realized price (including transportation costs) was $2.12 per Mcfe excluding derivatives compared to $3.15 per Mcfe in 2018. Including derivatives and excluding transportation costs, the weighted average realized price in the fourth quarter of $2.85 per Mcfe was 8% less than prior year despite a 31% decrease in NYMEX Henry Hub.

Adjusted net income for 2019 was $328 million, or $0.61 per share, compared to $590 million, or $1.02 per share, in 2018. The decrease in adjusted net income compared to prior year was primarily the result of a decrease in commodity prices and the divestiture of the Fayetteville Shale, partially offset by a $274 million increase in settled derivatives impact, a 23% increase in liquids production and decreased interest and G&A expense. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $973 million, net cash provided by operating activities was $964 million and net cash flow (non-GAAP) was $913 million.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). However, management believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results, the results of its peers and of prior periods. 

One such non-GAAP financial measure is net cash flow. Management presents this measure because (i) it is accepted as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company’s ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt, (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the Company may not control and (iii) changes in operating assets and liabilities may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred.

Additional non-GAAP financial measures the Company may present from time to time are net debt, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA, all which exclude certain charges or amounts. Management presents these measures because (i) they are consistent with the manner in which the Company’s position and performance are measured relative to the position and performance of its peers, (ii) these measures are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts, and (iii) charges or amounts excluded cannot be reasonably estimated and guidance provided by the Company excludes information regarding these types of items. These adjusted amounts are not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.
