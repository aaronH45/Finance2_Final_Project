Item 2.05 Costs Associated With Exit or Disposal Activities.

On February 13, 2020, General Motors Company (the “Company”) approved a plan to wind-down its sales, design, and engineering operations in Australia and New Zealand and cease sales of Holden vehicles no later than 2021. The Company will make provisions to continue providing servicing and spare parts to customers for an extended period of time, as well as certain other customer-related services. On this date, the Company approved the execution of a binding term sheet with Great Wall Motors to sell its vehicle manufacturing facility in Thailand and similarly approved a plan to wind-down the balance of its operations there by the end of 2020. These actions were taken to strengthen the Company’s core business and focus investment on other opportunities that will derive the greatest returns for shareholders and support investment in future technologies.

As a result of these actions, the Company expects to incur net cash charges of approximately $0.3 billion, which reflects the impact of the expected proceeds of $0.1 billion from the sale of the Company’s manufacturing facility in Thailand. The Company expects to record total cash and non-cash charges in connection with these actions of up to $1.1 billion, primarily in the first quarter and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2020. These special charges consist of up to $0.6 billion for non-cash charges associated with asset impairments covering deferred tax assets, intangibles, and inventory and the recognition of accumulated foreign currency losses; up to $0.5 billion of cash charges for contract termination and other similar exit costs, including dealer restructuring costs, supplier and lease termination costs, sponsorship costs, and costs related to the resolution of existing and anticipated future legal claims; and insignificant one-time employee-related costs. These charges will be considered special for EBIT-adjusted, EPS-diluted-adjusted, and Adjusted automotive free cash flow reporting purposes.
