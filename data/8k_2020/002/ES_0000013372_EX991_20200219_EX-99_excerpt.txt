2020 and Long-Term Earnings Per Share (EPS) Guidance 

Also today, Eversource Energy projected 2020 earnings of between $3.60 per share and $3.70 per share, as well as long-term EPS growth through 2024 from its core regulated utility segments of between 5 percent and 7 percent, using 2019 non-GAAP earnings of $3.45 per share as the base. 

Electric Distribution and Generation 

Eversource Energy’s electric distribution segment earned $513.3 million for the full year 2019, compared with earnings of $455.4 million for the full year 2018. The segment earned $90.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with earnings of $76.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Higher fourth quarter and full-year results were due primarily to higher distribution revenues, partially offset by higher depreciation and operations and maintenance (O&M) expense. 

Electric Transmission 

Eversource Energy’s transmission segment earned $460.9 million1 for the full year of 2019, excluding the NPT charge, compared with earnings of $427.2 million for the full year 2018. The transmission segment earned $118.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with earnings of $97.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Higher earnings in 2019 were due primarily to an increased level of investment in Eversource Energy transmission facilities. 

Natural Gas Distribution 

Eversource Energy’s natural gas distribution segment earned $96.2 million for the full year 2019, compared with earnings of $93.2 million for the full year 2018. Fourth quarter natural gas segment earnings were $38.6 million in 2019, compared with earnings of $43 million in 2018. Improved results for the full year 2019 were due primarily to higher revenues from the Yankee Gas rate settlement. Lower results in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with the same period of 2018, were driven primarily by higher O&M and depreciation expense. 

Water Distribution 

Eversource Energy’s water distribution segment earned $34.9 million for the full year 2019 and $8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with earnings of $30.9 million for the full year 2018 and $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. 

Eversource Energy Parent and Other Companies 

Eversource Energy parent and other companies earned $8.2 million for the full year 2019, compared with earnings of $26.3 million for the full year of 2018. It lost $5.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with earnings of $10.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Lower fourth-quarter results were due to a higher effective tax rate in 2019. Full-year results were also affected by higher interest expense.

1All per-share amounts in this news release are reported on a diluted basis. The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Eversource Energy. The earnings and EPS of each business do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such business, but rather represent a direct interest in Eversource Energy's assets and liabilities as a whole. EPS by business is a non-GAAP (not determined using generally accepted accounting principles) measure that is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to common shareholders of each business by the weighted average diluted Eversource Energy common shares outstanding for the period. Earnings discussions also include non-GAAP financial measures referencing 2019 earnings and EPS excluding the NPT impairment charge. 

Eversource Energy uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results by business and to more fully compare and explain 2019 results without including the impact of the NPT impairment charge. Management believes the NPT impairment charge is not indicative of Eversource Energy’s ongoing performance. Due to the nature and significance of the NPT impairment charge on net income attributable to common shareholders, management believes that the non-GAAP presentation is a more meaningful representation of Eversource Energy’s financial performance and provides additional and useful information to readers in analyzing historical and future performance of the business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to Eversource Energy’s consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of Eversource Energy’s operating performance.
