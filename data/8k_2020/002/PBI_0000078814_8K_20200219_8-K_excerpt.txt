ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

On February 19, 2020 Pitney Bowes Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a First Incremental Facility Amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2019 (the “Existing Credit Agreement”), by and among the Company, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The Amendment includes an $850,000,000 tranche B term loan facility (the “Term Loan B Facility”). The Amendment provides that the Term Loan B Facility has a final maturity date of January 7, 2025. The loans under the Term Loan B Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to either a base rate plus a margin equal to 4.50%, or a Eurocurrency rate plus a margin equal to 5.50%, as selected by the Company. Voluntary prepayments of outstanding loans under the Term Loan B Facility in connection with any repricing transaction during the twelve-month period beginning on December 18, 2019 are subject to payment of a prepayment premium equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the loans prepaid. The Term Loan B Facility is secured by the same assets that secure the term loan A and revolving facilities under the Existing Credit Agreement and is subject to the same representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are applicable to the term loan A and revolving facilities under the Existing Credit Agreement. 

The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.

As previously reported in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 10, 2020, the proceeds of the Term Loan B Facility will be used to (i) along with available cash, finance the settlement of the Company’s previously announced Tender Offers for certain existing senior notes and (ii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing.
