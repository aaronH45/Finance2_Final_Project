Departure of Director

to not stand for 

re-election to the Board of Directors of Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (the “Company”) at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company and her term will therefore end at the conclusion of the 2020 Annual Meeting. Ms. Korologos’ retirement comes after 27 years of distinguished service to the Company. She joined the Company’s Board in 1993. Ms. Korologos confirmed to the Board that her determination to not stand for 

re-election is not the result of any disagreement with the Company relating to its operations, policies or practices. The Board also determined that, effective at the conclusion of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the size of the Board shall be decreased from eleven to ten directors.
