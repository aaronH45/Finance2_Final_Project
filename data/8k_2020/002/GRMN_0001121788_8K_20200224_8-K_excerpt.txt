Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement 

On February 24, 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Garmin Ltd. (the “Company”) approved forms of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreements (the “Form Award Agreements”) to be used for awards of restricted stock units under the Garmin Ltd. 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated on June 7, 2019, that have performance-based as well as time-based vesting requirements. 

Under the terms of the Form Award Agreements, the restricted stock unit awards are contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue and profitability goals for the Company’s fiscal year in the year of grant established by the Compensation Committee as well as on time-based vesting requirements. At a meeting of the Compensation Committee in the subsequent year (the “Certification Date”), the Compensation Committee will determine whether each of the performance goals for these awards was achieved during the year of grant, and the percentage of the restricted stock units that corresponds with the weighting attributed to each performance goal that was achieved will be payable to the grantee (subject to the time-based conditions) as follows: one-third will be payable within 30 days after the Certification Date if the grantee is then still employed by the Garmin entity that employs the grantee; one-third will be payable on the first anniversary of the Certification Date if the grantee is then still employed by the Garmin entity that employs the grantee; and the remaining one-third will then be payable on the second anniversary of the Certification Date if the grantee is then still employed by the Garmin entity that employs the grantee. The Form Award Agreements provide that the percentage of the restricted stock units that may vest upon achievement of the performance goals may exceed one hundred percent (100%). 

The Compensation Committee approved five separate Form Award Agreements. The first is for award grantees who reside in Switzerland and who are executive officers of the Company. The second is for award grantees who reside in countries other than Switzerland and who are executive officers of the Company. The third is for award grantees who reside in Switzerland and who are not executive officers of the Company. The fourth is for award grantees who reside in Canada and who are not executive officers of the Company. The fifth is for award grantees who reside in countries other than Switzerland and Canada and who are not executive officers of the Company. These Form Award Agreements are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5, respectively, and are incorporated herein by this reference. 

The description in this Form 8-K of the Form Award Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copies of the Form Award Agreements that are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5.
