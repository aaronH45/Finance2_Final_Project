On February 4, 2020, Conagra Brands, Inc. (the “Company”) elected to exercise its optional redemption rights to redeem $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Floating Rate Notes due 2020 (the “Notes”), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee under the indenture governing the Notes, issued a notice of partial redemption to registered holders of the Notes. The date fixed for the redemption of the Notes is February 21, 2020 (the “Redemption Date”).
