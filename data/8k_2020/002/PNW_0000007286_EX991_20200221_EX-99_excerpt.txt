Pinnacle West Reports 2019 Full-Year and Fourth-Quarter Results

•Earnings reflect customer growth, infrastructure investments, cost management 

•PNW makes ‘A list’ for action on climate change and water security as company sets course for 100 percent clean energy

•Service reliability for power customers reaches a company best

PHOENIX -- Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $538.3 million, or $4.77 per diluted share, for full-year 2019. This result compares with net income of $511.0 million, or $4.54 per share, in 2018.

“In 2019, our principal subsidiary Arizona Public Service saw its customer base grow two percent, and this growth is something we expect to continue as people move to Arizona and businesses choose our service territory to locate and expand,” said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and CEO Jeff Guldner. “These earnings are consistent with serving more customers and making substantial investments in expanding and strengthening our infrastructure to meet their evolving energy needs.”

Investments deliver customer, environmental benefits

Infrastructure investments coupled with operational excellence by employees culminated in APS’ best-ever reliability performance as measured by the System Average Interruption Frequency Index. This index is an industry standard that measures how many customers experienced a power interruption out of total number of customers served. Excluding voluntary outages and proactive fire mitigation efforts, APS finished 2019 with its best score on record, and on the basis reported to Edison Electric Institute, reliability is expected to remain top-quartile performance among all reporting utilities. 

In January, CDP, a non-profit global environmental disclosure platform, qualified Pinnacle West for its prestigious ‘A List’ for corporate transparency and action on climate change and water security, based on the company’s disclosure in 2019. Using a comprehensive, independent and transparent methodology, CDP scores thousands of companies from A to D- on an annual basis. According to CDP, Pinnacle West became one of only 10 American 

companies in 2019 to make the A List for both climate change and water, and through its APS operations, the only electric utility to earn this recognition.

“This achievement is the result of ongoing collaboration with key stakeholders like regulators and communities for the ultimate benefit of our customers and shareholders, who count on us for environmentally and socially responsible operations,” Guldner said. “This A-list rating came just as we announced our new goal to serve APS customers with 100 percent clean energy by 2050. This is an exciting time for our employees, customers and all stakeholders as we guide our business and investments toward a carbon-free energy future.”

Employees deliver savings through focus on the customer

For the quarter ended December 31, 2019, Pinnacle West reported higher consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $64.0 million, or $0.57 per diluted share. This result compares with net income of $26.1 million, or $0.23 per share, for the same period a year ago. Meeting the original guidance range was made possible in part to fourth-quarter operations and maintenance savings. 

“Employees are demonstrating their commitment to long-term customer affordability through innovation and sustainable cost management,” Guldner said. “The end goal is to keep APS rate increases for customers at or below the rate of inflation over time. This focus on how our decisions and practices affect customers is a fundamental part of my vision for a customer-centric culture, and is essential to creating shareholder value.” 

Financial Outlook 

The company reaffirms its 2020 estimated consolidated earnings will be within a range of $4.75 to $4.95 per diluted share, and expects to achieve a weather-normalized, consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5 percent. Key factors and assumptions underlying the 2020 outlook can be found in the year-end/fourth-quarter 2019 earnings presentation slides at pinnaclewest.com/investors.
