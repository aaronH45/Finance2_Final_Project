Revenues for the quarter were $799.9 million, a decrease of 6.2% from $852.7 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding divestitures, foreign exchange and changes in sorted office paper (“SOP”) pricing, revenues increased 1.3%. Loss from operations in the quarter was $198.5 million, compared to loss from operations of $345.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This includes non-cash impairment and divestiture charges of $251.8 million in 2019 and $392.0 million in 2018. Net loss was $219.3 million, or $2.41 diluted loss per share, compared with net loss of $318.4 million, or $3.51 diluted loss per share, in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $152.8 million, or 19.1% of revenues, compared with $180.5 million, or 21.2% of revenues in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.72 compared to $1.03 in the 2018 comparable period. 

KEY BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS: 

•  

Stericycle continued to deliver progress on its portfolio rationalization and debt reduction efforts with the announcement on February 7, 2020 of an agreement to divest substantially all of its Domestic Environmental Solutions business and the divestiture of non-core operations in Chile during December 2019. 

•  

The Company also drove results from its quality of revenue initiatives as organic revenue growth was up 2.0% in Regulated Waste and Compliance Services (“RWCS”), the highest growth rate in three years. 

•  

Free Cash Flow for the quarter was $13.8 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $53.8 million.  

“I am pleased with the progress we’ve shown since our new leadership team was put into place. Our actions enabled us to hit the highest growth rate in our core regulated medical waste business in over three years and to generate free cash flow in the second half of the year,” said Cindy J. Miller, Chief Executive Officer. “Our fourth quarter results demonstrate that we continue to move in the right direction to drive growth, improve profitability and deliver long-term shareholder value.”  

FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS  

U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) Results 

•  

Revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, were $799.9 million, compared to $852.7 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The decline was due to divestitures, which reduced revenues by $36.2 million, and macroeconomic factors of SOP pricing and foreign exchange rates, which reduced revenues by $19.3 million and $9.0 million, respectively. Organic revenue growth for RWCS and Secure Information Destruction (“SID”) excluding SOP pricing was 2.0% and 1.8%, respectively. Organic revenue growth was partially offset by declines in Manufacturing and Industrial (“M&I”) and Communication and Related Services (“CRS”). 

•  

Loss from operations in the quarter was $198.5 million, compared to loss from operations of $345.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding the year-over-year impact of non-cash impairment and divestiture charges, income from operations was $53.3 million, an increase of $7.2 million from 2018. This improvement was the result of lower SG&A, primarily related to reduced consulting and professional fees for litigation, compliance and material weakness remediation of $36.1 million. The improvement was partially offset by the SOP pricing impact of $19.3 million and higher costs related to hazardous waste operations of $9.8 million. 

•  

Net loss was $219.3 million, or $2.41 diluted loss per share, compared with $318.4 million, or $3.51 diluted loss per share, in the fourth quarter of last year. This reflects the previously highlighted significant charges and operational items, as well as a lower effective tax rate on a loss from operations compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. 

•  

Cash flow from operations for the full year was $248.0 million, compared to $165.7 million for 2018. In 2018, cash flow from operations was reduced by the Small Quantity customer class action settlement payment of $295.0 million. Excluding the settlement payment, cash flow from operations decreased $212.7 million, primarily due to lower operating performance in 2019, as previously highlighted, and payments in 2019 for certain litigation matters, 2018 incentive compensation and ERP-related prepaid software. 

•  

Cash paid for capital expenditures for the year was $194.2 million as compared to $130.8 million in 2018, primarily driven by investment in our ERP implementation. 

Non-GAAP Results 

•  

Adjusted EBITDA was $152.8 million, compared to $180.5 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease was driven by SOP pricing of $19.3 million and higher costs related to hazardous waste operations of $9.8 million. 

•  

Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.72, compared to $1.03 in the fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to SOP pricing, higher operating costs, and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by lower interest expense. 

•  

Free Cash Flow for the quarter was $13.8 million, bringing the year to date total to $53.8 million. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

Non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures in the schedules attached hereto.

RECENT EVENTS 

On February 7, 2020, Stericycle announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Domestic Environmental Solutions business to Harsco Corporation (NYSE: HSC) for $462.5 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the agreement (the “Transaction”). The Transaction includes Stericycle’s M&I Services and the retail portion of Hazardous Waste Services reported under RWCS, which together employ approximately 2,000 team members across 61 facilities. Stericycle will continue to offer solutions for unused consumer pharmaceutical take-back services and provide hazardous waste services to healthcare customers. Harsco will provide transportation and disposal services to Stericycle under a long-term service agreement to be entered into at the closing of the Transaction. The Transaction is subject to customary post-closing covenants and indemnity obligations. For more information, please see Stericycle’s Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed February 7, 2020. 

In December, Stericycle completed the sale of its operations in Chile to an affiliate of Veolia for approximately $30.7 million. The transaction is subject to customary post-closing covenants and indemnity obligations. 

Today Stericycle filed a Form 8-K announcing an amendment to its now secured credit facility. Under the terms of the amendment, Stericycle’s maximum Debt-to-Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (“Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA”) leverage ratio has been increased to 5.0 with a step down to 4.5 in the first quarter of 2022. The completion of the Domestic Environmental Solutions divestiture would trigger a step-down in the covenant leverage ratio to 4.75 at close and 4.25 in the first quarter of 2022. The $200 million of cash addbacks to Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA will continue through December 31, 2020, then reduce to $100 million through December 31, 2021, with no further addbacks thereafter. The Company proactively pursued this additional financing flexibility to remove any potential distraction during its year of transformation. As of December 31 2019, Stericycle was in compliance with its leverage ratio covenant.  

FINANCIAL GUIDANCE 

Stericycle today provided financial guidance for the full-year 2020, as summarized in the table below. The Company’s guidance is based on currently known items and certain business assumptions including current foreign exchange rates and estimates for SOP pricing. The Domestic Environmental Solutions business remains in the annual guidance.

For guidance purposes, it is not possible to predict or provide without unreasonable effort a reconciliation reflecting the impact of future acquisitions, divestitures, certain litigation, settlements and regulatory compliance matters, uncertain U.S. cash tax matters, certain other items or other unanticipated events, which would be included in reported (U.S. GAAP) results and could be material.  

(3)  

Free Cash Flow guidance includes estimates for: 

•  

ERP implementation operating expenditures of $40 million to $60 million and consulting and professional fees for internal control remediation activities and portfolio rationalization of $20 million to $30 million that will be reported as Adjusted Non-GAAP items; and  

•  

Capital expenditures of $175 million to $195 million, which includes cash paid for ERP implementation capital expenditures of $45 million to $55 million.

Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections of our management about future events and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include, among others, SOP pricing volatility, foreign exchange rate volatility in the jurisdictions in which we operate, the volume and size of any recall events, changes in governmental regulation of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information, the level of government enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste collection and treatment or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information, decreases in the volume of regulated wastes or personal and confidential information collected from customers, the ability to implement our ERP system, charges related to portfolio rationalization or the failure of divestitures to achieve the desired results, failure to consummate transactions with respect to non-core businesses, including the risk that the Domestic Environmental Solutions transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, the failure to satisfy the conditions to the consummation of such transaction, including the receipt of certain governmental and regulatory approvals, the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Domestic Environmental Solutions transaction on Stericycle’s business relationships, operating results and business generally and risks related to diverting management’s attention from Stericycle’s ongoing business operations, the obligations to service substantial indebtedness and comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and notes, a downgrade in our credit rating resulting in an increase in interest expense, political, economic, inflationary and other risks related to our foreign operations, the outcome of pending or future litigation or investigations including with respect to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, changing market conditions in the healthcare industry, competition and demand for services in the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries, failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, delays or failures in implementing remediation efforts with respect to existing or future material weaknesses, disruptions in or attacks on information technology systems, as well as other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q.

The comparisons at constant currency rates (foreign exchange) reflect comparative local currency balances at prior period’s foreign exchange rates. Stericycle calculated these percentages by taking current period reported Revenues less the respective prior period reported Revenues, divided by the prior period reported Revenues, all at the respective prior period’s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in Revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates

have not changed between the prior and the current period. Management believes the use of this measure aids in the understanding of changes in Revenues without the impact of foreign currency.

Additionally, the Company uses such Non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating business unit and management performance. All Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable U.S. GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation from, or a replacement for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to, or calculated in the same manner as Non-GAAP financial measures published by other companies.

2018 includes dividends on our Series A mandatory convertible preferred stock of $25.5 million. 

For the purpose of calculating the ultimate EPS impact, for 2018, of our mandatory convertible preferred stock we showed the impact by excluding the mandatory convertible preferred stock dividend and using the “if-converted” method of share dilution. This provides insight to how our diluted share count was affected by the potential conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred shares prior to their actual conversion in September 2018. 

As a result of the conversion in September 2018, the preferred stock had no impact on Adjusted Diluted EPS or the diluted shares outstanding for 2019. 

The impact of excluding the preferred stock dividend from Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.29 and the increase in diluted shares outstanding under the “if-converted” method was 3.5 million for 2018. The impact of all adjusting items under the “if-converted” method to our Adjusted Diluted EPS had a dilutive effect of $0.17 for 2018.

(a) The Non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release are reconciled to the most comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the schedules attached to this release. Management believes the Non-GAAP financial measures are useful measures of Stericycle’s performance because they provide additional information about Stericycle’s operations and exclude certain adjusting items, allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Additionally, the Company uses such Non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating business unit and management performance. All Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable U.S. GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation from, or a replacement for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to, or calculated in the same manner as Non-GAAP financial measures published by other companies. 

(b) (Loss) Income from Operations and Adjusted Income from Operations provide the basis for other financial measures. 

(c) Under the Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Common Shareholders column, adjustments are shown net of tax in aggregate of $105.9 million and $164.7 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively, based on applying the statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the adjustment occurred or, by adjusting the tax effect to consider the impact of applying an annual effective tax rate on an interim basis.
