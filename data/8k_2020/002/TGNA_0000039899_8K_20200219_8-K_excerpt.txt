Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.   

On February 19, 2020, in connection with the ongoing refreshment process of the Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors”) of TEGNA Inc. (“TEGNA”), TEGNA appointed Karen Grimes to the Board of Directors, effective immediately. The Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that Ms. Grimes is “independent” under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).  

Ms. Grimes, 63, spent more than 20 years at Wellington Management Company, a leading investment management firm, where she was a Partner, Senior Managing Director and Equity Portfolio Manager until her retirement in 2018. She currently serves on the Board of Directors of Toll Brothers, Inc., where she is a member of the Audit & Risk Committee.  

Ms. Grimes will receive compensation for her service on the Board of Directors in accordance with TEGNA’s standard compensatory arrangements for non-employee directors. A description of the compensatory arrangements for non-employee directors will be included in TEGNA’s proxy statement on Schedule 14A for its 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, which will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) prior to its 2020 annual meeting of stockholders.  

There are no arrangements or understandings between Ms. Grimes and any other person pursuant to which she was selected to serve as a director of TEGNA. Neither Ms. Grimes nor any of her related persons (as defined in Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act) is a party to any transaction in which TEGNA is a participant that is required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act.  

A copy of TEGNA’s press release announcing the appointment is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
