Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the sale of all of IPT's property-owning assets, other than the entities that hold IPT's limited partnership and general partnership interests in certain joint venture partnerships, to the Co-Investment Ventures was effected through (i) two mergers (each, a “Merger” and collectively the “Mergers”) of newly formed Delaware limited liability companies that were wholly owned subsidiaries of the Co-Investment Ventures (the “Merger Subs”) with and into newly formed, wholly owned subsidiaries of IPT Real Estate Holdco LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and indirect subsidiary of IPT (“IPT Holdco”) (and such wholly owned subsidiaries, the “New Holdcos”), with each applicable New Holdco surviving each Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of one of the Co-Investment Ventures upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, and (ii) the sale (each, an “Asset Transfer” and together with the Mergers, the “Asset Sale”) by IPT Holdco of nine limited liability companies that were wholly owned subsidiaries of IPT Holdco to the Co-Investment Ventures.
