CEO Perspective

Alan Armstrong, president and chief executive officer, made the following comments:

“Williams achieved yet another year of record results in 2019, once again delivering impressive year-over-year growth and exceeding guidance midpoints in our key financial metrics while dramatically reducing capital 

1

expenditures. These results were underpinned by our strong operations – we set records for both gathered volumes and firm reserved transportation capacity, and our safety metrics continue to improve. We also generated cash in excess of dividends and capital expenditures, reflecting the combined impact of strong business performance, capital discipline and our ongoing portfolio optimization efforts. These results are driving improvement in our credit metrics. Looking ahead to 2020, our disciplined approach to capital allocation should allow us to fully fund our increased dividend and capital expenditures with internally generated cash flows.

"Williams remains extremely well-positioned to capture long-term sustainable growth with our natural gas focused strategy. We continue to see demand for new transport capacity along our premier interstate transmission systems, and the scale and location of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets provide a strong competitive advantage to capture emerging growth opportunities. Our resilient G&P business can not only withstand current market pressures, but is also well-positioned to generate long-term value as demand for natural gas continues to grow.”

Armstrong added, “Natural gas has been – and will continue to be – a cornerstone of our nation’s prosperity in the 21st century and a critical part of our clean energy future. Abundant, low cost and reliable natural gas has driven significant reductions in U.S. CO2 emissions, lowered consumers’ utility bills and paved the way for investment in renewables. As the American energy leader that safely handles 30% of the nation’s natural gas, Williams’ large-scale infrastructure is ready to meet continued demand growth, both in the U.S. and abroad.”

GAAP Measures

•Fourth-quarter 2019 net income benefited from $69 million of increased service revenues driven by Transco expansion projects, the consolidation of UEOM revenues beginning in March 2019, and growth in Northeast G&P volumes. These improvements were partially offset by lower revenues from our Barnett Shale operations primarily associated with reduced recognition of non-cash deferred revenue and the end of a contractual minimum volume commitment (MVC) period. 

2

•Fourth-quarter 2019 also benefited from $1.7 billion lower net asset impairments, partially offset by $692 million due to the absence of 4Q '18 gains on asset sales and $141 million associated with the absence of 4Q '18 gains from the deconsolidation of certain businesses.

•Full-year 2019 net income benefited from $431 million of increased service revenues primarily due to the same drivers affecting 4Q '19, partially offset by the absence of revenues from operations sold or deconsolidated during 2018, as well as a $138 million decline in commodity margins. 

•The full year also benefited from $1.7 billion lower net asset impairments, partially offset by the absence of $692 million in gains on asset sales in 4Q '18 as well as $203 million associated with gains from the deconsolidation of certain businesses in 2018.

•Full-year 2019 net income also reflects lower income attributable to non-controlling interests due to the WPZ merger in 2018 and an increased provision for income taxes in 2019 driven by higher pre-tax income. 

•The increase in cash flow from operations for fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 periods were largely driven by the increased service revenues as previously described and the collection of Transco's filed rates, some of which is subject to refund. The YTD 2019 period also benefited from the receipt of an income tax refund.

Non-GAAP Measures

•The increase in adjusted EBITDA for 4Q 2019 and full-year 2019 largely reflects the previously mentioned increased Transco and Northeast G&P service revenues and the benefit of Transco's recently settled general rate case. Lower commodity margins partially offset the higher service revenues in full-year 2019.

•Adjusted income for both the quarter and full-year periods also improved, driven by the higher adjusted EBITDA. The full-year period variance also reflects less income attributable to noncontrolling interests driven by the WPZ merger, partially offset by higher interest expense associated with financing obligations for leased pipeline capacity and an increased provision for income taxes.

•Fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 DCF are higher, reflecting the increased adjusted EBITDA and lower maintenance capital, partially offset by higher net interest expense. The full-year increase also benefited from an income tax refund received in 2019.

Williams' operations are comprised of the following reportable segments: Atlantic-Gulf, West, Northeast G&P and Other.

Atlantic-Gulf

•Fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 modified and adjusted EBITDA reflect increased service revenues from Transco expansion projects placed in service and the benefit of Transco’s recently settled general rate case, partially offset by lower revenues from Gulfstar. Projects placed into full-service in 4Q '19 include the Gateway and Rivervale South to Market expansions serving the Northeast.

3

•Fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 modified EBITDA were negatively impacted by a $354 million impairment of the Constitution Pipeline project, of which Williams' 41% share was $145 million, as well as the absence of an $81 million prior-year gain on the sale of certain Gulf Coast pipeline assets. 

•Full-year 2019 modified EBITDA was also negatively impacted by lower equity AFUDC due to lower levels of construction activity and severance expenses.

•The impairment charges, gains on asset sales and severance expenses reflected in modified EBITDA are excluded from adjusted EBITDA.

•The company filed a formal stipulation and agreement for Transco’s rate case with the FERC on December 31. All comments received during the public comment period were in support of the settlement. The company anticipates FERC approval of the settlement in second-quarter 2020.

West

•Fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 modified and adjusted EBITDA reflect the absence of revenues from operations either sold or deconsolidated and lower revenues in Barnett Shale and Mid-Con, partially offset by higher revenue in Eagle Ford, Haynesville, the Conway fractionation and storage business and growth in JV EBITDA from Rocky Mountain Midstream. Fourth-quarter 2019 experienced an improvement in commodity margins driven by marketing activities, while full-year 2019 was unfavorably impacted by lower NGL prices.

•The lower revenue at Barnett Shale noted above was primarily associated with reduced recognition of non-cash deferred revenue and the end of a contractual MVC period. Lower revenues in Mid-Con noted above were due to lower rates and volumes.

•Fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 modified EBITDA were favorably impacted by the absence of the $1.8 billion impairment of certain Barnett Shale gathering assets in 2018, partially offset by the absence of a $591 million gain on the 2018 sale of our Four Corners operations.

•The impairment charges and gains on asset sales reflected in modified EBITDA are excluded from adjusted EBITDA.

•Fourth-quarter and YTD 2019 results reflect higher gathering volumes in the Eagle Ford, Haynesville, and Rocky Mountain Midstream systems. Eagle Ford gathering volumes increased by 9% versus 4Q '18 and by 10% YTD over 2018. Haynesville gathering volumes increased by 21% versus 4Q '18 and by 12% YTD over 2018. Rocky Mountain Midstream gathering volumes grew dramatically on a percentage basis, achieving an average of approximately 270 MMcf/d in 4Q 2019.

Northeast G&P

•Improvement in modified and adjusted EBITDA for 4Q and YTD 2019 was driven by increased service revenues from the Susquehanna Supply Hub, the Utica Shale region, and Ohio Valley, as well as the acquisition of Utica East Ohio Midstream in March 2019. The YTD improvements also reflect higher proportional EBITDA from our Appalachia Midstream investment driven by the Marcellus South system.

•The 4Q and YTD 2019 periods reflect increases in gross gathering volumes, including 100% of operated equity-method investments, of 12% and 15%, respectively, over the same reporting periods in 2018.

Non-GAAP Measures

This news release and accompanying materials may include certain financial measures – Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income (“earnings”), adjusted earnings per share, distributable cash flow and dividend coverage ratio – that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC.

Our segment performance measure, Modified EBITDA, is defined as net income (loss) before income (loss) from discontinued operations, income tax expense, net interest expense, equity earnings from equity-method investments, other net investing income, impairments of equity investments and goodwill, depreciation and amortization expense, and accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for nonregulated operations. We also add our proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments.

Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Management believes this measure provides investors meaningful insight into results from ongoing operations.

Distributable cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures, cash portion of net interest expense, income attributable to or dividends/ distributions paid to noncontrolling interests and cash income taxes, and certain other adjustments that management believes affects the comparability of results. Adjustments for maintenance capital expenditures and cash portion of interest expense include our proportionate share of these items of our equity-method investments. We also calculate the ratio of distributable cash flow to the total cash dividends paid (dividend coverage ratio). This measure reflects Williams’ distributable cash flow relative to its actual cash dividends paid.

This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of assets and the cash that the business is generating.

Neither Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, nor distributable cash flow are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations. They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
