 Item 1.01.  

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.   

Accelerated Share Repurchase Program  

On January 30, 2020, Citrix Systems, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a master confirmation (each a “Master ASR Confirmation”) and a supplemental confirmation (each a “Supplemental Confirmation” and, together with the related Master ASR Confirmation, an “ASR Agreement”), with each of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (each, an “ASR Counterparty”), as part of the Company’s share repurchase program. Under the ASR Agreements, the Company will pay a total of $1 billion to the ASR Counterparties and receive a total of approximately 6.53 million shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”) from the ASR Counterparties on January 31, 2020. The total number of shares of Common Stock that the Company will repurchase under each ASR Agreement will be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the Common Stock during the term of such ASR Agreement, less a discount. At settlement, each ASR Counterparty may be required to deliver additional shares of Common Stock to the Company or, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to deliver shares of Common Stock, at the Company’s election, or make a cash payment to the applicable ASR Counterparty.  

Each ASR Agreement contains the principal terms and provisions governing the accelerated share repurchase, including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the number of shares of Common Stock that will be delivered, the required timing of delivery of the shares, the circumstances under which the applicable ASR Counterparty is permitted to make adjustments to valuation and calculation periods, and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by the Company and the applicable ASR Counterparty to one another. Each ASR Agreement also provides that the applicable ASR Counterparty can terminate the transaction following the occurrence of certain specified events, including major corporate transactions involving the Company.  

The foregoing description of the ASR Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Master Confirmations (including the forms of Supplemental Confirmation), which are filed hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2 and are incorporated herein by reference.  

 Item 8.01.  

Other Events.   

On January 31, 2020, the Company issued a press release announcing that the Company has entered into the ASR Agreements. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
