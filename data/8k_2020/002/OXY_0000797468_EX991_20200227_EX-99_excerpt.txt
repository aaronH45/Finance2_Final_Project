HOUSTON — February 27, 2020 — Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) today announced a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2019 of $1.3 billion, or $1.50 per diluted share, and adjusted loss attributable to common stockholders of $269 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. Fourth quarter pre-tax items affecting comparability included a charge of approximately $1.0 billion to reflect Occidental’s investment in Western Midstream Partners, LP (WES) at fair value as of December 31, 2019, upon applying the equity method of accounting, Anadarko acquisition-related transaction costs of $656 million, and net gains on sale of $475 million related to Occidental’s Midland Basin joint venture with Ecopetrol and a sale of real estate assets. 

“The integration of our combined businesses is progressing extremely well and faster than expected as evidenced by our outstanding operational performance and we are ahead of schedule in capturing value from our $2 billion synergy program,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub. “We are advancing toward achieving our divestiture target of $15 billion and repaid $7 billion of debt within five months of closing the Anadarko acquisition. Deleveraging and returning excess free cash flow to shareholders remain key priorities, and we are highly confident in our ability to achieve both.” 

QUARTERLY RESULTS 

Oil and Gas 

Oil and gas pre-tax income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $921 million, compared to $221 million for the prior quarter. The fourth quarter results included $475 million in net gains on sale related to Occidental’s Midland Basin joint venture with Ecopetrol and a sale of real estate assets and a mark-to-market loss of $182 million on crude oil hedges. Excluding gains on sales and the mark-to-market loss, the increase in fourth quarter income reflected higher domestic crude oil volumes from a full quarter of production from the Anadarko acquisition, partially offset by lower international crude oil volumes. 

Total average daily production volume for the fourth quarter of 2019 exceeded guidance at 1,402,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOED) with Permian Resources production of 476,000 BOED due to continued improvement in well performance and reduction in downtime. International average daily production volumes also came in above guidance for the fourth quarter at 257,000 BOED. 

For the fourth quarter of 2019, average WTI and Brent marker prices were $56.96 per barrel and $62.50 per barrel, respectively. Average worldwide realized crude oil prices for the fourth quarter were $56.21, flat compared to the third quarter of 2019. Average worldwide realized NGL prices increased by 19 percent from the prior quarter to $17.78 per BOE. The increase in average domestic realized gas prices to $1.61 per Mcf during the fourth quarter of 2019 was due to a full quarter of production from legacy Anadarko gas-producing operations, which have higher realized prices. 

OxyChem 

Chemical pre-tax income for the fourth quarter exceeded guidance at $119 million. Compared to the prior quarter, the decline in fourth quarter income was primarily due to scheduled plant outages combined with softer overall demand, resulting in lower production and sales volumes across many product lines. 

Marketing and Midstream 

Occidental combined the operations of WES into the Marketing and Midstream operating segment. Marketing and Midstream pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter was $769 million, compared to income of $400 million for the third quarter of 2019. Fourth quarter pre-tax income included a $1.0 billion charge to reflect Occidental’s investment in WES at fair value as of December 31, 2019, upon applying the equity method of accounting. Excluding these charges, the decrease in fourth quarter pre-tax income reflected lower marketing results due to non-cash mark-to-market losses, the tightening of the Midland to MEH differential, and lower equity investment income due to the sale of the equity interests in Plains in the third quarter of 2019. 

Supplemental Non-GAAP Measure 

This press release refers to adjusted income, a supplemental measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). A definition of adjusted income and a reconciliation to net income, the comparable GAAP financial measure, is included in the financial schedules of this press release. Occidental’s definition of adjusted income may differ from similarly titled measures provided by other companies in our industry and as a result may not be comparable.

(a) Non-GAAP Measure 

Adjusted income is a non-GAAP measure. Occidental defines adjusted income as net income excluding the effects of significant transactions and events that affect earnings but vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. These events may recur, even across successive reporting periods. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management’s performance, but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental’s earnings performance between periods. Reported net income is considered representative of management’s performance over the long term, and adjusted income is not considered to be an alternative to net income reported in accordance with GAAP. 

SCHEDULE 4

Segment Results After Tax Allocations 

(Amounts in millions, except per share amounts)  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The difference between reported average diluted shares outstanding and adjusted average diluted shares outstanding is immaterial and does not impact the calculation of adjusted earnings per share. As such, adjusted earnings per share is calculated as adjusted income (loss) divided by reported average diluted shares outstanding.
