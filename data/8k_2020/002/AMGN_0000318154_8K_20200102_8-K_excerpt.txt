As previously disclosed in Amgen’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on October 31, 2019, Amgen entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with BeiGene, Ltd. (“BeiGene”) and a Collaboration Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with BeiGene Switzerland GmbH (“BeiGene Switzerland”). On December 6, 2019, Amgen and BeiGene entered into an amendment (the “SPA Amendment”) to the Share Purchase Agreement to allow Amgen to subscribe for, and the Company to allot and issue to Amgen, securities representing an additional number of ordinary shares in an amount not to exceed five million ordinary shares in order to allow Amgen to hold up to 20.5% of the Company’s outstanding share capital as of a date four business days prior to the closing.  

On January 2, 2020, Amgen closed its purchase of 15,895,001 BeiGene American Depositary Shares, each representing 13 BeiGene ordinary shares, under the amended Share Purchase Agreement. Concurrently with such closing, the Collaboration Agreement became effective.
