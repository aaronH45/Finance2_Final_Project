CHICAGO, January 29, 2020 – The Boeing Company [NYSE: BA] reported fourth-quarter revenue of $17.9 billion, GAAP loss per share of ($1.79) and core loss per share (non-GAAP)* of ($2.33), primarily reflecting the impacts of the 737 MAX grounding (Table 1). Boeing recorded operating cash flow of ($2.2) billion and paid $1.2 billion of dividends.

"We recognize we have a lot of work to do," said Boeing President and Chief Executive Officer David Calhoun. “We are focused on returning the 737 MAX to service safely and restoring the long-standing trust that the Boeing brand represents with the flying public. We are committed to transparency and excellence in everything we do. Safety will underwrite every decision, every action and every step we take as we move forward. Fortunately, the strength of our overall Boeing portfolio of businesses provides the financial liquidity to follow a thorough and disciplined recovery process.”

Segment Results

Commercial Airplanes

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Commercial Airplanes fourth-quarter revenue was $7.5 billion and fourth-quarter operating margin decreased to (38.1) percent reflecting lower 737 deliveries and an additional pre-tax charge of $2.6 billion related to estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers related to the 737 MAX grounding (Table 4). The estimated costs to produce 737 aircraft included in the accounting quantity increased by $2.6 billion during the quarter, primarily to reflect updated production and delivery assumptions. In addition, the suspension of 737 MAX production and a gradual resumption of production at low production rates will result in approximately $4 billion of abnormal production costs that will be expensed as incurred, primarily in 2020.

Commercial Airplanes delivered 79 airplanes during the quarter, including 45 787's, and captured orders for 30 737 MAX aircraft at the Dubai Air Show and 2 777 freighters for Lufthansa. The 787 program also booked 36 net orders in the quarter. As previously announced, the 787 production rate will be reduced from the current rate of 14 airplanes per month to 12 airplanes per month in late 2020. Based on the current environment and near-term market outlook, the production rate is expected to be further adjusted to 10 airplanes per month in early 2021, and return to 12 airplanes per month in 2023. The first flight of the 777X was completed on January 25, and first delivery is targeted for 2021.

Commercial Airplanes backlog included over 5,400 airplanes valued at $377 billion.

Defense, Space & Security

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Defense, Space & Security fourth-quarter revenue decreased to $6.0 billion primarily driven by lower volume across the portfolio as well as the impact of a Commercial Crew charge (Table 5). Fourth-quarter operating margin decreased to 0.5 percent due to a $410 million pre-tax Commercial Crew charge primarily to provision for an additional uncrewed mission for the Commercial Crew program, performance and mix. NASA is evaluating the data received during the December 2019 mission to determine if another uncrewed mission is required.

During the quarter, Defense, Space & Security received an award for 10 Space Launch System core stages and up to 8 Exploration Upper Stages. Defense, Space & Security also received contracts for the remanufacture of 47 AH-64E Apache helicopters for three countries and to upgrade the NATO Airborne Warning & Control System fleet. Significant milestones achieved during the quarter included the delivery of the first modified MV-22 Osprey to the U.S. Marine Corps and delivery of the first P-8A Poseidon aircraft to the United Kingdom Royal Air Force. Defense, Space & Security also conducted a Commercial Crew spacecraft uncrewed Orbital Flight Test.

 Backlog at Defense, Space & Security was $64 billion, of which 29 percent represents orders from customers outside the U.S.

Global Services

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Global Services fourth-quarter revenue was $4.6 billion, primarily driven by lower commercial services volume (Table 6). Fourth-quarter operating margin decreased to 14.7 percent primarily due to a charge related to the retirement of the Aviall brand and mix of products and services, partially offset by a gain on divestiture.

During the quarter, Global Services was awarded V-22 support contracts for Japan and the U.S. and AH-64 and CH-47 global support for the U.S. Army. Global Services signed a multi-year Landing Gear Exchange services agreement with LATAM Airlines Group and a 5-year digital navigation renewal agreement with Saudi Arabian Airlines. Global Services also expanded its digital offerings by launching ForeFlight Dispatch and signed a contract with Flexjet to be the inaugural customer.

Additional Financial Information

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

At quarter-end, Boeing Capital's net portfolio balance was $2.3 billion. Revenue in other unallocated items and eliminations decreased primarily due to the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries. The change in earnings from other unallocated items and eliminations is primarily due to higher deferred compensation expense and increased enterprise research and development investment. Interest and debt expense increased due to higher debt balances. The fourth quarter 2019 effective tax rate reflects a $371 million tax benefit related to the settlement of state tax audits as well as the impact of pre-tax losses.

Non-GAAP Measures Disclosures

We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company’s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided: 

Core Operating (Loss)/Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core (Loss)/Earnings Per Share 

Core operating (loss)/earnings is defined as GAAP (loss)/earnings from operations excluding the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core operating margin is defined as core operating (loss)/earnings expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core (loss)/earnings per share is defined as GAAP diluted (loss)/earnings per share excluding the net (loss)/earnings per share impact of the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to Commercial Airplanes and BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating (loss)/earnings, core operating margin and core (loss)/earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core (loss)/earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude non-service pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided on page 13-14. 

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is GAAP operating cash flow reduced by capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. Table 2 provides a reconciliation of free cash flow to GAAP operating cash flow.
