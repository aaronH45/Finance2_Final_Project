Annual Incentive Plan

On January 29, 2020, the Organization and Compensation Committee (the O&C Committee) of the Board of Directors of DTE Energy Company (DTE Energy or the Company) approved 2020 performance measures, weightings and metrics under the Company’s Annual Incentive Plan (AIP). Gerard M. Anderson, Peter B. Oleksiak, Trevor F. Lauer, David E. Meador and Gerardo Norcia are the Company’s “named executive officers” disclosed in the Company’s 2019 proxy statement (NEOs).

The following table summarizes the annual measures for 2020 under the AIP for Messrs. Anderson, Oleksiak, Meador and Norcia in determining their total annual incentive award:

The following table summarizes the annual measures for 2020 under the AIP for Mr. Lauer in determining his total annual incentive award:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Based on market comparisons, each officer position is assigned a target award expressed as a percentage of base salary. For 2020, targets for these officers range from 75% to 120%, including Mr. Norcia, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Award amounts paid to each AIP participant are determined as follows: (1) the executive’s most recent year-end base salary is multiplied by an AIP target percentage to arrive at the target award; (2) the overall performance payout percentage, which can range from 0% to 175%, is determined based on final results compared to threshold, target and maximum levels for each objective; (3) the target award is then multiplied by the performance payout percentage to arrive at the calculated award; and (4) the calculated award is then adjusted by an individual performance modifier (assessment of an individual executive’s achievements for the year), which can range from 0% to 150%, to arrive at the final award amount.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

On January 29, 2020, the O&C Committee approved 2022 performance measures, weightings and metrics for executive officers, including the NEOs, under the DTE Energy Company Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The LTIP, which was approved by our shareholders, rewards long-term growth and profitability by providing a vehicle through which officers, other key employees and outside directors may receive stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation directly links individual performance with shareholder interests. Based on market comparisons, each officer position is assigned a target award expressed as a percentage of base salary. The target award may be modified by the O&C Committee and is then delivered in the form of restricted stock, stock options and performance shares. For long term incentive awards granted in 2020, which pay out in 2023, targets for these officers range from 215% to 450%, including the President and Chief Executive Officer.

Performance shares: Performance shares entitle the executive to receive a specified number of shares, or a cash payment equal to the fair market value of the shares, or a combination thereof, depending on the level of achievement of performance measures. The performance measurement period for the 2022 award is January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Payments earned under the 2022 award can range from 0% to 200% of target, based upon achievement of performance measures. The two measures and weightings for Messrs. Anderson, Oleksiak, Meador and Norcia are: (1) total shareholder return vs. total shareholder return of peer group companies (80%), and (2) ratio of funds from operations to debt (20%). The three measures and weightings for Mr. Lauer are: (1) total shareholder return vs. total shareholder return of peer group companies (60%), (2) ratio of funds from operations to debt (20%), and (3) DTE Electric 3-year average return on equity (20%).
