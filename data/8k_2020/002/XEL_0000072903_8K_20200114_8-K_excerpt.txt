Item 8.01. Other Events

In July 2019, Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS), a New Mexico corporation, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., filed an electric rate case with the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission seeking an increase in retail electric base rates of approximately $51 million. The rate request is based on a return on equity (ROE) of 10.35%, an equity ratio of 54.77%, a rate base of approximately $1.3 billion and a historic test year with rate base additions through Aug. 31, 2019. In December 2019, SPS revised its base rate increase request to approximately $47 million, based on a ROE of 10.10% and updated information. The request also included an increase of $14.6 million for accelerated depreciation including the early retirement of the Tolk Coal Plant in 2032. 

On Jan. 13, 2020, SPS and various parties filed an uncontested comprehensive stipulation, which includes the following terms:

•A base rate revenue increase of $31 million;

•An ROE of 9.45%;

•An equity ratio of 54.77%; and

•An acceleration of depreciation on the Tolk Coal Plant to reflect early retirement in 2037, which results in a total increase in depreciation expense of $8 million. The Signatories will not oppose the full application of depreciation rates associated with the 2032 retirement date in SPS’s next base rate case. 

Hearings are scheduled to begin Feb. 17, 2020 and can continue until Feb. 21, 2020, as necessary. SPS anticipates final rates will go into effect in the second or third quarter of 2020.
