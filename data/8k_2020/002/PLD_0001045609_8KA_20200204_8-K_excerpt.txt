Introductory Note. 

This Form 8-K/A is being filed for the purpose of filing the financial statements and pro forma financial information required by Item 9.01 with respect to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P., on February 4, 2020 in connection with the consummation on February 4, 2020 (the “Closing Date”) of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 27, 2019 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Prologis, Inc., a Maryland corporation (“Prologis”), Prologis, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“Prologis OP”), Lambda REIT Acquisition LLC, a Maryland limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Prologis (“Prologis Merger Sub”), Lambda OP Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Prologis OP (“Prologis OP Merger Sub”), Liberty Property Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (“LPT”), Leaf Holdco Property Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust and a wholly owned subsidiary of LPT (“New Liberty Holdco”), and Liberty Property Limited Partnership, a Pennsylvania limited partnership (“LPT OP”). 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (a) on February 3, 2020, a wholly owned subsidiary of New Liberty Holdco merged with and into LPT, with LPT surviving the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of New Liberty Holdco (the “LPT Merger”), (b) on February 4, 2020, New Liberty Holdco merged with and into Prologis Merger Sub, with Prologis Merger Sub surviving the merger and remaining a wholly owned subsidiary of Prologis (the “Topco Merger” and, together with the LPT Merger, the “LPT Mergers”), (c) immediately thereafter, all of the outstanding equity interests in LPT were contributed to Prologis OP in exchange for the issuance by Prologis OP of partnership interests in Prologis OP to other subsidiaries of Prologis, and (d) immediately thereafter, Prologis OP Merger Sub merged with and into LPT OP, with LPT OP surviving the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Prologis OP (the “Partnership Merger” and, together with the LPT Mergers, the “Mergers”). 

Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on February 3, 2020, at the effective time of the LPT Merger (the “LPT Merger Effective Time”), each common share, par value $0.001 per share, of LPT (each, an “LPT Common Share”) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the LPT Merger Effective Time was automatically converted into the right to receive one common share of beneficial interest, par value $0.001 per share, of New Liberty Holdco (each, a “New Liberty Holdco Common Share”). Also at the LPT Merger Effective Time, each outstanding equity award relating to LPT Common Shares was automatically converted into an equivalent award relating to an equal number of New Liberty Holdco Common Shares. 

On February 4, 2020, at the effective time of the Topco Merger (the “Topco Merger Effective Time”), each New Liberty Holdco Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Topco Merger Effective Time (other than New Liberty Holdco Common Shares owned by New Liberty Holdco or any of New Liberty Holdco’s wholly owned subsidiaries and New Liberty Holdco Common Shares owned by Prologis or any of Prologis’ wholly owned subsidiaries) was automatically converted into the right to receive 0.675 (the “Exchange Ratio”) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Prologis (“Prologis Common Stock”, and such consideration, the “Merger Consideration”), together with cash in lieu of fractional shares, without interest, but subject to any withholding required under applicable law, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

Also at the Topco Merger Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock award, restricted stock unit award, and stock option relating to New Liberty Holdco Common Shares fully vested and was cancelled in exchange for a payment of the Merger Consideration (or a cash payment equal to the value of the Merger Consideration, in the case of an award that was payable in cash by its terms) in respect of each underlying New Liberty Holdco Common Share (reduced by the aggregate exercise price in the case of each stock option). Performance-based restricted stock unit awards vested based on the actual level of achievement of the applicable performance goals through the day immediately prior to the Topco Merger Effective Time (or, in the case of awards granted in 2017, based on actual performance during the completed performance period). 

Approximately 107,038,683 shares of Prologis Common Stock were issued in connection with the Topco Merger. 

On February 4, 2020, at the effective time of the Partnership Merger (the “Partnership Merger Effective Time”), (a) the general partner interests in LPT OP as of immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time remained general partnership interests in LPT OP, (b) each limited partnership interest of LPT OP (each, an “LPT Common OP Unit”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time was automatically converted into new validly issued common limited partnership interests in Prologis OP in an amount equal to the Exchange Ratio and each holder of LPT Common OP Units was admitted as a limited partner of Prologis OP in accordance with the terms of Prologis OP’s partnership agreement, and (c) each of the partnership interests in LPT OP designated as “6.25% Series I-2 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Interest” under the partnership agreement of LPT OP (each, an “LPT Preferred OP Unit”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time was automatically converted into one new validly issued limited partnership interest in Prologis OP designated as “6.25% Series T Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Unit” with substantially the same terms and rights as the LPT Preferred OP Units immediately prior to the Partnership Merger (“New Preferred OP Units”) and each holder of New Preferred OP Units was admitted as a limited partner of Prologis OP in accordance with the terms of Prologis OP’s partnership agreement. Prologis, as general partner of Prologis OP, caused the Prologis OP partnership agreement to be amended to create and authorize such New Preferred OP Units. 

Approximately 2,287,907 Prologis OP common limited partnership units and 213,440 Prologis OP preferred units were issued in connection with the Partnership Merger.  

The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year 

Prologis, L.P. 

In connection with the Mergers, on February 4, 2020, Prologis, as the general partner of Prologis OP, caused Prologis OP to adopt the Third Amendment to the Thirteenth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Prologis, L.P. to provide for the issuance of limited partnership interests of Prologis OP designated as “6.25% Series T Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units” and to make certain other administrative changes.
