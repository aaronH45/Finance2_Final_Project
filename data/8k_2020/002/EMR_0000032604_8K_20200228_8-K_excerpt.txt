Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure

The following information is furnished pursuant to Regulation FD.

Emerson Expectation for Coronavirus Impact to Revenue

First and foremost, we are prioritizing the health and safety of our employees. Our thoughts continue to be with the communities and individuals most affected by this disease.

During our recent Investor Conference on February 13, 2020, we discussed Emerson's operational, supply chain and logistics status in China. At that time, we estimated that the coronavirus (COVID-19) would negatively impact second quarter sales by $75 million to $100 million. We also stated that we would give an update by the end of the month.

We now estimate the impact to second quarter sales will be at least $100 million to $150 million, with half of that value currently expected to be recovered in the fiscal year. However, the longer the coronavirus endures, the lower the likelihood of sales recovery this year.

For the full year, the ultimate impact of coronavirus in China and globally is uncertain. We are continuing to monitor and evaluate the impact of this evolving situation.

Operational Metrics

Within China, all Emerson key facilities are currently operational, with ~85 percent production capacity available on average. The vast majority of our supply chain (over 95 percent) has restarted production, with current average capacity of ~57 percent, and steadily increasing. Logistics still present a challenge. Material is moving but at ~75 percent of the normal rate. Additionally, transit times are delayed and costing rates are predictably higher.

Upcoming Investor Events 

On Tuesday, May 5, 2020, Emerson will report its second quarter 2020 results prior to market open. Emerson senior management will discuss the results during an investor conference call that same day, likely beginning at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time, 1:00 p.m. Central Time. Participants can access a live webcast available at www.emerson.com/financial at the time of the call. A replay of the call will remain available for 90 days. Additionally, conference call slides will be posted in advance of the call on the website.
