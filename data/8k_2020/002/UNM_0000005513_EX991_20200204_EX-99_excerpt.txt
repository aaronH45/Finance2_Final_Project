RESULTS BY SEGMENT

We measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of "adjusted operating income" or "adjusted operating loss", which differ from income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and certain other items. These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for income before income tax or net income. 

Unum US Segment 

Unum US reported adjusted operating income of $263.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 5.8 percent from $248.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Premium income for the segment increased 5.1 percent to $1,508.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to premium income of $1,435.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Net investment income for the segment increased 0.7 percent to $189.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $187.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported a 2.9 percent increase in adjusted operating income to $83.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $80.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Premium income for the group disability line of business increased 5.7 percent to $657.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $622.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, driven by prior period sales growth in both product lines and higher persistency in the group short-term disability product line. Net investment income was $103.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was generally consistent with the $102.7 million of net investment income in the fourth quarter of 2018. The benefit ratio for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 74.0 percent, compared to 76.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, due primarily to favorable claim recovery experience in the group long-term disability product line, partially offset by higher claims incidence. Group long-term disability sales were $132.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of 10.3 percent from $147.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Group short-term disability sales were $81.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $80.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Premium income for this line of business increased 4.8 percent to $454.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $433.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, due primarily to prior period sales growth. Net investment income increased 6.5 percent to $27.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $26.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, due primarily to a higher level of invested assets and higher miscellaneous investment income, partially offset by a decline in yield on invested assets. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 71.7 percent, compared to 71.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018. Sales of group life and accidental death and dismemberment products decreased 13.6 percent in the fourth

Premium income for the supplemental and voluntary line of business increased 4.5 percent to $396.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $379.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. This increase was driven primarily by prior period sales growth and the continued expansion of our dental and vision product line, partially offset by unfavorable persistency across all business lines. Net investment income decreased 1.4 percent to $58.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $58.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, due to a decline in yield on invested assets, partially offset by growth in the level of invested assets. The benefit ratio for the individual disability product line was 50.6 percent for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to 51.2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2018, due to a lower average claim size and favorable claim recoveries. The benefit ratio for the voluntary benefits product line was 45.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to 43.6 percent for the fourth quarter of 2018, due to unfavorable claims experience across all product lines. The benefit ratio for the dental and vision product line was 71.1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to 67.3 percent for the fourth quarter of 2018, due to higher utilization.

Premium income was £113.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 8.6 percent from £104.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, driven by higher overall persistency, sales growth, and the impact of rate increases in the group long-term disability product line. Net investment income was £20.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of 8.7 percent from £22.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, due to lower investment income from inflation index-linked bonds, which we invest in to support the claim reserves associated with certain of our group policies that provide for inflation-linked increases in benefits, and a lower yield on fixed-rate bonds, partially offset by a higher level of invested assets. The benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 77.3 percent, compared to 74.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, due to unfavorable claims experience in both the group long-term disability and group life product lines partially offset by lower inflation-linked increases in benefits.

percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to an interest adjusted loss ratio of 83.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, driven primarily by favorable claims incidence in the fourth quarter of 2018.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measure of "after-tax adjusted operating income" differs from net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and certain other items as specified in the reconciliations in the 

UNUM IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK AND MARKETING BRAND OF UNUM GROUP AND ITS INSURING SUBSIDIARIES.5

Financial Highlights section below. We believe after-tax adjusted operating income is a better performance measure and better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.

Realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments. Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses. Although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities.

We may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals. We exclude these items as we believe them to be infrequent or unusual in nature, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability.

Information reconciling the Company’s outlook on after-tax adjusted operating income growth per share to the comparable GAAP financial measure is not provided. The only amounts excluded from after-tax adjusted operating income are those described in the preceding paragraphs. The Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty realized investment gains and losses, which are affected by overall market conditions and also by factors such as an economic or political change in the country of the issuer, a regulatory change pertaining to the issuer’s industry, a significant improvement or deterioration in the cash flows of the issuer, unforeseen accounting irregularities or fraud committed by an issuer, movement in credit spreads, ratings upgrades or downgrades, a change in the issuer’s marketplace or business prospects, or any other event that significantly affects the issuers of the fixed maturity securities which the Company holds in its investment portfolio.
