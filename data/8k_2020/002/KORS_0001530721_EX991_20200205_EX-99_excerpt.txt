Capri Holdings Limited Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Results

 Third Quarter Revenue and Adjusted Earnings Per Share Exceed Expectations

London — February 5, 2020 — Capri Holdings Limited (NYSE:CPRI), a global fashion luxury group, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 ended December 28, 2019.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Highlights

•Third quarter revenue growth of 9.2% 

•Third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.66

•Repaid approximately $300 million of debt in the third quarter, and approximately $500 million year-to-date

John D. Idol, the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "For the third quarter, we were pleased to deliver revenue and earnings per share above our expectations. Our revenue increase reflected the addition of Versace and growth from Jimmy Choo, while Michael Kors revenue was better than anticipated. The strategic initiatives for our recent acquisitions, Versace and Jimmy Choo, continue to gain traction, and we believe we are on the right path to position Michael Kors for future growth. Longer term, as we continue to execute against our strategies, we are confident in our ability to deliver multiple years of revenue and earnings growth."

Mr. Idol continued, “We are in the midst of a dynamic global health emergency related to the coronavirus. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the people of China, including our own employees located in this region, as well as all of those affected by the virus globally. We hope for a speedy and positive resolution to this crisis. The situation in China and the measures being taken to protect the population are having a material impact on our business. Given our current visibility, we now anticipate annual revenue of approximately $5.65 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.45 to $4.50. This estimate could materially change if the severity of the situation in China worsens."

Outlook

The following guidance is provided on an adjusted, non-GAAP basis. 

Full Year Fiscal 2020 Outlook

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, there has been an outbreak of coronavirus in China which the Company expects will materially impact its financial results. As of February 5, 2020, approximately 150 of the Company’s 225 stores in mainland China are closed. Additionally, most of the stores that remain open are operating with reduced hours and experiencing significant declines in customer traffic. While this global health emergency is expected to be temporary, the duration and intensity of the disruption is uncertain, including potential broader impact outside of China if travel and tourist traffic is further restricted and there is a resulting decline in Chinese tourist spending in other regions. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the Company currently expects the situation in China to reduce revenue by approximately $100 million and earnings per share by $0.40 to $0.45 for the fourth quarter and full year. This estimate could materially change if the severity of the situation worsens, including potential broader impact on our business outside the region if outbound travel and tourist traffic is further restricted out of China and into other countries and regions.  In addition, given the lower than normal visibility, the Company will not be providing brand comparable store sales guidance ranges in the fourth quarter.

For Capri Holdings, the Company expects the following.

•Total revenue of approximately $5.65 billion

•Operating margin of approximately 13.7%

•Net interest expense in a range of $15 million to $20 million

•Weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 152 million

•Effective tax rate of approximately 9.5%

•Diluted earnings per share of $4.45 to $4.50

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 Outlook

For Capri Holdings, the Company expects the following.

•Total revenue of approximately $1.3 billion 

•Operating margin of approximately 9.0%

•Net interest expense of approximately $0 million

•Weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 152 million

•Effective tax rate of approximately 7%

•Diluted earnings per share of $0.68 to $0.73

For Versace, the Company expects the following.

•Revenue of approximately $210 million

•Positive operating margin reflecting an additional month in the quarter, December, partially offset by increased investments to support growth initiatives

For Jimmy Choo, the Company expects the following.

•Revenue of approximately $130 million

•Operating margin improvement reflecting expense leverage and the normalization of strategic investments

For Michael Kors, the Company expects the following.

•Revenue of approximately $950 million

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Constant currency effects are non-GAAP financial measures, which are provided to supplement our reported operating results to facilitate comparisons of our operating results and trends in our business, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Because we are a global company, foreign currency exchange rates may have a significant effect on our reported results. We calculate constant currency measures and the related foreign currency impacts by translating the current year’s reported amounts into comparable amounts using prior year’s foreign exchange rates for each currency. All constant currency performance measures discussed below should be considered a supplement to and not in lieu of our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, this earnings release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures relating to certain one-time costs associated with the Jimmy Choo and Versace acquisitions, restructuring and non-cash impairment charges, transformation costs and ERP implementation costs. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures, among other things, to evaluate its operating performance and in order to represent the manner in which the Company conducts and views its business. The Company believes that excluding non-recurring items helps its management and investors compare operating performance based on its ongoing operations. While the Company considers the non-GAAP measures to be useful supplemental measures in analyzing its results, they are not intended to replace, nor act as a substitute for, any amounts presented in its consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies.
