Article III, Section 8 of the Bylaws was amended to clarify that after any action taken without a meeting by the consent of all Board or committee members in writing or by electronic transmission, the consents will be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board or committee in the same paper or electronic form as the minutes are maintained. Article V, Section 2 of the Bylaws was amended to permit any signature on a stock certificate to be in electronic format. Article VIII, Sections 2, 5, and 9 of the Bylaws were amended to clarify coverage of the indemnification and insurance provisions with respect to trustees of the Company. In addition, Article VIII, Sections 3(a) and 8 of the Bylaws were amended to correct internal references to other Sections in the Article.

The above description of the amendments to the Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, as amended and restated, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
