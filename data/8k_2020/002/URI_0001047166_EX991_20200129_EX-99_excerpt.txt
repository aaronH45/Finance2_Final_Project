United Rentals Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Results

Introduces 2020 Outlook and Announces New $500 Million Share Repurchase Program

STAMFORD, Conn. – January 29, 2020 – United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE: URI) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 20191. 

Fourth Quarter 2019

Total revenue increased 6.5% to $2.456 billion and rental revenue increased 3.7% to $2.062 billion. On a GAAP basis, the company reported fourth quarter net income of $338 million, or $4.49 per diluted share ("EPS"), compared with $310 million, or $3.80 per diluted share, for the same period in 2018. Diluted EPS for the quarter increased 18.2% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS2 for the quarter increased 15.5% year-over-year to $5.60. 

Adjusted EBITDA2 increased 3.3% year-over-year to $1.154 billion, while adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 140 basis points to 47.0%. On a pro forma basis, year-over-year, net income excluding merger costs recognized by BlueLine prior to acquisition increased 9.4%, adjusted EBITDA increased 0.8% and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 130 basis points.

Matthew Flannery, chief executive officer of United Rentals, said, “Our fourth quarter contributed to a solid year of profitable growth and returns. Results were driven by growth in our core construction end-markets, while challenges in our industrial verticals impacted both revenue and margins in the quarter. For the year, we grew pro forma rental revenue and adjusted EBITDA by over 4%, while integrating our acquisitions, and generated free cash flow of almost $1.6 billion.”

Flannery continued, “Our 2020 outlook reflects the profitable growth we expect to deliver in what is forecasted to be a slower growth phase of this continuing upcycle. We are well positioned to support our customers across the end-markets we serve, while remaining disciplined in our approach to capex. We expect to generate higher free cash flow this year, which is earmarked to pay down debt and buy back shares.”

2020 Outlook

The company provided the following outlook for 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) 

ROIC was 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared with 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018. ROIC exceeded the company’s current weighted average cost of capital of less than 8.0%. The company’s ROIC metric uses after-tax operating income for the trailing 12 months divided by average stockholders’ equity, debt and deferred taxes, net of average cash. To mitigate the volatility related to fluctuations in the company’s tax rate from period to period, the U.S. federal corporate statutory tax rate of 21% was used to calculate after-tax operating income.

Share Repurchase Programs

In December 2019, the company completed its previously announced $1.25 billion share repurchase program, through which it acquired approximately 9.5 million shares. Over the course of the program's 18 month authorization, the company reduced its shares outstanding by 10.3%.

On January 28, 2020, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program which will commence in the first quarter of 2020. The company intends to complete the new share repurchase program over twelve months.

Conference Call 

United Rentals will hold a conference call tomorrow, Thursday, January 30, 2020, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The conference call number is 855-458-4217 (international: 574-990-3618). The conference call will also be available live by audio webcast at unitedrentals.com, where it will be archived until the next earnings call. The replay number for the call is 404-537-3406, passcode is 8349295.

_______________

7.Information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to the comparable GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort, as discussed below.

Non-GAAP Measures  

Free cash flow, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share (adjusted EPS) are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are presented on as-reported and pro forma bases. Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of, and plus proceeds from, equipment. The equipment purchases and proceeds represent cash flows from investing activities. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. Adjusted EPS represents EPS plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, the impact on depreciation related to acquired fleet and property and equipment, the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet, merger related intangible asset amortization, asset impairment charge and the loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities and amendment of ABL facility. The company believes that: (i) free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements; (ii) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced; and (iii) adjusted EPS provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, none of these measures should be considered as alternatives to net income, cash flows from operating activities or earnings per share under GAAP as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. 

Information reconciling forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures is unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The company is not able to provide reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as the provision for income taxes. Preparation of such reconciliations would require a forward-looking balance sheet, statement of income and statement of cash flow, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such forward-looking financial statements are unavailable to the company without unreasonable effort. The company provides a range for its adjusted EBITDA forecast that it believes will be achieved, however it cannot accurately predict all the components of the adjusted EBITDA calculation. The company provides an adjusted EBITDA forecast because it believes that adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the company’s results under GAAP, provides useful information for the reasons noted above. However, adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity.

These statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” “on-track,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend” or “anticipate,” or the negative thereof or comparable terminology, or by discussions of vision, strategy or outlook. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections, and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed, and actual results may differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the possibility that companies that we have acquired or may acquire, including BakerCorp and BlueLine, could have undiscovered liabilities or involve other unexpected costs, may strain our management capabilities or may be difficult to integrate; (2) the cyclical nature of our business, which is highly sensitive to North American construction and industrial activities; if construction or industrial activity decline, our revenues and, because many of our costs are fixed, our profitability may be adversely affected; (3) our significant indebtedness, which requires us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow for debt service and can constrain our flexibility in responding to unanticipated or adverse business conditions; (4) the inability to refinance our indebtedness on terms that are favorable to us, or at all; (5) the incurrence of additional debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness; (6) noncompliance with financial or other covenants in our debt agreements, which could result in our lenders terminating the agreements and requiring us to repay outstanding borrowings; (7) restrictive covenants and amount of borrowings permitted in our debt instruments, which can limit our financial and operational flexibility; (8) overcapacity of fleet in the equipment rental industry; (9) inability to benefit from government spending, including spending associated with infrastructure projects; (10) fluctuations in the price of our common stock and inability to complete stock repurchases in the time frame and/or on the terms anticipated; (11) rates we charge and time utilization we achieve being less than anticipated; (12) inability to manage credit risk adequately or to collect on contracts with a large number of customers; (13) inability to access the capital that our businesses or growth plans may require; (14) the incurrence of impairment charges; (15) trends in oil and natural gas could adversely affect the demand for our services and products; (16) the fact that our holding company structure requires us to depend in part on distributions from subsidiaries and such distributions could be limited by contractual or legal restrictions; (17) increases in our loss reserves to address business operations or other claims and any claims that exceed our established levels of reserves; (18) incurrence of additional expenses (including indemnification obligations) and other costs in connection with litigation, regulatory and investigatory matters; (19) the outcome or other potential consequences of regulatory matters and commercial litigation; (20) shortfalls in our insurance coverage; (21) our charter provisions as well as provisions of certain debt agreements and our significant indebtedness may have the effect of making more difficult or otherwise discouraging, delaying or deterring a takeover or other change of control of us; (22) turnover in our management team and inability to attract and retain key personnel; (23) costs we incur being more than anticipated and the inability to realize expected savings in the amounts or time frames planned; (24) our dependence on key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms; (25) inability to sell our new or used fleet in the amounts, or at the prices, we expect; (26) competition from existing and new competitors; (27) risks related to security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, failure to protect personal information, compliance with data protection laws and other significant disruptions in our information technology systems; (28) the costs of complying with environmental, safety and foreign law and regulations, as well as other risks associated with non-U.S. operations, including currency exchange risk (including as a result of Brexit), and tariffs; (29) labor disputes, work stoppages or other labor difficulties, which may impact our productivity, and potential enactment of new legislation or other changes in law affecting our labor relations and operations generally; (30) increases in our maintenance and replacement costs and/or decreases in the residual value of our equipment; and (31) the effect of changes in tax law.

RENTAL REVENUE

In January 2019, the company introduced fleet productivity as a comprehensive metric that provides greater insight into the decisions made by its managers in support of growth and returns. Specifically, the company seeks to optimize the interplay of rental rates, time utilization and mix in driving rental revenue. Fleet productivity aggregates, in one metric, the impact of changes in rates, utilization and mix on owned equipment rental revenue.

The company believes that this metric is useful in assessing the effectiveness of its decisions on rates, time utilization and mix, particularly as they support the creation of shareholder value. The table below shows the components of the year-over-year change in rental revenue using the fleet productivity methodology, presented on an actual and pro forma basis:

UNITED RENTALS, INC.

ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GAAP RECONCILIATION

We define “earnings per share – adjusted” as the sum of earnings per share – GAAP, as reported plus the impact of the following special items: merger related costs, merger related intangible asset amortization, impact on depreciation related to acquired fleet and property and equipment, impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet, restructuring charge, asset impairment charge and loss on repurchase/redemption of debt securities and amendment of ABL facility. Management believes that earnings per share - adjusted provides useful information concerning future profitability. However, earnings per share - adjusted is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, earnings per share - adjusted should not be considered an alternative to GAAP earnings per share. The table below provides a reconciliation between earnings per share – GAAP, as reported, and earnings per share – adjusted. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The tax rates applied to the adjustments reflect the statutory rates in the applicable entities.

(2)Reflects transaction costs associated with the BakerCorp and BlueLine acquisitions discussed above. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future. Merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions that significantly impact our operations. The historic acquisitions that have included merger related costs are RSC, which had annual revenues of approximately $1.5 billion prior to the acquisition, and National Pump, which had annual revenues of over $200 million prior to the acquisition. NES had annual revenues of approximately $369 million, Neff had annual revenues of approximately $413 million, BakerCorp had annual revenues of approximately $295 million and BlueLine had annual revenues of approximately $786 million.

(3)Reflects the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the RSC, National Pump, NES, Neff, BakerCorp and BlueLine acquisitions.

(4)Reflects the impact of extending the useful lives of equipment acquired in the RSC, NES, Neff, BakerCorp and BlueLine acquisitions, net of the impact of additional depreciation associated with the fair value mark-up of such equipment.

(5)Reflects additional costs recorded in cost of rental equipment sales associated with the fair value mark-up of rental equipment acquired in the RSC, NES, Neff and BlueLine acquisitions and subsequently sold. 

(6)Primarily reflects severance and branch closure charges associated with our closed restructuring programs and our current restructuring program. We only include such costs that are part of a restructuring program as restructuring charges. Since the first such restructuring program was initiated in 2008, we have completed four restructuring programs. We have cumulatively incurred total restructuring charges of $333 million under our restructuring programs.

(7)Reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets.

EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA GAAP RECONCILIATIONS

(In millions)

EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment, and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company’s results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliation, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. The table below provides a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(A) Our EBITDA margin was 45.6% and 45.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 44.9% and 45.1% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

(B) Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 47.0% and 48.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 46.6% and 48.0% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The pro forma information below for 2018 reflects the combination of United Rentals, BakerCorp and BlueLine. BakerCorp was acquired in July 2018 and was fully included in United Rentals' results for the three months ended December 31, 2018. Prior to our acquisitions of BakerCorp and BlueLine, BakerCorp and BlueLine management used different EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA definitions than those used by United Rentals. The information below reflects BakerCorp and BlueLine historical information presented in accordance with United Rentals’ definitions of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. The management of BakerCorp and BlueLine historically did not view EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as liquidity measures, and accordingly the information required to reconcile these measures to the statement of cash flows is unavailable to the company.

FREE CASH FLOW GAAP RECONCILIATION 

(In millions)

We define “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of, and plus proceeds from, equipment. The equipment purchases and proceeds are included in cash flows from investing activities. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements. However, free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. Accordingly, free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. The table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow.
