Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

On February 21, 2020, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Kellogg Company (the “Company”) made compensation determinations with respect to the Company’s named executive officers, and the Compensation and Talent Management Committee of the Board adopted the 2020-2022 Executive Performance Plan, each as set forth below.

2020-2022 Executive Performance Plan. The Compensation and Talent Management Committee of the Board approved the 2020-2022 Executive Performance Plan (“2020-2022 EPP”) under which certain senior executives would be eligible to receive a portion of their long-term incentives in the form of performance shares based on the achievement of organic net sales growth and aggregate operating cash flow. Awards are paid in shares at the end of the performance period, except for amounts withheld by the Company for statutory withholding requirements. In addition, the independent members of the Board granted 2020-2022 EPP target awards of 73,270 shares for Steve Cahillane; 17,630 shares for Amit Banati; 15,950 shares for Gary Pilnick; 20,150 shares for Chris Hood; and 10,690 shares for Alistair Hirst. Participants in the 2020-2022 EPP have the opportunity to earn between 0% and 200% of their EPP target. Dividend equivalents accrue and vest in accordance with the underlying EPP award. A copy of the 2020-2022 EPP is attached as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated in its entirety into this Item.

RSU Grants. The independent members of the Board approved the following grants of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to named executive officers of the Company: 8,820 for Mr. Banati; 7,980 RSUs for Mr. Pilnick; 10,080 RSUs for Mr. Hood; and 5,350 RSUs for Mr. Hirst. Awards are paid in shares when vesting requirements are met, except for amounts withheld by the Company for statutory withholding requirements. Dividend equivalents accrue and vest in accordance with the underlying RSU award. Under the terms of the grants, the RSUs vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. A copy of the form of RSU terms and conditions for the grants is attached as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated in its entirety into this Item.

Option Grants. The independent members of the Board approved the following grants of stock options to named executive officers of the Company: 244,280 options for Mr. Cahillane; 44,090 options for Mr. Banati; 39,890 options for Mr. Pilnick; 50,390 options for Mr. Hood; and 26,720 options for Mr. Hirst. The exercise price under these grants is $65.52 per share. Under the terms of the grants, the stock options vest in three equal annual installments from the anniversary of the grant date. A copy of the form of option terms and conditions for the grants is attached as Exhibit 10.3 and is incorporated in its entirety into this Item.

Executive Deferral Program. The Compensation and Talent Management Committee determined to eliminate the Company’s Executive Deferral Program, which currently requires senior executives to defer base salary above $950,000 into deferred stock units that are equivalent to the fair market value of the Company’s stock. The Program will terminate at the end of fiscal year 2020.
