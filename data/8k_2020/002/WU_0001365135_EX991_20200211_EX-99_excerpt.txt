 Exhibit 99.1  

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   

 Western Union Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results;   

 Increases Quarterly Dividend 13% on Strong Profit Outlook   

 Strong digital money transfer revenue growth  

 2019 operating cash flow of $915 million; over $1 billion adjusted 

Over $880 million of cash returned to shareholders in 2019  

 DENVER, February 11, 2020: The Western Union Company (NYSE: WU), a global leader in cross-border, cross-currency money movement and payments, today reported financial results for the 2019 fourth quarter and full year, and provided its financial outlook for 2020.  

 In the fourth quarter, the Company generated revenue of $1.3 billion, a decline of 7% on a reported basis or an increase of 3% in adjusted constant currency terms compared to the prior year period. The strengthening of the dollar against the Argentine peso negatively impacted reported revenue by approximately 2% in the quarter, while the effects of inflation on the Company’s Argentina-based businesses are estimated to have positively impacted revenue by approximately 1%.  

 GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $0.32 compared to $0.48 in the prior year period, and adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $0.38 compared to $0.51 in the prior year. The decline in both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share was primarily due to a higher effective tax rate, the impact of the divestiture of the Speedpay and Paymap businesses in May of 2019, and higher marketing investment compared to the prior year period, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. GAAP and adjusted tax rates in the fourth quarter of 2019 were the highest of the year, as expected, and were further increased by one-time settlements in certain geographies. The GAAP rate also included additional taxes associated with the May 2019 divestitures.  

 CEO Hikmet Ersek said, “I’m pleased with the progress of our business in the fourth quarter, as we continued to deliver strong digital growth and solid financial results. Importantly, we began implementing a number of initiatives from our new strategy and productivity program, and we start 

2020 with good momentum for achieving the 2022 targets we laid out at our September investor day.”  

 The Company’s 2020 financial outlook calls for margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth in the teens, and the Company increased its quarterly dividend by 13% to $0.225 per common share, payable March 31, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2020.  

 CFO Raj Agrawal said, “Our solid underlying performance and focus on efficiency in 2019 generated strong profits and cash flow that enabled us to return over $880 million to shareholders, through dividends and repurchases, while funding our growth strategy. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong financial performance in 2020 and beyond, and are pleased to announce an increase in our quarterly dividend.”   

 Q4 Business Unit Highlights  

   ·    Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) revenues, which represented 86% of total Company revenue in the quarter, were flat on a reported basis, or increased 1% constant currency, while transactions declined 1%. Geographically, constant currency revenue growth was driven by cross-border sends originated in Europe, the U.S. and Latin America, partially offset by declines in Asia Pacific, U.S. domestic money transfer, and certain countries with civil unrest, macro-economic, and market specific issues. 

 Digital money transfer revenues increased 24% on a reported basis, or 25% constant currency, in the quarter including westernunion.com and third-party white label digital services. Westernunion.com C2C revenues increased 17% on a reported basis and 18% on a constant currency basis, including cross-border revenue growth of 26%. Westernunion.com revenues represented 15% of total C2C revenue in the quarter and the service is now available in over 70 countries, plus additional territories, with bank account payout in over 100 countries and retail payout in over 200 countries and territories.   

   ·    Western Union Business Solutions revenue was flat on a reported basis, or increased 1% constant currency, with constant currency growth driven by strong performance generated from customers in Europe. Business Solutions represented 7% of total Company revenue in the quarter.

   ·    Other revenues, which primarily consist of retail bill payments businesses in the U.S. and Argentina, declined 52%. The reduction was due to the divestitures of the Speedpay and 

Paymap businesses in May of 2019 and the impact of the depreciation of the Argentine peso. Other revenues represented 7% of total Company revenue in the quarter. 

 Additional Q4 Financial Highlights  

   ·    GAAP operating margin in the quarter was 17.3% compared to 19.3% in the prior year period. The decline in operating margin was primarily due to higher marketing investment compared to the prior year period, the impact of the restructuring expense in the current quarter and the divestiture of Speedpay in May of 2019. 

   ·    Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 18.7% compared to 19.9% in the prior year period. The decrease in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to the higher marketing investment and the Speedpay divestiture. 

   ·    The GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 31.4% compared to 9.8% in the prior year period, while the adjusted tax rate was 24.5% compared to 6.8% in the prior year period. The GAAP and adjusted rates in the fourth quarter of 2018 included certain discrete benefits. GAAP and adjusted rates in the fourth quarter of 2019 were the highest of the year, as expected, and were further increased by one-time settlements in certain geographies. The GAAP rate also included additional taxes associated with the May 2019 divestitures. 

   ·    The Company returned $149 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter, consisting of $65 million in share repurchases and $84 million of dividends.  

 2019 Full Year Financial Highlights  

   ·    The Company’s full year revenue declined 5%, or increased 3% on an adjusted constant currency basis, compared to the prior year. The strengthening of the dollar against the Argentine peso reduced reported revenue growth by approximately 3%, while the impact of inflation on the Company’s Argentina-based businesses is estimated to have positively impacted revenue growth by approximately 2%. 

   ·    GAAP operating margin was 17.6% compared to 20.1% in the prior year. The reduction in GAAP operating margin was primarily due to the impact of restructuring expense and the divestiture of the Speedpay business. 

   ·    Adjusted operating margin was 20.1% compared to 20.3% in the prior year, which was down slightly due to higher marketing investment.  

   ·    The GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 19.9% compared to 14.1% in the prior year, which increased primarily due to the net gain on the sales of the Speedpay and Paymap businesses and various one-time net discrete benefits in the prior year period, after adjustments associated with the Tax Act. The adjusted tax rate of 19.7% for the full year compares to 12.0% for 2018, which primarily reflects various one-time discrete benefits in the prior year. 

   ·    GAAP earnings per share was $2.46 compared to $1.87 in the prior year. The increase in earnings per share was primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Speedpay business and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by the impact of restructuring expenses and a higher effective tax rate.  

   ·    Adjusted earnings per share was $1.73 compared to $1.95 in 2018. The decline in adjusted earnings per share was primarily due to a higher adjusted effective tax rate and the impact of the divestitures, which were partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. 

   ·    GAAP cash flow from operating activities for the year was $915 million, while adjusted operating cash flow was $1.1 billion for the year. The Company returned $881 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for the full year. 

 Financial Outlook   

 The Company is affirming its three-year financial targets including operating margin of approximately 23% in 2022 and a low double-digit EPS CAGR for the three years ending 2022*.  

 The Company expects the following outlook for 2020:   

 Revenue  

   ·    GAAP: flat to low single-digit decline, primarily due to the divestiture of our domestic bill payments business, Speedpay, in May 2019 

   ·    Adjusted constant currency: low single-digit increase, excluding any benefit related to Argentina inflation 

 * CAGR compared to 2019 adjusted EPS of $1.73  

 Operating Profit Margin  

   ·    GAAP operating margin of approximately 20% and adjusted operating margin of approximately 21% 

 Tax Rate  

   ·    GAAP and adjusted effective tax rate in a mid-teens range 

 Earnings per Share   

   ·    GAAP EPS in a range of $1.87 to $1.97  

   ·    Adjusted EPS in a range of $1.95 to $2.05  

 Cash Flow  

   ·    GAAP cash flow from operating activities of approximately $900 million 

   ·    Adjusted cash flow from operating activities of approximately $1.0 billion 

 Adjustment Items  

 Adjusted constant currency revenue growth metrics for 2020 are anticipated to exclude revenues for the Speedpay and Paymap businesses in the prior year period, each of which was divested in May 2019. Adjusted operating profit, tax rate, and earnings per share metrics for 2020 periods are anticipated to exclude restructuring expenses and acquisition and divestiture costs, net of related tax benefits, as applicable. Adjusted cash flow from operating activities for 2020 is anticipated to exclude the impact of payments for restructuring expenses and acquisition and divestiture costs, net of related tax payments.   

 Adjusted constant currency revenue metrics for 2019 exclude revenues for the Speedpay and Paymap businesses, which were each divested in May. Adjusted operating profit metrics for 2019 periods exclude restructuring expenses and acquisition and divestiture costs. Adjusted tax rate and earnings per share metrics for 2019 periods exclude the impact of the net gain on the Speedpay and Paymap divestitures, restructuring expenses, and acquisition and divestiture costs. Adjusted cash flow from operating activities for 2019 periods excludes the impact of payments for restructuring expenses, acquisition and divestiture costs, and taxes on the net gain on the Speedpay and Paymap divestitures, including the tax benefits related to base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT). Restructuring expenses are not included in operating segment results.  

 Although the Company has previously incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur restructuring costs in the future, these expenses are specific to the implementation of the new Global Strategy initiative and the Company has therefore provided adjusted financial results that exclude these expenses.  

 Adjusted constant currency revenue metrics for 2018 periods exclude revenues for the Speedpay and Paymap businesses, each of which was divested in May of 2019. Adjusted operating profit metrics exclude acquisition and divestiture costs. Adjusted tax rates and earnings per share for 2018 periods exclude the impacts of the acquisition and divestiture costs and tax expense related to changes in estimates for the provisional accounting for the Tax Act. These items have been excluded to provide comparability with 2019 adjusted metrics.  

 Additional Statistics  

 Additional key statistics for the quarter and historical trends can be found in the supplemental tables included with this press release.   

 All amounts included in the supplemental tables to this press release are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, the percentage changes and margins disclosed herein may not recalculate precisely using the rounded amounts provided.   

 Non-GAAP Measures  

 Western Union presents a number of non-GAAP financial measures because management believes that these metrics provide meaningful supplemental information in addition to the GAAP metrics and provide comparability and consistency to prior periods. Constant currency results assume foreign revenues are translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, net of the effect of foreign currency hedges, at rates consistent with those in the prior year.  

 These non-GAAP financial measures include the following: (1) consolidated revenue change constant currency adjusted and excluding Speedpay and Paymap, (2) Consumer-to-Consumer segment revenue change constant currency adjusted, (3) Consumer-to-Consumer segment westernunion.com and digital money transfer revenue change constant currency adjusted, (4) Business Solutions segment revenue change constant currency adjusted, (5) operating margin, excluding, as applicable, restructuring-related expenses and acquisition and divestiture costs, (6) diluted earnings per share, excluding, as applicable, restructuring-related expenses, acquisition and divestiture costs, gain on sales of Speedpay and Paymap, and Tax Act, (7) effective tax rate, excluding, as applicable, restructuring-related expenses, acquisition and divestiture costs, gain on sales of Speedpay and Paymap, and Tax Act, (8) cash flows from operating activities, adjusted, excluding, as applicable, cash payments related to restructuring-related expenses, acquisition and divestiture costs, and impact from tax payments related to net gain on Speedpay and Paymap divestiture, net of related reductions to tax payments, (9) operating margin outlook, adjusted, excluding restructuring-related expenses and acquisition and divestiture costs, (10) earnings per share outlook, adjusted, excluding restructuring-related expenses and acquisition and divestiture

 NOTES TO KEY STATISTICS  

 (in millions, unless indicated otherwise)  

 (Unaudited)  

 Western Union’s management believes the non-GAAP financial measures presented provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results to assist management, investors, analysts, and others in understanding our financial results and to better analyze trends in our underlying business because they provide consistency and comparability to prior periods. We have also included non-GAAP revenues that remove the impact of Speedpay and Paymap in order to provide a more meaningful comparison of results from continuing operations.  

 A non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP financial measure. A non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Users of the financial statements are encouraged to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included below. All adjusted year-over-year changes were calculated using prior year amounts.

 Non-GAAP related notes:  

   (r)    Represents the impact from the fluctuation in exchange rates between all foreign currency denominated amounts and the United States dollar. Constant currency results exclude any benefit or loss caused by foreign exchange fluctuations between foreign currencies and the United States dollar, net of foreign currency hedges, which would not have occurred if there had been a constant exchange rate. We believe that this measure provides management and investors with information about operating results and trends that eliminates currency volatility while increasing the comparability of our underlying results and trends. 

   (s)    On May 9, 2019, we completed the sale of our United States electronic bill payments business known as “Speedpay” to ACI Worldwide Corp. and ACW Worldwide, Inc. ("ACI") for approximately $750 million in cash. In the third quarter of 2019, the working capital calculation, pursuant to the divestiture agreement, was completed and resulted in a payment of approximately $21 million to ACI. In addition, on May 6, 2019, we completed the sale of Paymap Inc. ("Paymap"), which provides electronic mortgage bill payment services, for contingent consideration and immaterial cash proceeds received at closing. Both Speedpay and Paymap were included as a component of "Other" in our segment reporting. Revenue has been adjusted to exclude the carved out financial information for Speedpay and Paymap and the gain on the sales and the income taxes on the gain, including the elimination of previously forecasted annual base-erosion anti-abuse taxes, has been removed from adjusted net income and adjusted effective tax rate. Additionally, cash flows from operating activities have been adjusted to exclude taxes paid on the gain from Speedpay and Paymap divestitures, net of related reductions to previously expected base-erosion anti-abuse tax payments. These financial measures are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP measures. We have included this information because management believes that presenting these measures as adjusted to exclude divestitures will provide investors with a more meaningful comparison of results within the periods presented. Additionally, Speedpay and Paymap contributions to operating income exclude corporate overhead allocations. 

   (t)    Represents the impact to our provision for income taxes related to the December 2017 enactment of tax reform in the United States (“Tax Act”), primarily due to a tax on previously undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax balances to reflect the lower federal income tax rate, among other effects. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our accounting for the Tax Act. 

   (u)    Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”) results from taking operating income and adjusting for depreciation and amortization expenses. EBITDA results provide an additional performance measurement calculation which helps neutralize the operating income effect of assets acquired in prior periods. 

   (v)    Represents impact from expenses incurred in connection with an overall restructuring plan, approved by the Board of Directors on August 1, 2019, to improve our business processes and cost structure by reducing headcount and consolidating various facilities. While these expenses are identifiable to our business segments, primarily to our Consumer-to-Consumer segment, they have been excluded from the measurement of segment operating income provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocation. These expenses are therefore excluded from the Company's segment operating income results. Additionally, cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from operating activities outlook have been adjusted to exclude payments related to our restructuring plan, net of related tax benefits. While these expenses are specific to this initiative, the types of expenses related to this initiative are similar to expenses that we have previously incurred and can reasonably be expected to incur in the future. We believe that, by excluding the effects of these charges that can impact operating trends, management and investors are provided with a measure that increases the comparability of our underlying operating results.

   (w)    Represents the impact from expenses incurred in connection with our acquisition and divestiture activity, including the Speedpay and Paymap divestitures. These expenses have been excluded from operating and net income. Additionally, cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from operating activities outlook have been adjusted to exclude payments related to our acquisition and divestiture activity, net of related tax benefits. The 2018 and first quarter 2019 presentations have been recast to provide consistency with the second quarter 2019 and year-to-date 2019 presentations and exclude these expenses from our operating and net income. We believe that, by excluding the effects of these charges that can impact operating trends, management and investors are provided with a measure that increases the comparability of our underlying operating results.
