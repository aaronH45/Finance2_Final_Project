NEW YORK - Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) closed 2019 with strong fourth-quarter results highlighted by earnings growth and the most fourth-quarter phone net additions in six years. 

 "Verizon delivered strong operational performance in the fourth quarter, highlighted by continued wireless customer growth in both Consumer and Business," said Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg. "In 2019, Verizon drove innovation in 5G, established a new operating structure and delivered solid financial results. We entered 2020 with great momentum as we expand our network leadership and remain focused on the customer to provide a best-in-class experience. Our 5G footprint continues to grow as we lead this era of transformational change by building these next-generation networks the right way." 

For fourth-quarter 2019, Verizon reported EPS of $1.23, compared with $0.47 in fourth-quarter 2018. On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), fourth-quarter 2019 EPS, excluding special items, was $1.13, compared with adjusted EPS of $1.12 in fourth-quarter 2018. 

Fourth-quarter 2019 EPS included a net pre-tax loss from special items of about $2.4 billion, which consisted of an early debt extinguishment charge of $2.1 billion, an impairment charge of $236 million primarily related to the write-down of goodwill in the Media business, and a net charge related to severance and annual mark-to-market for pension and OPEB (other post-employment benefits) liabilities

of $135 million. The company also recorded a $2.2 billion tax benefit related to the sale of preferred shares in a foreign affiliate. The cash impact related to the tax benefit of this sale will be realized in 2020.

In fourth-quarter 2019, Verizon's results included the effects of a reduction in benefits from the adoption of a revenue recognition standard, primarily due to the deferral of commission expense, and the adoption of a lease accounting standard. The combined net impact was a 4 cent headwind in fourth-quarter 2019, and 17 cents for full-year 2019, which is included in the year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS.

For full-year 2019, Verizon reported $4.65 in EPS, compared with $3.76 in full-year 2018. On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), excluding special items, 2019 EPS was $4.81, compared with 2018 EPS of $4.71.

Consolidated results

Total consolidated operating revenues in fourth-quarter 2019 were $34.8 billion, up 1.4 percent from fourth-quarter 2018. This growth was primarily driven by higher wireless service revenue, highlighted by volumes and step-ups in access, partially offset by lower wireless equipment revenue and declines in revenue from wireline products and services, predominantly in the Business segment. Full-year 2019 consolidated operating revenues were $131.9 billion, up 0.8 percent year over year.

Cash flow from operations totaled $35.7 billion in 2019, an increase from $34.3 billion in 2018. This growth was the result of operational improvements in Verizon's businesses and lower discretionary employee benefit contributions, partially offset by higher cash tax payments and cash payments related to the Voluntary Separation Program. 

Full-year 2019 capital expenditures were $17.9 billion. Capital expenditures continue to support the launch and build-out of Verizon's 5G Ultra Wideband network, the growth in data and video traffic on the company's 4G LTE network, the deployment of significant fiber in markets nationwide and the upgrade to Verizon's Intelligent Edge Network architecture. 

The company's unsecured debt decreased by $3.9 billion in 2019. The company remains focused on reducing its net unsecured debt portfolio into its targeted range of 1.75 to 2.0 times, while continuing to actively manage its near-term maturities, optimize its overall funding footprint and lower its cost of capital. With leverage nearing the high end of the targeted range, the company is adding share repurchases as a

fourth priority to the capital allocation policy. Repurchases would begin after the company's other priorities have been met, including investment in the business, commitment to the dividend and strengthening of the balance sheet.  

In 2018, Verizon announced a goal to achieve $10 billion in cumulative cash savings by 2021. This initiative has yielded $5.7 billion of cumulative cash savings since the program began and is on track to achieve its target. For full-year 2019, Verizon realized approximately $1.3 billion in expense savings from the Voluntary Separation Program. 

Net income was $5.2 billion in fourth-quarter 2019. EBITDA (non-GAAP, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) totaled approximately $9.0 billion. Consolidated operating income margin was 19.1 percent in fourth-quarter 2019, compared with 1.9 percent in fourth-quarter 2018. Consolidated EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) was 25.8 percent in fourth-quarter 2019, compared with 20.2 percent in fourth-quarter 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) in fourth-quarter 2019 was 32.0 percent, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) in fourth-quarter 2019 was $11.1 billion.

percent year over year. Segment EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) was 39.9 percent in fourth-quarter 2019, down from 41.2 percent in fourth-quarter 2018. For the full year, segment EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) was 44.3 percent in 2019, compared with 44.5 percent in 2018. On a year over year basis, headwinds from the deferral of commission expense and the lease accounting standard accounted for approximately 80 basis points for the quarter.

Business results[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Media results

•Total Verizon Media revenues in fourth-quarter 2019 were $2.1 billion, nearly flat year over year. This is a meaningful improvement from the decline reported at the beginning of the year. Gains in native advertising and the demand-side platform continue to be offset by declines in legacy desktop search revenue streams. 

Outlook and guidance

For 2020, Verizon expects the following:

•Adjusted EPS growth (non-GAAP) of 2 to 4 percent. 

•Low-to-mid single-digit percentage growth in consolidated revenues compared to full-year 2019.

•Capital spending to be in the range of $17 billion to $18 billion, including the expansion of 5G in new and existing markets, the densification of 4G, and the continuation of the fiber build-out. 

•Adjusted effective income tax rate (non-GAAP) in the range of 23 percent to 25 percent.
