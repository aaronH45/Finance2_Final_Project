Item 8.01 Other Events

As previously announced, on February 28, 2019, Aflac Incorporated, a Georgia corporation (the Company), entered into a Shareholders Agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) with Japan Post Holdings Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation (Japan Post Holdings), J&A Alliance Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation, solely in its capacity as trustee (the Trustee) of J&A Alliance Trust, a New York voting trust (the Trust), and General Incorporated Association J&A Alliance, a Japanese general incorporated association. Pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders Agreement, the Trust will use commercially reasonable efforts to acquire, through open market or private block purchases in the United States, beneficial ownership of approximately 7% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the Company Common Stock) within a period of 12 months following the date J&A Alliance Trust first acquires any shares of Company Common Stock.

Under the terms of the Shareholders Agreement, the Trust’s acquisition of Company Common Stock is subject to (i) the expiration of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended, (ii) the Form A approvals of the Director of the Nebraska Department of Insurance and the Superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, (iii) the approval of or confirmation or nondisapproval by the Japan Fair Trade Commission, (iv) notice to the Japanese Financial Services Agency and (v) confirmation or nondisapproval by the Japanese Kanto Local Finance Bureau. The Shareholders Agreement requires the parties to use reasonable best efforts to obtain these regulatory approvals as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event by the one year anniversary of the date on which the Trust first acquires any shares of Company Common Stock. On May 7, 2019, a press release issued by Japan Post Holdings announced that purchases of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement commenced on April 29, 2019 through the Trust, and that such purchases were planned to be completed within its fiscal year 2019 (which ends March 31, 2020).

On December 31, 2019, the parties received Form A approval from the Director of the Nebraska Department of Insurance. Together with the regulatory approvals received previously, including Form A approval by the Superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services on December 13, 2019, all regulatory approvals set forth above have now been obtained.

The Shareholders Agreement requires the parties to use reasonable best efforts to cooperate in connection with any ongoing regulatory matters related to or arising from the Trust’s acquisition or ownership or control of the shares of Company Common Stock, including any applications or filings in connection with a direct or indirect acquisition of control of or merger with an insurer by the Company or its affiliates.

The foregoing description of the Shareholders Agreement is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Shareholders Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.50 to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed April 26, 2019, and the terms of which exhibit are incorporated herein by reference.
