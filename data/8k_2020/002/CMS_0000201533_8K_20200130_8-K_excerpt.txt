Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.  

On January 30, 2020, CMS Energy Corporation (“CMS Energy”) issued a News Release, in which it announced its 2019 results. Attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference is a copy of the CMS Energy News Release, furnished as a part of this report. 

Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined in Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Other than forward-looking earnings guidance, Exhibit 99.1 contains a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. CMS Energy provides forward-looking earnings guidance on an adjusted basis. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items. Because CMS Energy is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact reported earnings in future periods, Exhibit 99.1 does not contain reported earnings guidance nor a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company’s present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. The adjusted earnings should be considered supplemental information to assist in understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. All references to net income refer to net income available to common stockholders and references to earnings per share are on a diluted basis.  

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.  

The information set forth in the CMS Energy News Release dated January 30, 2020, attached as Exhibit 99.1, is incorporated by reference in response to this Item 7.01. 

CMS Energy will hold a webcast to discuss its 2019 results and provide a business and financial outlook on January 30 at 8:30 a.m. (EST). A copy of the CMS Energy presentation is furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to this report. A webcast of the presentation will be available on the CMS Energy website, www.cmsenergy.com. 

In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, shall not be deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933. 

Investors and others should note that CMS Energy routinely posts important information on its website and considers the Investor Relations section, www.cmsenergy.com/investor-relations, a channel of distribution.
