SAN DIEGO - February 6, 2020 -- Teradata Corp. (NYSE: TDC) reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 financial results driven by an ongoing transition to a recurring revenue model. Subscription-based transactions comprised 89 percent of the company’s bookings mix in the quarter. Recurring revenue increased 7 percent, both reported and in constant currency(1), from the fourth quarter of 2018. ARR increased 9 percent, both reported and in constant currency(1), from the prior-year period. As the company shifts to a recurring revenue model and focuses its consulting resources on strategic engagements that drive increased software consumption within its targeted customer base, perpetual revenue and consulting revenue declined versus the prior-year period, as expected. Fourth-quarter total revenue was $494 million, compared to 2018 fourth-quarter total revenue of $588 million. Currency translation had a one percentage point negative impact on the fourth-quarter total revenue comparison(1). 

For the full year, total revenue was $1.899 billion, compared to $2.164 billion reported in the prior year. Subscription-based transactions comprised 88 percent of the Company’s bookings mix for the full year. Recurring revenue of $1.362 billion increased 9 percent, 11 percent in constant currency(1) from the prior year. ARR at the end of 2019 was $1.427 billion, a 9 percent increase, both reported and in constant currency(1), from the end of 2018.

“Teradata continues to make solid progress on its business transformation. We closed out our 2019 transition year on a positive note, as we doubled our cloud customers, grew both recurring revenue and ARR, and effectively completed our transition to a subscription business,” said Vic Lund, Interim CEO, Teradata. “Teradata has strong differentiation in delivering the answers our customers need, at the scale they require, and we are resolutely focused on helping customers drive competitive advantage in this world of ever-growing data."

Teradata reported a net loss of $23 million under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the fourth quarter, or $0.21 per share, which compared to net income of $15 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP 2019 fourth-quarter net income, which excludes stock-based compensation 

expense and other special items, was $25 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, as compared to $58 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2018(2).  

For the full year, net loss reported under GAAP was $24 million, or $0.21 per share, which compared to net income of $30 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in 2018. Non-GAAP 2019 full-year net income, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and other special items, was $121 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, as compared to $156 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, in 2018(2).  

Gross Margin

2019 fourth-quarter gross margin reported under GAAP was 50.2 percent versus 49.1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and other special items, 2019 fourth-quarter gross margin was 53.2 percent versus 52.0 percent in the same period of the prior year(2). 

2019 full-year gross margin reported under GAAP was 50.3 percent versus 47.4 percent in 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and other special items, 2019 full-year gross margin was 53.3 percent versus 50.6 percent in 2018(2). The gross margin rate was higher year-over-year primarily due to a higher mix of recurring revenue.

Operating Loss/Income

2019 fourth-quarter operating loss reported under GAAP was $9 million compared to operating income of $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and other special items, 2019 fourth quarter operating income was $48 million versus $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2018(2). 

2019 full-year operating income reported under GAAP was $6 million compared to $43 million in 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and other special items, 2019 full-year operating income was $183 million versus $210 million in 2018(2). The decline in operating income was primarily driven by the higher subscription-based bookings mix which resulted in a significant decline in perpetual revenue, as well as a decline in consulting revenue, as expected and consistent with our strategy. 

Income Taxes

Teradata’s 2019 fourth-quarter tax rate under GAAP was negative 43.8 percent compared to 21.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding special items, Teradata’s non-GAAP 2019 fourth-quarter tax rate was 39.0 percent versus 17.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018(2). Teradata’s 2019 full-year tax rate under GAAP was negative 41.2 percent compared to negative 11.1 percent in 2018. Excluding special items, Teradata’s non-GAAP 2019 full-year tax rate was 24.4 percent versus 19.6 percent in 2018(2). The increase in the non-GAAP effective tax rate year-over-year was primarily due to earnings mix and an increase in the U.S. Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax period-over-period. 

Cash Flow

For the 2019 fourth quarter, Teradata generated $54 million of cash from operating activities compared to $107 million in the same period of 2018. During the quarter, Teradata used $13 million versus using $63 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, for capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software development costs. Teradata’s 2019 fourth-quarter free cash flow was $41 million, compared to $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2018(3). In addition, the company added $37 million of finance leases in the fourth quarter and $115 million for the full year 2019, primarily to support subscription sales. 

For the full year 2019, Teradata generated $148 million of cash from operating activities versus $364 million in 2018. During the year, Teradata used $59 million compared to using $160 million in 2018 for capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software development costs. This resulted in 2019 full-year free cash flow of $89 million compared to $204 million in 2018(3). 

Balance Sheet

Teradata ended 2019 with $494 million in cash. During the fourth quarter of 2019, Teradata repurchased 2.2 million shares of the Company’s common stock for approximately $61 million. For the full year, the Company repurchased 8.5 million shares for approximately $300 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, Teradata had approximately 111 million shares outstanding.

Supplemental Financial Information 

Additional information regarding Teradata’s operating results is provided below as well as on the Investor Relations page of Teradata’s website at investor.teradata.com.

1.The impact of currency is determined by calculating the prior-period results using the current-year monthly average currency rates (except for currency impact on ARR which is calculated using month-end rates). See the foreign currency fluctuation schedule on the Investor Relations page of the Company’s web site at investor.teradata.com, which is used to determine revenue on a constant currency (“CC”) basis.

* Annual recurring revenue is defined as the annual value at a point in time of all recurring contracts, including subscription, software upgrade rights, maintenance and managed services.

2.Teradata reports its results in accordance with GAAP. However, as described below, the Company believes that certain non-GAAP measures such as non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, or EPS, all of which exclude certain items (as well as free cash flow) are useful for investors. Our non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as substitutes for, or superior to, results determined in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The following tables reconcile Teradata’s actual and projected results and EPS under GAAP to the Company’s actual and projected non-GAAP results and EPS for the periods presented, which exclude certain specified items. Our management internally uses supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, such as gross profit, operating income, net income and EPS, excluding certain items, to understand, manage and evaluate our business and support operating decisions on a regular basis. The Company believes such non-GAAP financial measures (1) provide useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the 

Company’s ongoing operations, (2) are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations and results, that may be more easily compared to peer companies and allow investors a view of the Company’s operating results excluding stock-based compensation expense and special items, (3) provide useful information to management and investors regarding present and future business trends, and (4) provide consistency and comparability with past reports and projections of future results.

* The Company’s forecasted first quarter and full-year 2020 GAAP effective tax rates are expected to include $152 million of discrete tax benefit related to an intra-entity asset transfer of certain of its intellectual property to one of its Irish subsidiaries, which occurred on January 1, 2020. The tax benefit for this intra-entity asset transfer will be recorded as a deferred tax asset in the first quarter of 2020 and represents the book and tax basis difference on the transferred assets measured based on the applicable Irish statutory tax rate. The tax deductions for amortization of the IP asset will be recognized in the future, and any amortization not deducted for tax purposes will be carried forward indefinitely under Irish tax laws. The Company expects to be able to realize the deferred tax assets resulting from these intra-entity asset transfers.

** Represents the income tax effect of the pre-tax adjustments to reconcile GAAP to Non-GAAP income based on the applicable jurisdictional statutory tax rate of the underlying item. Including the income tax effect assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to the underlying business and performance of the Company’s ongoing operations. As a result of these adjustments, the Company’s non-GAAP effective tax rate was 39.0% for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2018.

*** Represents the impact to earnings per share as a result of moving from basic to diluted shares. 

3.As described below, the Company believes that free cash flow is a useful non-GAAP measure for investors. Teradata defines free cash flow as cash provided by / used in operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software. Free cash flow does not have a uniform definition under GAAP and therefore, Teradata’s definition may differ from other companies’ definitions of this measure. Teradata’s management uses free cash flow to assess the financial performance of the Company and believes it is useful for investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the Company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations. In particular, free cash flow indicates the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures for, among other things, investment in the Company’s existing businesses, strategic acquisitions, strengthening the Company’s balance sheet, repurchase of the Company’s stock and repayment of the Company’s debt obligations, if any. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since there may be other nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. This non-GAAP measure is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, results determined in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Teradata used $9 million of cash in the fourth quarter and $63 million of cash for the full year 2019, related to reorganizing and restructuring its operations and its go-to-market functions to align to its strategy.
