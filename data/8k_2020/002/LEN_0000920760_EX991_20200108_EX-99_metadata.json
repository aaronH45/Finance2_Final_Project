        "(1)Net Homebuilding debt to total capital is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net Homebuilding debt (Homebuilding debt less Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents) divided by total capital (net Homebuilding debt plus stockholders' equity). The Company believes the ratio of net Homebuilding debt to total capital is a relevant and a useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in Homebuilding operations. However, because net Homebuilding debt to total capital is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, this financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, this non-GAAP financial measure should be used to supplement the Company's GAAP results."
