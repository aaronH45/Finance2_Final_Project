NEWS RELEASE  

LOEWS CORPORATION REPORTS NET INCOME OF  

$932 MILLION FOR 2019  

NEW YORK, February 10, 2020—Loews Corporation (NYSE: L) today reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $932 million, or $3.07 per share, compared to $636 million, or $1.99 per share, in 2018. For the three months ended December 31, 2019, Loews reported net income of $217 million, or $0.73 per share, compared to a net loss of $165 million, or $0.53 per share, in the prior year period.  

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased due to higher earnings at CNA Financial Corporation and Boardwalk Pipelines, as well as higher parent company net investment income. These increases were partially offset by lower results at Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Loews Hotels & Co. Results for the three months ended December 31, 2019 improved mainly due to increased net investment income at CNA and the parent company, partially offset by lower results at Boardwalk Pipelines and Loews Hotels & Co. The loss during the three months ended December 31, 2018 was driven by catastrophe losses at CNA, investment results at both CNA and the parent company, and operating results at Diamond Offshore.  

Book value per share increased to $65.71 at December 31, 2019 from $59.34 at December 31, 2018. Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) increased to $65.94 at December 31, 2019 from $62.16 at December 31, 2018.

Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to 2018  

CNA’s earnings increased primarily due to higher net investment income and net investment gains and higher current year underwriting income driven mainly by lower catastrophe losses for the Property & Casualty (“P&C”) business. Earnings were partially offset by a higher net retroactive reinsurance charge recorded under the 2010 loss portfolio transfer with National Indemnity as compared with 2018. The P&C business generated gross written premium growth of 8% and net written premium growth of 6%.  

Diamond Offshore’s net loss improved primarily due to higher contract drilling revenues as a result of a contractual margin commitment from a customer, significantly offset by higher rig operating expenses including contract preparation and rig activation costs and increased depreciation expense.  

Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations benefited from higher firm transportation revenues from growth projects recently placed into service partially offset by the net impact of contract restructurings, expirations and renewals. Boardwalk Pipelines’ net income decreased as a result of a favorable tax adjustment recorded in 2018.  

Loews Hotels & Co’s results decreased due to impairment charges totaling $89 million ($69 million after tax) related to the carrying value of hotel properties. Excluding these charges, earnings benefited from improved results at the Orlando JV properties and certain owned hotels.  

Income generated by the parent company investment portfolio increased primarily due to higher returns on equity securities.  

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to 2018  

CNA’s earnings increased from higher net investment income driven by improved returns on limited partnership investments and from higher net investment gains. In addition, earnings in 2019 benefited from a lower net retroactive reinsurance charge recorded under the 2010 loss portfolio transfer with National Indemnity as compared with 2018 and a higher reduction of claim reserves resulting from the annual long term care claim experience study as compared with 2018. These increases were partially offset by a charge of $216 million ($151 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) resulting from the recognition of an active life reserve premium deficiency in long term care.  

Diamond Offshore’s results declined due to compressed contract drilling margins. Results in 2019 benefited from the absence of a $12 million rig impairment charge and an $8 million legal settlement charge (both after tax and noncontrolling interests) recorded in 2018.  

Boardwalk Pipelines’ earnings attributable to Loews improved primarily due to Loews owning 100% of the company as compared to 51% for a portion of 2018. Net income in 2019 also includes proceeds received in conjunction with a contract cancellation due to a customer bankruptcy that resulted in a $19 million (after tax) benefit and higher firm transportation revenues from growth projects recently placed into service, partially offset by the impact of contract restructurings and expirations.  

Loews Hotels & Co’s results decreased primarily due to impairment charges totaling $99 million ($77 million after tax) related to the carrying value of hotel properties. Excluding these impairment charges, earnings decreased due to higher pre-opening and other non-recurring expenses related to properties under development.  

Income generated by the parent company investment portfolio increased due primarily to higher returns on equity securities.
