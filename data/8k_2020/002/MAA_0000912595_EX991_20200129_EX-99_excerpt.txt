Same Store Portfolio Operating Results 

To ensure comparable reporting with prior periods, the Same Store Portfolio includes properties that were stabilized and owned by MAA at the beginning of the previous year. 

The Same Store Portfolio revenue growth of 4.1% during the fourth quarter of 2019 was primarily a result of a 4.3% increase in Average Effective Rent per Unit, as compared to the same period in the prior year.

Average Physical Occupancy for the Same Store Portfolio was 95.7% for the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease from the 96.1% in the same period in the prior year. Property operating expenses increased 2.5% for the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year, resulting in Same Store NOI growth of 5.0% for the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year. 

The Same Store Portfolio revenue growth of 3.4% during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of a 3.6% increase in Average Effective Rent per Unit, as compared to the prior year.

Development and Lease-up Activity 

During the fourth quarter of 2019, MAA completed construction on the Phase III expansion of Post Parkside at Wade, located in Raleigh, North Carolina, and the completed expansion moved into our lease-up portfolio. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, MAA had seven development communities under construction. Total development costs for the seven communities are projected to be $489.5 million, of which an estimated $345.6 million remained to be funded as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019.

During the fourth quarter of 2019, MAA had one apartment community, Post Centennial Park, located in Atlanta, Georgia, complete its initial lease-up and move into MAA's stabilized portfolio.

Physical occupancy for these lease-up projects averaged 83.6% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. 

Acquisition and Disposition Activity 

In November 2019, MAA acquired a new 271-unit multifamily apartment community, The Greene, located in Greenville, South Carolina. The high-end community is located in the West End corridor of the downtown submarket of Greenville.  

In October 2019, a consolidated real estate entity owned by MAA and a private real estate company acquired a 25 acre land parcel located in Orlando, Florida and began development work during the fourth quarter of 2019.  

During the fourth quarter of 2019, MAA exited the Little Rock, Arkansas market after closing on the disposition of its five multifamily properties totaling 1,368 apartment units. MAA received combined gross proceeds of $149.6 million and recognized combined net gains on the sale of real estate assets of $80.0 million from the sale of these apartment communities. 

During the fourth quarter of 2019, MAA also closed on the disposition of two land parcels totaling 78 acres located in the Gulf  

2 

Shores, Alabama market for combined net proceeds of $9.4 million, resulting in combined gains on the sale of non-depreciable real estate assets of $2.8 million.  

Redevelopment Activity 

MAA continued its redevelopment program at select apartment communities throughout the portfolio. During the fourth quarter of 2019, MAA redeveloped the interiors of 1,733 units at an average cost of $6,402 per unit, bringing the total units renovated during the year ended December 31, 2019 to 8,329 at an average cost of $5,876 per unit, achieving average rental rate increases of approximately 9.8% above non-renovated units.  

Capital Expenditures 

Recurring capital expenditures totaled $14.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, or approximately $0.12 per Share, as compared to $15.9 million, or $0.13 per Share, for the same period in the prior year. These expenditures led to Adjusted Funds from Operations, or AFFO, of $1.56 per Share for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $1.42 per Share for the same period in the prior year. 

Redevelopment, revenue enhancing, commercial and other capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2019 were $27.8 million, as compared to $31.8 million for the same period in the prior year. These expenditures led to Funds Available for Distribution, or FAD, of $156.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $135.3 million for the same period in the prior year. 

Recurring capital expenditures totaled $72.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or approximately $0.62 per Share, as compared to $72.0 million, or $0.61 per Share, for the prior year. These expenditures led to AFFO of $5.93 per Share for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $5.43 per Share for the prior year. 

Redevelopment, revenue enhancing, commercial and other capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2019 were $117.4 million, as compared to $125.6 million for the prior year. These expenditures led to FAD of $583.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $515.1 million for the prior year. 

A reconciliation of FFO, AFFO and FAD to net income available for MAA common shareholders, and an expanded discussion of the components of FFO, AFFO and FAD, can be found later in this release. 

Financing Activities 

In November 2019, MAA's operating partnership, Mid-America Apartments, L.P. (referred to as MAALP or the Operating Partnership), issued $300.0 million of 2.750% senior unsecured notes due in 2030. In connection with the bond transaction, MAALP cash-settled $150 million in forward interest rate swap agreements entered into during 2019 to effectively lock the interest rate on the planned bond issuance, which produced an effective interest rate of 3.065% over the term of the bonds.  

During the fourth quarter of 2019, MAALP retired $170.0 million of unsecured loans before maturity and a $17.2 million secured property mortgage at maturity. 

As of December 31, 2019, MAA had approximately $947.7 million of combined cash and available capacity under MAALP's unsecured revolving credit facility, net of commercial paper borrowings. 

Dividends and distributions paid on shares of common stock and noncontrolling interests during the fourth quarter of 2019 were $113.6 million, as compared to $108.8 million for the same period in the prior year. 

During the fourth quarter of 2019, MAA sold 146,301 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $19.9 million through its at-the-market share offering program.  

Balance Sheet 

As of December 31, 2019: 

•  

Total debt to adjusted total assets (as defined in the covenants for the bonds issued by MAALP) was 31.4%; 

•  

Total debt outstanding was $4.5 billion with an average effective interest rate of approximately 3.8%; 

•  

98.4% of total debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates for an average of approximately 7.6 years; and 

•  

Unencumbered NOI was 90.2% of total NOI, as compared to 92.6% as of December 31, 2018. 

104th Consecutive Quarterly Common Dividend Declared 

MAA declared its 104th consecutive quarterly common dividend, which will be paid on January 31, 2020 to holders of record on January 15, 2020. The current annual dividend rate is $4.00 per common share, an increase from the prior year’s annual rate of $3.84.

2020 Net Income per Diluted Common Share and Core FFO and Core AFFO per Share Guidance 

MAA is providing initial 2020 guidance for Net income per diluted common share, as well as Core FFO per Share, and Core AFFO per Share. FFO, Core FFO and Core AFFO are non-GAAP measures. Acquisition and disposition activity materially affects depreciation and capital gains or losses, which combined, generally represent the majority of the difference between Net income available for common shareholders and FFO. As discussed in the definitions of non-GAAP measures found later in this release, MAA's definition of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts', or NAREIT's, definition, and Core FFO represents FFO further adjusted for items that are not considered part of MAA’s core business operations. MAA believes that Core FFO is helpful in understanding operating performance in that Core FFO excludes not only depreciation expense of real estate assets and certain other non-routine items, but it also excludes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance. MAA intends to update Net income per diluted common share, Core FFO per Share and Core AFFO per Share guidance on a quarterly basis. 

Net income per diluted common share is expected to be in the range of $3.02 to $3.26 per diluted common share, or $3.14 per diluted common share at the midpoint, for the full year of 2020. Core FFO per Share for the year is expected to be in the range of $6.38 to $6.62 per Share, or $6.50 per Share at the midpoint. This initial guidance is based on projections of Same Store Portfolio property revenue growth of 3.25% to 4.25% for the full year based on continued strong occupancy, low resident turnover and steady leasing conditions, while Same Store Portfolio operating expense growth is expected to be in the range of 3.75% to 4.75% for the full year. A primary driver of the operating expense growth range is the expectation of continued increases in property real estate taxes. As a result, Same Store NOI growth for the full year is expected to be 3.00% to 4.00%. FFO guidance for 2020 includes an expected effective interest rate range of 3.9% to 4.1%. MAA expects Core FFO for the first quarter of 2020 to be in the range of $1.53 to $1.65 per Share, or $1.59 per Share at the midpoint. MAA does not forecast Net income per diluted share on a quarterly basis as MAA cannot accurately predict the timing of forecasted acquisition and disposition activity within a particular quarter (rather than during the course of the full year). 

MAA expects total recurring capital expenditures for the full year of 2020 to be approximately $79.0 million, which would produce expected Core AFFO per Share of $5.71 to $5.95 per Share, or $5.83 per Share at the midpoint, for the full year of 2020.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES   

Adjusted EBITDAre 

For purposes of calculations in this release, Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for real estate, or Adjusted EBITDAre, is composed of EBITDAre adjusted for net gain or loss on non-depreciable asset sales, insurance and other settlement proceeds and gain or loss on debt extinguishment. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers Adjusted EBITDAre to be an important measure of performance from core operations because Adjusted EBITDAre does not include various income and expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. MAA's computation of Adjusted EBITDAre may differ from the methodology utilized by other companies to calculate Adjusted EBITDAre. Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as an alternative to Net income as an indicator of operating performance. 

Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) 

AFFO is composed of FFO less recurring capital expenditures. In order to better align the classification of capital expenditures with business goals, certain capital expenditures related to commercial properties have been reclassified out of recurring capital expenditures and revenue enhancing capital expenditures for comparative purposes. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. As an owner and operator of real estate, MAA considers AFFO to be an important measure of performance from operations because AFFO measures the ability to control revenues, expenses and recurring capital expenditures. 

Core Adjusted Funds from Operations (Core AFFO) 

Core AFFO is composed of Core FFO less recurring capital expenditures. Core AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance.

Core Funds from Operations (Core FFO)

While MAA's definition of Core FFO may be similar to others in the industry, MAA's methodology for calculating Core FFO may differ from that utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Core FFO should not be considered as an alternative to Net income available for MAA common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. MAA believes that Core FFO is helpful in understanding our core operating performance between periods in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance.

FFO represents net income available for MAA common shareholders (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on disposition of operating properties and asset impairment, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and adjustments for joint ventures.

MAA believes that FFO is helpful in understanding operating performance in that FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets.

Average Physical Occupancy 

Average Physical Occupancy represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the respective period.

Non-Same Store Portfolio 

Non-Same Store Portfolio includes recent acquisitions, communities that have been identified for disposition, communities that have undergone a significant casualty loss, and stabilized communities that do not meet the requirements defined by the Same Store Portfolio.  

Same Store Portfolio 

MAA reviews its Same Store Portfolio at the beginning of each calendar year, or as significant transactions warrant. Communities are generally added into the Same Store Portfolio if they were owned and stabilized at the beginning of the previous year. Communities are considered stabilized after achieving at least 90% occupancy for 90 days. Communities that have been approved by MAA's Board of Directors for disposition are excluded from the Same Store Portfolio.
