Emerson Three-Month Orders, Including Foreign Currency Translation

(Percentage change versus prior year; trailing three-month averages, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, including currency translation)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

December 2019 Orders Comments

Total Emerson trailing three-month orders were up slightly with underlying orders up 1 percent, excluding a 1 percent unfavorable currency impact. 

Automation Solutions orders were up 1 percent and were up 2 percent on an underlying basis excluding unfavorable currency of 1 percent. December orders included several liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects that had been delayed from the second half of fiscal 2019, which is an encouraging early indication for greenfield (KOB1) business investment for LNG.

All world areas were positive, reflecting growth across most key end markets and the key LNG project bookings. Long-cycle businesses were up overall, with the Systems business underlying orders up over 10 percent and the Final Control business down 1 percent, as we wait for the KOB1 projects to be booked. We continued to see weakness across North American upstream oil and gas markets as well as global discrete end markets, where distribution channels continued to reduce inventories on hand. Additionally, global metals and mining investment softened due to trade uncertainties, weaker global economic growth, and strong prior year comparisons. 

As we have done in the past, below we have provided estimates for global underlying orders growth rates for key end markets.

(All data represents percentage change versus prior year; trailing three-month average at December 2019, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On a global basis and consistent with prior periods, maintenance and repair (KOB3) spending comprised approximately 55 percent of the orders mix. Brownfield projects, which are focused on expansion, modernization, and optimization of existing facilities (KOB2) comprised approximately 20 percent. Greenfield investments (KOB1) comprised approximately 25 percent of the orders mix.

Americas underlying orders were up 1 percent, including two LNG projects booked in December. North American upstream oil and gas investment, however, continued to be challenged by soft end markets and difficult prior year comparisons, and midstream pipelines and terminals capital spending declined. Chemical & petrochemical and refining end markets grew mid-single digits but were offset by weakness in Latin American metals and mining, which was strong in the prior year.

Europe underlying orders were up 1 percent reflecting strong investment activity in LNG and power markets and mid-single digit growth in chemical & petrochemical markets. These growth trends were offset by soft discrete markets, down high single digits, and lower investment activity in metals and mining. 

Asia, Middle East & Africa underlying orders were up 5 percent. Asia remained strong, with underlying orders up 10 percent, supported by our continued focus and investment in our KOB2 and KOB3 programs. China orders grew high single digits. Overall, upstream and chemical markets led the growth, up high single digits and low double digits, respectively. Of note, senior management recently visited the Middle East and India to conduct a series of market updates and customer reviews. In these areas, solid momentum continues across KOB1, KOB2, and KOB3 activity.

Commercial & Residential Solutions orders were down 1 percent with underlying orders also down 1 percent. 

North America HVAC markets continued to show softness and were down low single digits. Latin America grew mid-single digits. Underlying orders in Asia grew more than 10 percent, driven by commercial AC and heating strength, and aided by favorable prior year comparisons. China grew low single digits. European demand remained strong, up nearly 10 percent, led by residential heat pump activity. 

Global cold chain and professional tools markets showed continued softness as distribution channels reduced inventories.

In general, this platform is tracking as expected for better orders growth as fiscal 2020 progresses.
