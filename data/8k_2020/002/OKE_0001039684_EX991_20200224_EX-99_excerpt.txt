Reconciliations to relevant GAAP measures are included in this news release. “2019 was another successful year for ONEOK with volume growth driving strong results across our business segments,” said Terry K. Spencer, ONEOK president and chief executive officer. “With the completions of the Elk Creek Pipeline and the Demicks Lake I and II plants, we continue to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to expanding our existing infrastructure to help our producer customers reduce natural gas flaring in the Williston Basin. “As we look ahead, we expect these recently completed projects and our remaining announced projects to drive significant adjusted EBITDA growth of 25% in 2020, with an outlook of approximately 20% adjusted EBITDA growth in 2021. This growth program is providing needed pipeline, processing and fractionation services to our customers from the Williston and Permian basins and the Mid-Continent region to the Texas Gulf Coast, growing our fee-based earnings for years to come,” added Spencer. FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2019 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ONEOK’s net income increased 9% in the fourth quarter 2019 and 11% for the full year 2019, compared with the same periods in 2018. Higher 2019 results were driven primarily by natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas volume growth, higher average fee rates in the natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing segments and increased transportation services in the natural gas pipelines segment, compared with the full year 2018. -more-  

ONEOK Announces 11% Increase in 2019 Net Income; Announces 2020 Financial Guidance and 2021 Outlook Feb. 24, 2020 Page 3 Results were offset partially by lower earnings from optimization and marketing due to wider location price differentials in 2018 in the natural gas liquids segment, higher employee- related costs associated with the growth of ONEOK’s operations and higher third-party transportation and fractionation costs in the natural gas liquids segment. Higher depreciation expense due to completed growth projects, narrower product price differentials in the natural gas liquids segment and lower realized NGL and natural gas prices in the natural gas gathering and processing segment also impacted 2019 results. HIGHLIGHTS: • Expansion project announcements: ◦ A full expansion of the Elk Creek Pipeline to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) by adding 10 pump stations; ◦ A fully contracted 100,000 bpd additional expansion of the West Texas LPG pipeline in the Permian Basin; and ◦ An additional 200 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) expansion of the Demicks Lake natural gas processing facility and related infrastructure in the Williston Basin. • New facilities completed: ◦ The 200 MMcf/d Demicks Lake I natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin was completed in October 2019; ◦ The 200 MMcf/d Demicks Lake II natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin was completed in January 2020; ◦ The 240,000 bpd Elk Creek Pipeline from the Williston Basin to ONEOK’s existing Mid-Continent NGL facilities was completed in December 2019; and ◦ The MB-4 fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Texas, had 75,000 bpd of fractionation capacity completed in December 2019. The remaining 50,000 bpd of capacity is expected to be completed in the first quarter 2020. • Paying in February 2020 a quarterly dividend of 93.5 cents per share, or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis, an increase of 9% compared with the same quarter in 2019; • DCF in excess of dividends paid of $558.5 million for 2019; • Net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.8 times on an annualized run-rate basis and 4.9 times on a trailing 12-month basis as of Dec. 31, 2019; and • Having no borrowings outstanding under its $2.5 Billion Credit Agreement, $220 million of commercial paper outstanding and $21 million of cash and cash equivalents as of Dec. 31, 2019. -more-

 ONEOK Announces 11% Increase in 2019 Net Income; Announces 2020 Financial Guidance and 2021 Outlook Feb. 24, 2020 Page 5 Natural Gas Gathering and Processing • 11% increase in natural gas volumes processed expected to be driven primarily by the completion of ONEOK’s Demicks Lake I and II processing plants. • Average fee rate expected to range from 90 to 95 cents per Million British thermal units (MMBtu). • Earnings expected to be approximately 85% fee based. Natural Gas Pipelines • Transportation capacity contracted expected to be approximately 98%. • Earnings expected to be more than 95% fee based. Additional guidance information can be found in the tables and in supplemental materials found on ONEOK’s website, www.oneok.com. 2021 OUTLOOK: ONEOK expects an approximately 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA in 2021, compared with the 2020 guidance midpoint. The projects expected to be completed in 2020 and the first quarter 2021 provide a foundation for continued earnings growth in 2021. Primary contributors to 2021 earnings growth are expected to include volume growth in the Williston and Powder River basins, additional contracted volumes on ONEOK’s Elk Creek Pipeline, the completion of the Bakken NGL Pipeline extension in the fourth quarter 2020 and the Bear Creek natural gas processing plant expansion in Dunn County, North Dakota, in the first quarter 2021. Additionally, increased volumes on the West Texas LPG pipeline system in the Permian Basin from completed expansion projects, the completion of the MB-5 NGL fractionator and the Arbuckle II Pipeline extension and expansions will provide further connectivity with Gulf Coast markets and are expected to contribute to 2021 earnings growth. EXPANSION PROJECT ANNOUNCEMENTS: NGL PROJECTS: The Elk Creek Pipeline expansion to 400,000 bpd is expected to cost approximately $305 million, with incremental capacity becoming available in early 2021 ramping up to the full 400,000 bpd in the third quarter 2021. The expansion is supported by long-term dedicated NGL production from ONEOK and third-party natural gas processing plants in the Williston and Powder River basins. -more-  

 ONEOK Announces 11% Increase in 2019 Net Income; Announces 2020 Financial Guidance and 2021 Outlook Feb. 24, 2020 Page 6 The fully contracted 100,000 bpd West Texas LPG pipeline expansion is expected to cost approximately $310 million and be completed in the second quarter 2021. The expansion is supported by long-term dedicated NGL production from third-party natural gas processing plants in the Permian Basin. Both NGL expansion projects are expected to generate an adjusted EBITDA multiple of less than four times. DEMICKS LAKE EXPANSION PROJECT: An additional 200 MMcf/d expansion of the Demicks Lake natural gas processing facility in McKenzie County, North Dakota, will increase total capacity of the existing site to 600 MMcf/d. The third Demicks Lake project, and related infrastructure, are expected to cost a total of approximately $305 million and be completed in the third quarter 2021. This expansion is supported by acreage dedications with primarily fee-based contracts and is expected to generate an adjusted EBITDA multiple of approximately four to five times. 2019 BUSINESS-SEGMENT RESULTS: Key financial and operating statistics are listed in the tables. Natural Gas Liquids Segment The natural gas liquids segment’s fourth quarter and full-year 2019 adjusted EBITDA increased 8% and 2%, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2018. Higher volumes in the Rocky Mountain region, Permian Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas of the Mid-Continent region, and higher average fee rates primarily in the Permian Basin contributed to the increases. NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased 6% and 7%, respectively, during the fourth quarter and full year 2019, compared with 2018. The segment connected ONEOK’s Demicks Lake I natural gas processing plant to its system in the fourth quarter 2019, and one existing plant connection in the Williston Basin was expanded during the quarter.

LINK TO EARNINGS TABLES AND PRESENTATION: https://ir.oneok.com/financial-information/financial-reports/2020 NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURES: ONEOK has disclosed in this news release adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA), distributable cash flow and dividend coverage ratio, which are non-GAAP financial metrics, used to measure the company’s financial performance and are defined as follows: • Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, noncash impairment charges, income taxes, noncash compensation expense, allowance for equity funds used during construction (equity AFUDC), and other noncash items; • Distributable cash flow is defined as adjusted EBITDA, computed as described above, less interest expense, maintenance capital expenditures and equity earnings from investments, excluding noncash impairment charges, adjusted for cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates and certain other items; and • Dividend coverage ratio is defined as ONEOK’s distributable cash flow to ONEOK shareholders divided by the dividends paid in the period. These non-GAAP financial measures described above are useful to investors because they, and similar measures, are used by many companies in the industry as a measure of financial performance and are commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate our financial performance and to compare our financial performance with the performance of other companies within our industry. Adjusted EBITDA, ONEOK distributable cash flow and dividend coverage ratio should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, these calculations may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of net income to adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and coverage ratio are included in the tables. -more-  

 ONEOK Announces 11% Increase in 2019 Net Income; Announces 2020 Financial Guidance and 2021 Outlook Feb. 24, 2020 Page 11 ONEOK has also disclosed in this news release forward-looking estimates for a 2021 adjusted EBITDA outlook and projected adjusted EBITDA multiples expected to be generated by the announced capital-growth projects. Adjusted EBITDA multiples for the announced capital-growth projects reflect the expected adjusted EBITDA to be generated by the projects relative to the capital investment being made. A reconciliation of estimated adjusted EBITDA related to ONEOK’s 2021 outlook and announced capital-growth projects to GAAP net income is not provided because the GAAP net income is not available without unreasonable efforts.
