[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Adjusted operating earnings (non-GAAP) is defined as net earnings from continuing operations attributable to International Paper Company (GAAP) excluding special items and non-operating pension expense. Management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present consolidated operating results. For discussion of special items, net and non-operating pension expense, see the Consolidated Statement of Operations and related notes.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

Business segment operating profits are used by International Paper's management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Full-year and fourth quarter 2019 business segment net sales and operating profits compared with the full-year 2018, the third quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018 are as follows:

Business Segment Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Industrial Packaging operating profits in the fourth quarter of 2019 were $605 million compared with $535 million in the third quarter of 2019. In North America, earnings increased due to improved demand for export containerboard, lower planned maintenance outage expenses and lower input costs, primarily for wood. Earnings were negatively impacted by lower average sales prices for export containerboard and boxes. Earnings benefited from a favorable inventory valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2019. In Europe, earnings improved driven by seasonally higher volumes, primarily in Morocco, improved margins and continued performance improvements at the Madrid, Spain mill, slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, primarily in Turkey.

Global Cellulose Fibers operating profits in the fourth quarter of 2019 were $(45) million compared with $4 million in the third quarter of 2019. Fourth quarter results were impacted by lower prices across all regions on very challenging supply and demand conditions. 

Printing Papers operating profits in the fourth quarter of 2019 were $109 million compared with $162 million in the third quarter of 2019. In North America, earnings decreased due to lower average sale prices, an unfavorable geographic mix and 

increased operating costs partially offset by lower planned maintenance outage expenses and input costs, primarily for wood. Earnings were negatively impacted by an unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2019. In Brazil, earnings decreased slightly due to lower average sales prices in export markets and increased operating costs mostly offset by seasonally stronger domestic demand and lower input costs. In Europe and Russia, earnings decreased primarily due to higher planned maintenance outages in Europe and lower average sales margins in both regions.

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS 

Ilim joint venture equity earnings were $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $18 million in the third quarter of 2019. Operationally, earnings increased slightly as improved sales volumes were mostly offset by lower export sales prices for hardwood pulp, softwood pulp and containerboard to China and other export markets. The Company recognized a non-cash after-tax foreign exchange gain of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 ($0.02 per diluted share), compared with a loss of $4 million in the third quarter of 2019 ($0.01 per diluted share), primarily due to Ilim's U.S. dollar denominated net debt.

Graphic Packaging equity earnings on our then 21.6% ownership position were $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with $10 million in the third quarter of 2019. 

CORPORATE EXPENSES

Corporate expenses were $9 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with $21 million in the third quarter of 2019. 

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

The reported effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 66%, compared to a 2019 third quarter reported effective tax rate of 30%. The higher tax rate in the fourth quarter reflects tax expense related to a foreign deferred tax valuation allowance, that was partially offset by a tax benefit from internal investment restructuring, both of which are included as special items. This non-cash valuation allowance was recorded as a result of tax law changes in foreign jurisdictions impacting future utilization of deferred tax assets of $203 million.

Excluding special items and non-operating pension expense, the operational effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 26%, compared with 27% for the third quarter of 2019. The lower operational effective tax rate in the fourth quarter is primarily due to the U.S. taxation of foreign earnings and related tax adjustments to the U.S. Federal tax provision recorded in the third quarter.

EFFECTS OF SPECIAL ITEMS

Special items in the fourth quarter of 2019 amount to a net after-tax charge of $258 million ($0.65 per diluted share) compared with $80 million ($0.20 per diluted share) in the third quarter of 2019 and $32 million ($0.08 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2018. Special items in all periods include the following charges (gains):

INTERNATIONAL PAPER COMPANY

Reconciliation of Net Earnings (Loss) Attributable to International Paper Company to Adjusted Operating Earnings

Preliminary and Unaudited

(In millions, except per share amounts)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Notes:

The Company calculates Adjusted Operating Earnings (non-GAAP) by excluding the after-tax effect of non-operating pension expense, items considered by management to be unusual (special items) as reflected in the notes to the Consolidated Statement of Operations and discontinued operations from the earnings reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present consolidated operating results. International Paper believes that using this information, along with net earnings, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations by quarter. Net earnings attributable to International Paper is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

Since diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each period, twelve-month per share amounts may not equal the sum of respective quarters.

Reconciliation of Cash Provided by Operations to Free Cash Flow

Preliminary and Unaudited

(In millions)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is cash provided by operations. Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available, after reinvesting in the business, to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay dividends, repurchase stock, service debt and make investments for future growth. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. By adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the Company’s ongoing performance, free cash flow also enables investors to perform meaningful comparisons between past and present periods. 

The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company’s presentation of non-GAAP measures in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies, including companies in the same industry as International Paper.

Management believes certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, can facilitate a better understanding of the impact of various factors and trends on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Management also uses these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance.
