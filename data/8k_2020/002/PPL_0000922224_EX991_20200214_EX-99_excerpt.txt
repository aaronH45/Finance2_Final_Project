 PPL Corporation Reports 2019 Earnings 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Achieves 2019 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.45 per share, exceeding the forecast midpoint for the 10th year in a row.

•Announces 2020 earnings forecast range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, with a midpoint of $2.50.

•Raises carbon emissions reduction goal to 80% from 2010 levels by 2050; advances prior 70% reduction goal by 10 years to 2040.

ALLENTOWN, Pa. (Feb. 14, 2020) – PPL Corporation (NYSE: PPL) on Friday (2/14) announced 2019 reported earnings (GAAP) of $1.75 billion, or $2.37 per share, compared with $1.83 billion, or $2.58 per share, in 2018. 

The year-over-year decrease in reported earnings reflects special items related to unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency economic hedges.

Adjusting for special items, 2019 earnings from ongoing operations (non-GAAP) were $1.81 billion, or $2.45 per share, compared with 2018 ongoing earnings of $1.71 billion, or $2.40 per share. 

The company exceeded the midpoint of its ongoing earnings forecast for the 10th straight year.

"As PPL enters its centennial year, I am proud of the positive impact we continue to make for our shareowners, customers and the communities we serve," said William H. Spence, PPL's chairman and chief executive officer.

"In 2019, we provided electricity and natural gas safely and reliably to more than 10 million customers," said Spence. "We delivered on our earnings commitments and paid more than $1 billion in dividends to shareowners. We invested more than $3 billion to strengthen grid resilience and advance a cleaner energy future. At the same time, we continued to provide award-winning customer satisfaction in each of the regions we serve by leveraging technology to improve service for our customers."

Looking ahead, Spence said the company plans to build on this momentum and extend its track record of operational excellence. He said PPL is committed to its long-term strategy to deliver best-in-sector operational performance, invest responsibly in a sustainable energy future, provide a superior customer experience, maintain a strong financial foundation, and engage and develop its people.

In addition to announcing fourth-quarter and 2019 earnings, the company announced a 2020 earnings forecast range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, with a midpoint of $2.50 per share. PPL also updated its 2021 guidance range to $2.40 to $2.60 per share from the prior range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share, reflecting lower expected foreign currency exchange rate forecasts.

The company said it plans to invest about $14 billion across its U.S. and U.K. businesses over the next five years as it continues to make the grid smarter and more resilient and as it reshapes electricity networks to reliably and efficiently enable more distributed energy resources, including solar power and energy storage. 

PPL also announced it has set a more aggressive carbon reduction goal of at least 80% from 2010 levels by 2050 and has accelerated its previous 70% goal by 10 years to 2040. PPL expects to achieve the reductions through a variety of actions. These include replacing Kentucky coal-fired generation over time with a mix of renewables and natural gas while meeting obligations to provide least-cost and reliable service to customers. In addition, the actions include steps across PPL's U.S. and U.K. businesses to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions from vehicle fleets and substations.

Spence said the company believes its carbon reduction goals are both achievable and in the best interests of customers. He said the announced changes reflect the company's ongoing resource planning in Kentucky, including updated forecasts of energy costs. PPL's Kentucky subsidiary recently executed contracts to purchase up to 100 megawatts of solar energy. These contracts are pending regulatory approval.

On Friday (2/14), the company also demonstrated its continued commitment to dividend growth, announcing that it is increasing its common stock dividend to $0.4150 per share on a quarterly basis. The increased dividend will be payable April 1 to shareowners of record as of March 10, 2020. The increase, PPL's 18th in 19 years, raises the annualized dividend from $1.65 per share to $1.66 per share. PPL has paid a dividend in every quarter since 1946.

In addition to announcing its year-end earnings results, PPL reported fourth-quarter 2019 earnings of $364 million, or $0.48 per share, compared with reported earnings of $415 million, or $0.57 per share, in 2018. The decrease in reported earnings primarily reflects special items related to unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency economic hedges. Adjusting for special items, fourth-quarter 2019 earnings from ongoing operations were $431 million, or $0.57 per share, compared with $382 million, or $0.52 per share, in 2018.

2020 Earnings Forecast

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Earnings from ongoing operations is a non-GAAP measure that could differ from reported earnings due to special items that are, in management’s view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company’s ongoing operations. PPL management is not able to forecast whether any of these factors will occur or whether any amounts will be reported for future periods. Therefore, PPL is not able to provide an equivalent GAAP measure for earnings guidance.

Effects of Equity Dilution

During 2019, PPL settled the remaining 43.25 million shares of common stock under two forward sale agreements completed in May 2018. Full settlement of these forward sale agreements occurred in November 2019. The shares issued in November 2019 are expected to result in 2020 dilution of $0.11 per share when compared to 2019 earnings per share results. Details regarding the $0.11 of dilution are as follows:

Excluding the effects of dilution and special items related to 2019 unrealized foreign currency economic hedges, PPL projects higher segment earnings in 2020 compared with 2019.

Management utilizes “Earnings from Ongoing Operations” as a non-GAAP financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to reported earnings, or net income, an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management’s view of PPL’s earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. In addition, PPL’s management uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance.

Earnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. Income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the statutory tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. Special items may include items such as:

•Unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency economic hedges (as discussed below).

•Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business.

•Impairment charges.

•Significant workforce reduction and other restructuring effects.

•Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments.

•Other charges or credits that are, in management’s view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company’s ongoing operations.

Unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency economic hedges include the changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts used to hedge British-pound-sterling-denominated anticipated earnings. The changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately within GAAP earnings. Management believes that excluding these amounts from Earnings from Ongoing Operations until settlement of the contracts provides a better matching of the financial impacts of those contracts with the economic value of PPL’s underlying hedged earnings.

Statements contained in this news release, including statements with respect to future earnings, cash flows, dividends, financing and corporate strategy, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Although PPL Corporation believes that the expectations and assumptions reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the statements. The following are among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements: market demand for energy in our U.S. service territories; weather conditions affecting customer energy usage and operating costs; the effect of any business or industry restructuring; the profitability and liquidity of PPL Corporation and its subsidiaries; new accounting requirements or new interpretations or applications of existing requirements; operating performance of our facilities; the length of scheduled and unscheduled outages at our generating plants; environmental conditions and requirements and the related costs of compliance; system conditions and operating costs; development of new projects, markets and technologies; performance of new ventures; asset or business acquisitions and dispositions; any impact of severe weather on our business; receipt of necessary government permits, approvals, rate relief and regulatory cost recovery; capital market conditions and decisions regarding capital structure; the impact of state, federal or foreign investigations applicable to PPL Corporation and its subsidiaries; the outcome of litigation against PPL Corporation and its subsidiaries; stock price performance; the market prices of equity securities and the impact on pension income and resultant cash funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans; the securities and credit ratings of PPL Corporation and its subsidiaries; political, regulatory or economic conditions in states, regions or countries where PPL Corporation or its subsidiaries conduct business, including any potential effects of threatened or actual cyberattack, terrorism, or war or other hostilities; British pound sterling to U.S. dollar exchange rates; new state, federal or foreign legislation, including new tax legislation; and the commitments and liabilities of PPL Corporation and its subsidiaries. Any forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these important factors and in conjunction with factors and other matters discussed in PPL Corporation’s Form 10-K and other reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
