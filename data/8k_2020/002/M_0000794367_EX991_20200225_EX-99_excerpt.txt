*Comparable sales adjusted for the impact of the 53rd week reflect a shift of the company's 2017 calendar to align with 2018 on a like-for-like basis.

Note: Adjusted metrics reflect the exclusion of certain items from the respective financial measures. Please see the final pages of this news release for important information regarding the nature of such excluded amounts and calculation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures.

“Taken as a whole, 2019 did not play out as we intended for Macy's, Inc. However, we executed well during the Holiday 2019 season. We were pleased with the significant trend improvement in the fourth quarter, including a meaningful sales uptick in the 10 shopping days before Christmas. Together with disciplined expense management, our solid sales results in the fourth quarter allowed us to deliver stronger-than-expected earnings results. Importantly, we exited the year with a clean inventory position,” said Jeff Gennette, chairman and chief executive officer of Macy’s, Inc.

2019 Asset Sale Gains

Asset sale gains for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled $95 million pre-tax, or $71 million after-tax and $0.23 per diluted share attributable to Macy's, Inc. This compares to the fourth quarter of 2018, when asset sale gains totaled $278 million pre-tax, or $204 million after-tax and $0.65 per diluted share attributable to Macy's, Inc. 

Asset sale gains for fiscal 2019 totaled $162 million pre-tax, or $120 million after-tax and $0.38 per diluted share attributable to Macy's, Inc. This compares to fiscal 2018, when asset sale gains totaled $389 million pre-tax, or $287 million after-tax and $0.92 per diluted share attributable to Macy's, Inc.

Polaris Strategy

On February 4, 2020, Macy’s, Inc. announced its Polaris strategy, a three-year plan designed to stabilize profitability and position the company for sustainable, profitable growth. 

“We have a clear perspective of where Macy’s, Inc. and our brands - Macy’s, Bloomingdale's, and Bluemercury-- fit into American retail today. We know 2020 will be a transition year as we make significant structural changes to the business. I am confident that the Polaris strategy we shared earlier this month will allow us to stabilize margin in 2020 and position the company for healthy growth,” continued Gennette. 

The five major components of the Polaris strategy are:

•Strengthen Customer Relationships: Build customer lifetime value, expand Star Rewards loyalty program with the launch of Loyalty 3.0 in early February and accelerate personalization and monetization.

•Curate Quality Fashion: Drive disciplined merchandise category roles, be the best destination for the best brands and balance sales and margin.

•Accelerate Digital Growth: Enhance the digital experience across the Macy’s website and app, grow omni-channel customer base and improve profitability.

•Optimize the Store Portfolio: Continue the Growth treatment for stores in the best malls, expand off-mall profitably, and test and prove a retail ecosystem model with a mix of Macy’s store formats within a geographic market.

•Reset Cost Base: Right-size the organization and expense base, improve working capital and balance top-line and bottom-line growth.

The company is updating the estimated total costs related to Polaris to approximately $400 million to $420 million. In 2019, the company recognized Polaris-related costs of approximately $318 million, of which approximately $161 million were non-cash impairment charges associated with store closures and campus consolidations and $157 million were cash costs related to restructuring activities. The remaining costs to be recorded in 2020 are expected to be cash.

Important Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the company's financial information with additional useful information in evaluating operating performance. Management believes that providing supplemental changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis and changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis adjusted for the 53rd week calendar shift, which include adjusting for growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties, assists in evaluating the company's ability to generate sales growth, whether through owned businesses or departments licensed to third parties, and in evaluating the impact of changes in the manner in which certain departments are operated. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial measure which the company believes provides meaningful information about its operational efficiency by excluding the impact of changes in tax law and structure, debt levels and capital investment. In addition, management believes that excluding certain items from EBITDA, net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy's, Inc. shareholders that are not associated with the company’s core operations and that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude from period-to-period provides useful supplemental measures that assist in evaluating the company's ability to generate earnings and to more readily compare these metrics between past and future periods. 

The reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure of changes in comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis to GAAP comparable sales (i.e., on an owned basis) is in the same manner as illustrated below, except that the impact of growth in comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties is the only reconciling item. In addition, the company does not provide the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure of diluted earnings per share attributable to Macy’s, Inc. shareholders excluding certain items because the timing and amount of excluded items are unreasonably difficult to fully and accurately estimate. 

Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company's actual and future financial condition and performance. Additionally, the amounts received by the company on account of sales of departments licensed to third parties are limited to commissions received on such sales. The methods used by the company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.

Changes in Comparable Sales

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Notes:

(4)Represents the period-to-period percentage change in net sales from stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales, excluding commissions from departments licensed to third parties. Stores impacted by a natural disaster or undergoing significant expansion or shrinkage remain in the comparable sales calculation unless the store, or material portion of the store, is closed for a significant period of time. Definitions and calculations of comparable sales may differ among companies in the retail industry.

(5)Represents the impact of including the sales of departments licensed to third parties occurring in stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales in the calculation of comparable sales. The company licenses third parties to operate certain departments in its stores and online and receives commissions from these third parties based on a percentage of their net sales. In its financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP, the company includes these commissions (rather than sales of the departments licensed to third parties) in its net sales. The company does not, however, include any amounts in respect of licensed department sales (or any commissions earned on such sales) in its comparable sales in accordance with GAAP (i.e., on an owned basis). The amounts of commissions earned on sales of departments licensed to third parties are not material to its net sales for the periods presented.

(6)Represents comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis that incorporates a shift of the company's fiscal 2017 calendar to align with fiscal 2018 on a like-for-like basis as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017.
