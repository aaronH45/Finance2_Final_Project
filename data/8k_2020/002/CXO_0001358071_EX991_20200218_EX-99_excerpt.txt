Tim Leach, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “During the fourth quarter, we delivered strong operational and financial performance, with oil volumes exceeding our guidance range and cash flow from operations totaling $801 million, excluding working capital changes. This exceeded exploration and development costs of $614 million, resulting in free cash flow of $187 million for the quarter. Our cost structure continued to improve as well, with fourth quarter controllable costs coming in below our year-end 2020 target of $9.00 per Boe.

We carry this focus into 2020. Our strategic priorities are to grow margins, grow free cash flow, grow distributions and advance our sustainability progress. We are off to a strong start with a disciplined, returns-focused capital program that is expected to increase oil production 10% to 12% year over year on a pro forma basis for asset sales. The capital program also enables us to strengthen distributions to shareholders, with a 60% increase to our quarterly dividend. With improving capital efficiency and a strong foundation of high-margin drilling opportunities, Concho is well positioned to deliver strong returns for investors.”

Fourth-Quarter 2019 Summary

Fourth-quarter 2019 oil production volumes increased 8% year over year to 215 thousand barrels per day (MBopd). Natural gas production for fourth-quarter 2019 totaled 735 million cubic feet per day (MMcfpd). The Company’s total production for fourth-quarter 2019 grew 10% year over year to 337 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoepd). 

Net loss for fourth-quarter 2019 was $471 million, or $2.38 per share. Special items impacting earnings for the quarter included a $201 million goodwill impairment charge and a $133 million loss on the disposition of assets, primarily related to certain exchanges of oil and natural gas properties. Excluding these and other special items, fourth-quarter 2019 adjusted net income (non-GAAP) was $206 million, or $1.03 per share. Concho’s average realized price for oil and natural gas for fourth-quarter 2019, excluding the effect of commodity derivatives, was $56.63 per Bbl and $1.88 per Mcf, respectively. 

Achieved Controllable Cost Target Early 

The Company is focused on improving operating margins by reducing its cost structure and established a $9.00 per Boe controllable cost target by year-end 2020. Controllable costs include oil and natural gas production expenses (consisting of lease operating and workover expenses), cash general and administrative expenses (which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation) and interest expense. For fourth-quarter 2019, controllable costs totaled $8.43 per Boe, representing a 17% decrease year over year and achieving the Company's target one year early. 

Generated Strong Cash Flow

For fourth-quarter 2019, cash flow from operating activities was $769 million, including $32 million in working capital changes. Operating cash flow before working capital changes (non-GAAP) was $801 million, exceeding fourth quarter costs incurred for exploration and development activities of $614 million.

Completed New Mexico Shelf Asset Sale

On November 1, 2019, the Company completed the previously-announced sale of its New Mexico Shelf assets. The sale proceeds enabled Concho to achieve its debt reduction target, by paying down its credit facility, while delivering additional returns to shareholders under its $1.5 billion share repurchase program. During fourth-quarter 2019, the Company repurchased 3.3 million shares for $250 million at an average price of $75.75 per share. 

Full-Year 2019 Summary

Total production for 2019 increased 26% to 331 MBoepd, including a 25% increase in oil production to 209 MBopd. Natural gas production for 2019 was 731 MMcfpd. 

For 2019, Concho’s average realized price for oil and natural gas, excluding the effect of commodity derivatives, was $54.03 per Bbl and $1.74 per Mcf, respectively, compared with $56.22 per Bbl and $3.40 per Mcf, respectively, for 2018. 

Net loss for 2019 was $705 million, or $3.55 per share, compared with net income of $2.3 billion, or $13.25 per share, in 2018. Excluding non-cash and special items, full-year 2019 adjusted net income (non-GAAP) was $611 million, or $3.05 per share, compared with adjusted net income of $792 million, or $4.59 per share, for full-year 2018. 

Adjusted EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for 2019 totaled $3.1 billion, compared with $2.8 billion in 2018. 

For 2019, cash flow from operating activities was $2.8 billion, including $40 million in working capital changes. Operating cash flow before working capital changes (non-GAAP) was $2.9 billion. Costs incurred for exploration and development activities totaled $3.0 billion for the year.

2019 Proved Reserves 

At December 31, 2019, Concho’s estimated proved reserves totaled 1.0 billion Boe, compared to 1.2 billion Boe at year-end 2018. The Company’s proved reserves are approximately 62% oil and 38% natural gas. Proved developed reserves totaled 745 MMBoe, or 74% of total proved reserves, compared to 69% at year-end 2018. The reduction in proved reserves year over year is primarily attributable to the sale of the Company's New Mexico Shelf assets, performance revisions from the Company's well-spacing tests, the decline in oil and natural gas prices used to determine proved reserves and the removal of proved undeveloped reserves that the Company no longer expects to develop within the SEC mandated development window. For a summary of the Company’s estimated proved reserves, see Estimated Year-End Proved Reserves below. 

Outlook

For 2020, Concho is planning to invest $2.6 to $2.8 billion. The Company's activity is expected to result in 300 to 320 gross operated well completions with an average lateral length of 10,000 feet, as compared to 294 gross operated well completions with an average lateral length of approximately 9,000 feet in 2019. This activity reflects efficiency gains that the Company has realized, which enable the Company to complete approximately 10% more lateral feet year over year on approximately 90% of the capital. Oil production volumes are expected to increase 10% 

 3

to 12% year over year (pro forma for the sale of the New Mexico Shelf assets). First-quarter 2020 production is expected to be 316 to 325 MBoepd (202 to 208 MBopd).

60% Increase in Quarterly Dividend

Our high-quality asset base and strong operating margins provide sustainable free cash flow growth that supports increasing returns to shareholders. Consistent with Concho's strategic priorities to grow margins, free cash flow and distributions to shareholders, the Company's Board of Directors approved a 60% increase to the quarterly dividend, from $0.125 to $0.20 per share. The next quarterly dividend is payable on March 27, 2020, to stockholders of record as of February 28, 2020.

Earnings per Share

Unaudited

The Company uses the two-class method of calculating earnings per share because certain of the Company’s unvested share-based awards qualify as participating securities.

The Company’s basic earnings (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed as (i) net income (loss) as reported, (ii) less participating basic earnings (iii) divided by weighted average basic common shares outstanding. The Company’s diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders is computed as (i) basic earnings (loss) attributable to common stockholders, (ii) plus reallocation of participating earnings (iii) divided by weighted average diluted common shares outstanding.

The following table reconciles the Company’s earnings (loss) from operations and earnings (loss) attributable to common stockholders to the basic and diluted earnings (loss) used to determine the Company’s earnings per share amounts for the periods indicated under the two-class method:

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Unaudited

The Company reports its financial results in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, the Company believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results, the results of its peers and the results of prior periods. In addition, the Company believes these measures are used by analysts and others in the valuation, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. See the reconciliations throughout this release of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures for the periods indicated.

Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share

The Company’s presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the effect of certain items are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share represent earnings (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share determined under GAAP without regard to certain non-cash and special items. The Company believes these measures provide useful information to analysts and investors for analysis of its operating results on a recurring, comparable basis from period to period. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for earnings (loss) or diluted earnings (loss) per share as determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

The following table provides a reconciliation from the GAAP measure of net income (loss) to adjusted net income, both in total and on a per diluted share basis, for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 15

Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDAX

Adjusted EBITDAX (as defined below) is presented herein and reconciled from the GAAP measure of net income (loss) because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator. 

The Company defines adjusted EBITDAX as net income (loss), plus (1) exploration and abandonments, (2) depreciation, depletion and amortization, (3) accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations, (4) impairments of long-lived assets, (5) impairments of goodwill, (6) non-cash stock-based compensation, (7) (gain) loss on derivatives, (8) net cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives, (9) (gain) loss on disposition of assets and other, (10) interest expense, (11) gain on equity method investments, (12) RSP transaction costs and (13) income tax expense (benefit). Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of net income (loss) or cash flows as determined by GAAP. 

The Company’s adjusted EBITDAX measure provides additional information that may be used to better understand the Company’s operations. Adjusted EBITDAX is one of several metrics that the Company uses as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of its business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance. Certain items excluded from adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets. Adjusted EBITDAX, as used by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that adjusted EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by the Company’s management team and by other users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. For example, adjusted EBITDAX can be used to assess the Company’s operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure, and to assess the financial performance of the Company’s assets and the Company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the GAAP measure of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDAX for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 16

Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Operating Cash Flow Before Working Capital Changes and to Free Cash Flow

The Company provides Operating Cash Flow (OCF) before working capital changes, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. OCF before working capital changes represents net cash provided by operating activities as determined under GAAP without regard to changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and dispositions as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes OCF before working capital changes is an accepted measure of an oil and natural gas company’s ability to generate cash used to fund development and acquisition activities and service debt or pay dividends. Additionally, the Company provides free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital in excess of exploration and development costs incurred. The Company believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it provides measures to compare cash from operating activities and exploration and development costs across periods on a consistent basis.

These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities as indicators of operating performance.

The following tables provide a reconciliation from the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities to OCF before working capital changes and to free cash flow:
