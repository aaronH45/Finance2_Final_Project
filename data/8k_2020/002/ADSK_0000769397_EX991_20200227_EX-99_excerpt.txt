Business Outlook

The following are forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are set forth below under "Safe Harbor Statement." Autodesk's business outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2021 takes into consideration the current economic environment and foreign exchange currency rate environment. A reconciliation between the fiscal 2021 GAAP and non-GAAP estimates is provided below or in the tables following this press release. 

First Quarter Fiscal 2021

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________

(1) Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share excludes $0.43 related to stock-based compensation expense, $0.08 for the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, $0.01 for acquisition-related costs, partially offset by ($0.06) related to a GAAP-only tax benefit.

Full Year Fiscal 2021

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________

(1) Excluding the approximately $15 million impact of foreign currency exchange rates and hedge gains/losses, billings guidance would be $4,650 - $4,730 million and revenue guidance would be $3,945 - $4,005 million.

(2) Non-GAAP operating margin excludes approximately 9% related to stock-based compensation expense, approximately 2% for the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and less than 1% related to acquisition-related costs.

(3) Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share excludes $1.65 related to stock-based compensation expense, $0.29 for the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, $0.04 related to acquisition-related costs, partially offset by ($0.17) related to a GAAP-only tax benefit.

(4) Free cash flow is cash flow from operating activities less approximately $105 million of capital expenditures.

The first quarter and full year fiscal 2021 outlook assume a projected annual effective tax rate of 21 percent and 16 percent for GAAP and non-GAAP results, respectively. Shifts in geographic profitability continue to impact the annual effective tax rate due to significant differences in tax rates in various jurisdictions. Thus, assumptions for the annual effective tax rate are evaluated regularly and may change based on the projected geographic mix of earnings.

Key Performance Metrics

In order to help better understand our financial performance we use several key performance metrics including billings, recurring revenue, ARR, net revenue retention rate ("NR3"), ARPS, and subscriptions. These metrics are key performance metrics and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue. These metrics are not intended to be combined with those items. We use these metrics to monitor the strength of our recurring business. We believe these metrics are useful to investors because they can help in monitoring the long-term health of our business. Our determination and presentation of these metrics may differ from that of other companies. The presentation of these metrics is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Glossary of Terms

Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR): Represents the annualized value of total monthly recurring revenue for the preceding three months. "Maintenance plan ARR” captures ARR relating to traditional maintenance attached to perpetual licenses. "Subscription plan ARR" captures ARR relating to subscription offerings. Refer to the definition of recurring revenue below for more details on what is included within ARR. Recurring revenue acquired with the acquisition of a business is captured when total subscriptions are captured in our systems and may cause variability in the comparison of this calculation.  

Annualized Revenue Per Subscription (ARPS): Is calculated by dividing ARR by Total Subscriptions.

Billings: Total revenue plus the net change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period. 

6

Cloud Service Offerings: Represents individual term-based offerings deployed through web browser technologies or in a hybrid software and cloud configuration. Cloud service offerings that are bundled with other product offerings are not captured as a separate cloud service offering. 

Constant Currency (CC) Growth Rates: We attempt to represent the changes in the underlying business operations by eliminating fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as eliminating hedge gains or losses recorded within the current and comparative periods. We calculate constant currency growth rates by (i) applying the applicable prior period exchange rates to current period results and (ii) excluding any gains or losses from foreign currency hedge contracts that are reported in the current and comparative periods. 

Core Business: Represents the combination of maintenance, product subscription, and EBAs.  

Enterprise Business Agreements (EBAs): Represents programs providing enterprise customers with token-based access or a fixed maximum number of seats to a broad pool of Autodesk products over a defined contract term. 

Free Cash Flow: Cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures. 

Maintenance Plan: Our maintenance plans provide our customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts. Under our maintenance plans, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available, and technical support. We recognize maintenance revenue over the term of the agreements, generally one year.  

Net Revenue Retention Rate (NR3): Measures the year-over-year change in ARR for the population of customers that existed one year ago (“base customers”). Net revenue retention rate is calculated by dividing the current period ARR related to base customers by the total ARR from one year ago related to the same base customers. ARR is based on USD reported revenue, and fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and hedge gains or losses have not been eliminated. ARR related to acquired companies is excluded from the calculation for at least one year from integration. 

Other Revenue: Consists of revenue from consulting, training and other services, and is recognized over time as the services are performed. Other Revenue also includes software license revenue from the sale of products that do not incorporate substantial cloud services and is recognized up front.  

Product Subscription: Provides customers the most flexible, cost-effective way to access and manage 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software tools. Our product subscriptions currently represent a hybrid of desktop and cloud functionality, which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders.  

Recurring Revenue: Consists of the revenue for the period from our traditional maintenance plans and revenue from our subscription plan offerings. It excludes subscription revenue related to consumer product offerings, select Creative Finishing product offerings, education offerings, and third party products. Recurring revenue acquired with the acquisition of a business is captured when total subscriptions are captured in our systems and may cause variability in the comparison of this calculation.  

Remaining Performance Obligations: The sum of total short-term, long-term, and unbilled deferred revenue. Current remaining performance obligations is the amount of revenue we expect to recognize in the next twelve months.  

7

Spend: The sum of cost of revenue and operating expenses. 

Subscription Plan: Comprises our term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and EBAs. Subscriptions represent a combined hybrid offering of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. With subscription, customers can use our software anytime, anywhere, and get access to the latest updates to previous versions.  

Subscription Revenue: Includes subscription fees from product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and EBAs.  

Total Subscriptions: Consists of subscriptions from our maintenance plans and subscription plan offerings that are active and paid as of the fiscal year end date. For certain cloud service offerings and EBAs, subscriptions represent the monthly average activity reported within the last three months of the fiscal quarter end date. Total subscriptions do not include education offerings, consumer product offerings, select Creative Finishing product offerings, Autodesk Buzzsaw, Autodesk Constructware, and third party products. Subscriptions acquired with the acquisition of a business are captured once the data conforms to our subscription count methodology and when added, may cause variability in comparison of this calculation.

Unbilled Deferred Revenue: Unbilled deferred revenue represents contractually stated or committed orders under early renewal and multi-year billing plans for subscription, services and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not been recognized. Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 606, unbilled deferred revenue is not included as a receivable or deferred revenue on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
