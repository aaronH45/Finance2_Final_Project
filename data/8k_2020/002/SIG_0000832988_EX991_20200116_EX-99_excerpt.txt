Financial Guidance:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The above Fiscal 2020 guidance reflects the following assumptions:

•GAAP and non-GAAP operating profit and EPS guidance is inclusive of U.S List 4 tariff impact enacted in September 2019 which are not expected to be material to Fiscal 2020 results.

•Same store sales guidance includes an unfavorable impact of 25 bps related to a timing shift of service plan revenue recognized.

•Expected unfavorable $190 million impact on revenues due to store closings.

•Company plans to close approximately 165 stores in Fiscal 2020 and open 38 stores. This results in a higher net store reduction of 127 stores versus prior guidance of 115 net store reduction. Net selling square footage is now expected to decline approximately 2.7%.

•Credit outsourcing is expected to have a positive year-over-year impact on operating profit.

•Transformation program net savings goal increased to $80 million - $90 million versus prior guidance of $70 million - $80 million.

•Pre-tax charges of $70 million - $75 million related to the transformation plan.

•Interest expense of $37 million - $38 million versus prior guidance of $38 million - $40 million.

•Non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.61 - $3.69 excludes restructuring charges associated with the transformation plan, goodwill impairment charges and gain on early extinguishment of debt.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The above Q4 Fiscal 2020 guidance reflects the following assumptions: 

•GAAP and non-GAAP operating profit and EPS guidance is inclusive of U.S List 4 tariff impact enacted in September 2019 which are not expected to be material to fourth quarter Fiscal 2020 results.

•Expected unfavorable $55 million impact on revenues due to store closings.

•Pre-tax charges of $5 million - $10 million related to the transformation plan.

•Interest expense of $9 million - $10 million versus prior guidance of $10 million - $12 million.

•GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance is calculated using net income before preferred dividend and applying fully diluted share count.

•Non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.44 - $3.52 excludes restructuring charges associated with the transformation plan.

Possible litigation settlement assumptions:

•Guidance for Fiscal 2020 and Q4 Fiscal 2020 does not reflect the possible settlement of a previously disclosed litigation which, if it becomes probable, would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position. As part of settlement discussions, a mediator’s proposal which would include a company contribution was conditionally accepted by both parties, subject to a number of important contingencies, including approvals. There is no assurance that the proposed settlement will be consummated. If the possible settlement becomes probable, GAAP guidance would be impacted. There would be no impact on non-GAAP guidance.

Signet's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.37 per share for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, payable on February 28, 2020 to shareholders of record on January 31, 2020, with an ex-dividend date of January 30, 2020.
