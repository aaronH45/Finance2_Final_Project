In the event of a change in control triggering event, as defined in the Officer’s Certificate attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The descriptions of the Indenture, the Officer’s Certificate and the Notes in this report are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Indenture, the Officer’s Certificate and the Notes, respectively.
