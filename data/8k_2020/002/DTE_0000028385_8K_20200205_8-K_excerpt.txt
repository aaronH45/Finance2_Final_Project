DTE Energy Company (DTE Energy) is furnishing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with its earnings release issued February 5, 2020, announcing financial results for the year ended December 31, 2019. A copy of the earnings release and the slide presentation, including supplemental financial information, are furnished as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference. In its earnings release and the slide presentation discussed below, DTE Energy reaffirmed its 2020 operating earnings guidance range of $6.47 to $6.75. 

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

DTE Energy is furnishing the SEC with its slide presentation issued February 5, 2020. A copy of the slide presentation is furnished as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

In its earnings release, slide presentation and this filing, DTE Energy discusses 2020 operating earnings guidance. It is likely that certain items that impact the company's 2020 reported results will be excluded from operating results. Reconciliations to the comparable 2020 reported earnings guidance are not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items (i.e. future non-recurring items, certain mark-to-market adjustments and discontinued operations). These items may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on reported earnings. 

In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth in such a filing.
