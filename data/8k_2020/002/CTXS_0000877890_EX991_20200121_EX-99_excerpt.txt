  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

1Annualized Recurring Revenue, or ARR, is an operating metric that represents the contracted recurring value of all termed subscriptions normalized to a one-year period. It is calculated at the end of a reporting period by taking each contract’s recurring total contract value and dividing by the length of the contract. ARR includes only active contractually committed, fixed subscription fees. All contracts are annualized, including 30 day offerings where we take monthly recurring revenue multiplied by 12 to annualize. ARR should be viewed independently of U.S. GAAP revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace those items. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue.  

2A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this letter. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures.”  

   2019    Q4 and Full Year Financials   1      

     Subscription ARR accelerated year-over-year in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong growth in Workspace SaaS and Networking subscription. The notable inflection of subscription as a percentage of Networking product bookings was driven by a few large customers that elected to transition to pooled-capacity subscription agreements. One of these transactions was the largest Networking deal in Citrix’s history and drove subscription bookings as a percentage of total product bookings to 69% in the fourth quarter. These Networking subscription agreements contributed to the highest level of total subscription bookings mix we have achieved and reflects the confidence of our customers in our vision and in our ability to execute. Workspace drove Citrix Cloud paid subscribers to 7.1M, a 64% year-over-year increase. 

Citrix Workspace: Now Available With Greater Intelligence 

As the Citrix Workspace evolves as a platform, we are adding additional features and functionalities that tie together the myriad of applications that reside within enterprises. In doing so, we are creating the platform for digital transformation and developing a universal platform for work. Citrix Workspace enables a Zero Trust architecture, supporting the increasing importance of Workspace security to defend against an ever growing number of threats. Innovations within Citrix Workspace drive productivity in the workplace beyond our market-leading virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI). 

Importantly, in the fourth quarter, intelligence features within Citrix Workspace became generally available. This feature set is arguably the most significant functionality added to the Workspace in Citrix’s history. Now, consumer-like user interfaces can be experienced across every device on which Citrix Workspace runs, with single sign-on to access all enterprise applications and data. Universal search, contextual security and performance further differentiate Citrix Workspace and add unique value to our customers. 

Citrix Workspace with intelligence enables customers to unify and simplify employee experience by organizing, guiding and automating work anywhere, allowing employees more time to spend on value creating activities. Customers can now modernize their applications with minimal effort with our connector appliance that enables tools for on-premise application integrations, allowing customers to leverage existing investments and innovate more rapidly by focusing on what matters most. And, with our low-code builder for microapps, customers can accelerate their IT agility and innovation which enables faster delivery of business outcomes. 

With pre-built integrations with networking and SD-WAN, our Networking capabilities enable end-to-end Workspace delivery. By providing visibility of the user across the network and applications, we can provide comprehensive performance analytics and insights to customers.

Customer Highlight: Expanding from Virtual Applications to Workspace Platform 

Avon Cosmetics, recently acquired by Natura &Co, has been a direct selling pioneer and is now the fourth largest beauty, household and personal care products company in the world. As part of its digital transformation to update its infrastructure to support business objectives, including growing its global customer base, improving recruiting and retention of representatives, and ultimately accelerating revenue growth and margin expansion, Avon expanded its relationships with Citrix from Virtual Apps to utilize Citrix’s Workspace platform. 

Customer Highlight: Citrix Cloud Services and Google Cloud Platform support one of the world’s most sustainable businesses 

More than a conventional oil refining company, Neste is the world’s largest producer of renewable diesel with a goal of creating a healthier planet for the next generation. By moving to Citrix Cloud Services delivered on the scalable Google Cloud Platform, Neste needs far fewer servers and end users can log into Citrix services anywhere in the world, easily and securely. It enables all workers – employees, sub-contractors and affiliates to have a unified work experience wherever they are, reducing the need to commute. 

Citrix’s Transformation  

In addition to our transition from delivering products to platforms, we have been transforming our business from perpetual to subscription and from on-premise to cloud.  

Executing three simultaneous but interrelated transformations has required a heightened level of coordination and alignment across the organization. Looking back, we made great progress in 2019 that positions us well to continue to accelerate the pace of our transformation as we enter 2020.  

Progress in our business model transformation is evidenced by:  

   ·   Subscription bookings as a percent of total product bookings increased to 62% in 2019, up from 42% in 2018  

   ·   Subscription ARR of $743 million accelerated, up 41% year-over-year, with SaaS ARR of $520 million accounting for 70% of total subscription ARR  

   ·   Subscription revenue grew 43% year-over-year in 2019  

Looking ahead to 2020 and beyond, I am enthusiastic about our opportunity to create the Workspace category and position Citrix to become the preferred way in which people work globally, across all industries. The opportunity for Citrix is large and growing – and our product position has never been better. With Citrix Workspace with intelligence, we have an opportunity to both continue to grow our historical VDI business – and meaningfully grow broadly across an employee base, beyond our traditional knowledge worker end users.  

We are entering 2020 in a position of strength and look forward to executing to achieve our near and longer-term growth potential.

Financial Overview  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our transition to a subscription model focuses on growing higher value recurring revenue streams that result in more of the business booked in the current period being recognized in future periods. This subscription model transition creates variability in the individual components of future committed revenue (short-term, long-term and unbilled) due to the mix within subscription. In addition, we expect that average contract duration will increase, as more of our customers transition to the subscription model, which today typically has a 3-year duration and is a reflection of deepening and extending relationships with our customers.

Annualized Recurring Revenue 

· Subscription ARR in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $743 million, up 41% year-over-year 

· SaaS ARR in the fourth quarter was $520 million, up 49% year-over-year 

We believe ARR is a key performance indicator of the health and trajectory of our business, representing the pace of our transition and serves as a leading indicator of top line trends.

GAAP operating margin in the fourth quarter was 23%, and for the fiscal year was 18%  

 ·    

Non-GAAP operating margin in the fourth quarter was 34%, and for the fiscal year was 30%  

Earnings2

On January 21, 2020, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion, bringing the total remaining authorization to approximately $1.75 billion. We also announced today that we entered into a $1 billion term loan credit facility, which we plan to use to return capital through open market transactions, accelerated share repurchases, or other means, and is reflected in our guidance  

Guidance  

Full Year 2020  

Our full year 2020 guidance is now:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Guidance reflects our expectation that subscription bookings as a percentage of product bookings will increase from 62% in 2019 to approximately 65% to 75% in 2020. The magnitude of the impact to recognized revenue is dependent on the mix of product bookings as well as the mix within subscription bookings. If our actual subscription bookings as a percentage of product bookings or if our SaaS bookings mix within subscription bookings exceeds expectations, the headwind to our 2020 revenue could be higher.  

Guidance assumes that non-GAAP operating margin will decline approximately 100 basis points year-over-year driven by a higher mix of cloud subscriptions and investments to continue to scale a growing cloud mix. We expect 2020 to be the trough year for operating margin in our multi-year subscription transition.  

First Quarter 2020  

We currently anticipate:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Guidance reflects our expectation that subscription bookings as a percentage of product bookings will be in the range of 55% to 60% in the first quarter of 2020.  

The above statements are based on current targets as of the date of this letter. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures (Unaudited)  

Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this letter and related conference call or webcast to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude amortization and impairment primarily related to acquired intangible assets and debt discount, stock-based compensation expenses and charges associated with the Company’s restructuring programs, the related tax effect of those items, and charges and benefits related to tax reform. The Company also reflects the effect of anti-dilutive convertible note hedges in the number of shares used in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. The income tax effect on non-GAAP items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment. The Company’s basis for these adjustments is described below.  

Management uses these non-GAAP measures for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing its business outlook, to evaluate the Company’s performance and to evaluate and compensate the Company’s executives. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for comparison across accounting periods not influenced by certain non-cash items or cash charges that are the result of discrete activities that are not used by management when evaluating the Company’s historical and prospective financial performance. In addition, the Company has historically provided this or similar information and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company’s operating margins, operating expenses and net income and comparing the Company’s financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors. Management typically excludes the amounts described above when evaluating the Company’s operating performance and believes that the resulting non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing the Company’s operating performance due to the following factors:  

   ·    

The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. The Company, therefore, believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impact of amortization and impairment of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions, provide investors and financial analysts with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and, therefore, are useful to investors and financial analysts in helping them to better understand the Company’s operating results and underlying operational trends.  

   ·    

Amortization and impairment of intangible assets and the related tax effects are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  

   2019    Q4 and Full Year Financials   14         

   ·    

Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of the Company’s employees and executives, stock-based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time of grant, then amortized over a period of several years after the grant of the stock-based instrument, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the grant.  

   ·    

Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion are required to be accounted for as separate liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management’s assessment of the Company’s operating performance because management believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company’s operating results and underlying operational trends.  

   ·    

The Company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years that have resulted in costs associated with reductions in headcount, consolidation of leased facilities and related costs. Each restructuring activity has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. While the Company’s operations previously benefited from the employees and facilities covered by the various restructuring charges, these employees and facilities have benefited different parts of the Company’s business in different ways, and the amount of these charges has varied significantly from period to period. The Company, therefore, believes that the exclusion of these charges will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company’s operating results and underlying operational trends.  

   ·    

The Company had convertible note hedges in place to offset potential dilution from the embedded conversion feature in its convertible notes. For GAAP diluted earnings per share purposes, the Company cannot reflect the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedges. The Company believes that reflecting the anti-dilutive impact of the convertible note hedges in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share provides investors with useful information in evaluating the financial performance of the Company on a per share basis.  

   ·    

Tax charges or benefits resulting from the enactment of Swiss tax reform. These charges or benefits are not anticipated to be ongoing; and, thus, are outside of the normal operations of the Company’s business. Therefore, the Company believes that the exclusion of these charges or benefits will better help investors and financial analysts understand the Company’s operating results and underlying operational trends.  

These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. The additional non-GAAP financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP (such as net income and earnings per share) and should not be considered measures of the Company’s liquidity.
