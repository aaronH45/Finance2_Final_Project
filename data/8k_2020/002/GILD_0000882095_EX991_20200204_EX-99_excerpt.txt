Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to the same period in 2018:

•R&D expenses decreased primarily due to lower up-front collaboration and licensing expenses, partially offset by higher personnel costs to support Gilead’s cell therapy business and increased investment in Gilead’s research projects. Gilead recorded impairment charges of $800 million in 2019 for the IPR&D intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of Kite primarily related to the treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma and $820 million in 2018 related to the KITE-585 program (an anti-B cell maturation antigen being evaluated for the treatment of multiple myeloma).

•Non-GAAP R&D expenses increased primarily due to higher personnel costs to support Gilead’s cell therapy business and increased investment in Gilead’s research projects.

•SG&A expenses and non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased primarily due to higher promotional expenses in the United States and expenses associated with the expansion of Gilead’s business in Japan.

For the full year 2019, compared to the same period in 2018:

•R&D expenses increased primarily due to up-front collaboration and licensing expenses of $3.92 billion related to Gilead’s global research and development collaboration agreement with Galapagos, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense associated with Gilead’s acquisition of Kite. Furthermore, R&D expenses and non-GAAP R&D expenses increased primarily due to higher personnel costs to support Gilead’s cell therapy business.

•SG&A expenses increased primarily due to promotional expenses in the United States and expenses associated with the expansion of Gilead’s business in Japan and China, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense associated with Gilead’s acquisition of Kite.

•Non-GAAP SG&A increased primarily due to promotional expenses in the United States and expenses associated with the expansion of Gilead’s business in Japan and China.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Debt Securities

As of December 31, 2019, Gilead had $25.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities compared to $31.5 billion as of December 31, 2018.

Full Year 2020 Guidance 

Gilead provides its full year 2020 guidance below. Starting in 2020, Gilead will no longer regularly exclude stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP financial information. For comparability purposes, full year 2019 non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $10.4 billion and $6.13, respectively, had stock-based compensation expense not been excluded.

Forward-looking Statements

Statements included in this press release that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Gilead cautions readers that forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include: Gilead’s ability to achieve its anticipated full year 2020 financial results; Gilead’s ability to accelerate or sustain revenues for its antiviral and other programs; Gilead’s ability to realize the potential benefits of collaborations or licensing arrangements, including those with The Rockefeller University, Kyverna Therapeutics, Inc., Eisai Co., Ltd., Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. and Glympse Bio, Inc.; Gilead’s ability to initiate clinical trials in its currently anticipated timeframes; the risk that safety and efficacy data from clinical studies may not warrant further development of Gilead’s product candidates, including Yescarta in combination with mavrilimumab, 3BNC117, 10-1074, GS-6207 and product candidates evaluated for bridging fibrosis and compensated cirrhosis due to NASH; Gilead’s ability to submit new drug applications for new product candidates in the timelines currently anticipated; Gilead’s ability to receive regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all, for new and current products, including FDA and MHLW approvals for filgotinib for the treatment of RA and FDA and European Commission approvals of KTE-X19 for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma; Gilead’s ability to successfully commercialize its products, including expansion in China; the risk that private and public payers may be reluctant to provide, or continue to provide, coverage or reimbursement for new products; a larger than anticipated shift in payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments; market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic versions of Gilead products; the risk that physicians and patients may not see advantages of these products over other therapies and may therefore be reluctant to prescribe the products; and other risks identified from time to time in Gilead’s reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). In addition, Gilead makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Gilead bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There may be other factors of which Gilead is not currently aware that may affect matters discussed in the forward-looking statements and may also cause actual results to differ significantly from these estimates. Further, results for the quarter and the year ended December 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of operating results for any future periods. Gilead directs readers to its press releases, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 and other subsequent disclosure documents filed with the SEC.
