NRG Energy, Inc. Reports Full Year Results and Reaffirms Guidance

•Completed $250 million share repurchase authorization, announced on the Q2 2019 call; $1.6 billion completed since January 1, 2019

•Achieved 2019 Transformation Plan cost savings target of $590 million and working capital target of $370 million, and delivered margin enhancement of $135 million

•Initiated and paid increased quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, representing $1.20 on an annualized basis

PRINCETON, NJ - February 27, 2020 - NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NRG) today reported full year 2019 income from continuing operations of $4.1 billion, or $16.81 per diluted common share. This increase in income from continuing operations is driven by the release of a $3.5 billion tax valuation allowance due to continuing evidence of historical and forecasted positive earnings. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2019 was $2.0 billion, cash from continuing operations was $1.4 billion and FCFbG was $1.2 billion. Cash from continuing operations and FCFbG were impacted by certain cash receipts previously expected in 2019, which are now expected to be received in 2020.

“Our integrated platform delivered another year of stable financial and operational results,” said Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG President and Chief Executive Officer. “The strength of our business model provides the financial flexibility to continue perfecting our platform while consistently returning significant capital to our shareholders.”

Retail 

Full year 2019 Adjusted EBITDA was $920 million, $32 million lower than 2018, driven by higher supply costs, capacity obligations and weather, partially offset by margin enhancement initiatives and growth related to M&A activity.

Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $258 million, $61 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2018, driven by margin enhancement initiatives and the acquisition of Stream Energy. 

Generation

Full year 2019 Adjusted EBITDA was $1,069 million, $205 million higher than 2018, driven by:

•Texas: $364 million increase due to higher realized power prices, partially offset by higher operating expenses driven by forced outage at WA Parish and Gregory return-to-service costs; and

•East/West1: $159 million decrease primarily due to $178 million decrease in EBITDA from 2018 asset sales and the deconsolidation of projects, partially offset by lower operating expenses.

Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $130 million, $46 million higher than the fourth quarter 2018, driven by:

•Texas: $34 million increase due to higher realized power prices, partially offset by higher operating expenses; and

•East/West1: $12 million increase due to higher realized power prices and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower capacity revenues and deactivation of the Encina generation facility.

Appendix Table A-8: 2020 FCFbG Guidance Reconciliation

The following table summarizes the calculation of Free Cash Flow before Growth providing reconciliation to Cash from Operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that NRG’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

EBITDA represents net income before interest (including loss on debt extinguishment), taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is presented because NRG considers it an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes debt-holders frequently use EBITDA to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

•EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments;

•EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;

•EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments;

•Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and

•Other companies in this industry may calculate EBITDA differently than NRG does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to use to invest in the growth of NRG’s business. NRG compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. See the statements of cash flow included in the financial statements that are a part of this news release.

Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a further supplemental measure of operating performance. As NRG defines it, Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding impairment losses, gains or losses on sales, dispositions or retirements of assets, any mark-to-market gains or losses from accounting for derivatives, adjustments to exclude the Adjusted EBITDA related to the non-controlling interest, gains or losses on the repurchase, modification or extinguishment of debt, the impact of restructuring and any extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items plus adjustments to reflect the Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated investments. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons NRG considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. As an analytical tool, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to all of the limitations applicable to EBITDA. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted 

24

EBITDA, the reader should be aware that in the future NRG may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this news release.

Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of NRG's financial statements in evaluating its operating performance because it provides an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods and adjusts for items that we do not consider indicative of NRG’s future operating performance. This measure is widely used by debt-holders to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity and by equity investors to measure our operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations, and for evaluating actual results against such expectations, and in communications with NRG's Board of Directors, shareholders, creditors, analysts and investors concerning its financial performance.

Adjusted cash flow from operating activities is a non-GAAP measure NRG provides to show cash from operations with the reclassification of net payments of derivative contracts acquired in business combinations from financing to operating cash flow, as well as the add back of merger, integration and related restructuring costs. The Company provides the reader with this alternative view of operating cash flow because the cash settlement of these derivative contracts materially impact operating revenues and cost of sales, while GAAP requires NRG to treat them as if there was a financing activity associated with the contracts as of the acquisition dates. The Company adds back merger, integration related restructuring costs as they are one time and unique in nature and do not reflect ongoing cash from operations and they are fully disclosed to investors.

Free cash flow (before Growth) is adjusted cash flow from operations less maintenance and environmental capital expenditures, net of funding, preferred stock dividends and distributions to non-controlling interests and is used by NRG predominantly as a forecasting tool to estimate cash available for debt reduction and other capital allocation alternatives. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons NRG considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. Because we have mandatory debt service requirements (and other non-discretionary expenditures) investors should not rely on Free Cash Flow before Growth as a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures.

Free Cash Flow before Growth is utilized by Management in making decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Free Cash Flow before Growth is presented because the Company believes it is a useful tool for assessing the financial performance in the current period. In addition, NRG’s peers evaluate cash available for allocation in a similar manner and accordingly, it is a meaningful indicator for investors to benchmark NRG's performance against its peers. Free Cash Flow before Growth is a performance measure and is not intended to represent net income (loss), cash from operations (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure), or liquidity and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
