On a guidance basis, full-year 2019 earnings were $1.79 per diluted share, excluding certain impacts associated with the Vectren merger (the merger) and non-cash impairment charges recorded at Energy Services and Midstream Investments. Full-year 2019 earnings, on a guidance basis, included $0.12 of favorable weather and one-time tax benefits. Full-year 2018 earnings, on a guidance basis and excluding certain impacts associated with the merger, were $1.60 per diluted share. 

Fourth quarter 2019 earnings were $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $0.18 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018. On a guidance basis and excluding certain impacts associated with the merger and non-cash impairment charges, fourth quarter 2019 earnings were $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $0.36 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018.

“I am very pleased with our 2019 results, driven by strong utility performance, primarily as a result of customer growth and disciplined cost management, as well as favorable weather and tax related outcomes,” said John W. Somerhalder II, interim president and chief executive officer of CenterPoint Energy. “The recently announced agreements to sell our Energy Services and Infrastructure Services businesses will further sharpen the company’s focus on our core utility businesses, improving our business profile and earnings quality, while at the same time strengthening our balance sheet and enhancing our investment grade credit quality.”

Business Segments

Houston Electric - Transmission & Distribution

The Houston electric - transmission & distribution segment reported operating income of $624 million for the full-year 2019, consisting of $590 million from the regulated electric transmission and distribution utility operations (TDU) and $34 million related to securitization bonds. Operating income for the TDU for 2019 includes $10 million of merger-related expenses. Excluding merger-related expenses, 2019 TDU operating income was $600 million.

Operating income for 2018 was $623 million, consisting of $568 million from the TDU and $55 million related to securitization bonds. Excluding merger-related expenses, operating income for the TDU benefited primarily from rate relief, lower operation and maintenance expenses, customer growth and miscellaneous revenues, primarily 

--more--

related to right-of-way revenues. These benefits were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense, lower usage, lower revenues related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and lower equity return, primarily related to the annual true-up of transition charges.

Indiana Electric – Integrated

The Indiana electric – integrated segment reported operating income of $90 million for the full-year 2019. Operating income includes $21 million of merger-related expenses. These results are not comparable to 2018 as this segment was acquired in the merger in February 2019.

Natural Gas Distribution

The natural gas distribution segment reported operating income of $408 million for the full-year 2019. Operating income includes $55 million of merger-related expenses. Excluding merger-related expenses, 2019 natural gas distribution segment operating income was $463 million. Natural gas distribution segment operating income for the full-year 2018 was $266 million.

Excluding merger-related expenses, operating income increased $136 million due to the gas utilities acquired in the merger in February 2019. The remaining increase is primarily due to favorable weather and usage, driven by timing of a decoupling mechanism in Minnesota, rate relief, customer growth and lower operation and maintenance expenses. These increases were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense.

Energy Services

The energy services segment reported operating income of $32 million for the full-year 2019, which included a mark-to-market gain of $39 million and a non-cash impairment charge of $48 million recorded for goodwill, compared with an operating loss of $47 million for 2018, which included a mark-to-market loss of $110 million. Excluding mark-to-market adjustments and the non-cash impairment charge, operating income was $41 million for the full-year 2019 compared to $63 million for 2018. Operating income, excluding mark-to-market adjustments and the non-cash impairment charge, decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in margin due to fewer opportunities to optimize natural gas supply costs in 2019 relative to 2018.

Infrastructure Services

The infrastructure services segment reported operating income of $95 million for the full-year 2019. Operating income includes $32 million of merger-related expenses. These results are not comparable to 2018 as this segment was acquired in the merger in February 2019.

Midstream Investments

The midstream investments segment reported $229 million of equity income for the full-year 2019, which included the company's share, $46 million, of the non-cash impairment charge Enable Midstream Partners, LP (Enable) recorded for goodwill. Equity income for 2018 was $307 million. For further detail, please refer to Enable's investor materials provided during its 4th quarter earnings call on February 19, 2020.

Corporate and Other

The corporate and other segment reported an operating loss of $23 million for the full-year 2019, compared with an $11 million operating loss for 2018. Operating income in 2019 included $79 million of merger-related expenses. Operating income for 2018 included $46 million of merger-related expenses.

Earnings Outlook

2

To provide greater transparency on utility earnings, 2020 guidance will be presented in two components, a guidance basis Utility EPS range and a Midstream Investments EPS expected range.

•2020 guidance basis Utility EPS range of $1.10 - $1.20

•2020 - 2024 target of 5 - 7% compound annual guidance basis Utility EPS growth, using the 2020 range of $1.10 - $1.20 as the starting EPS

•2020 Midstream Investments EPS expected range is $0.23 - $0.28

Utility EPS Guidance Range

•Utility EPS guidance range includes net income from Houston Electric, Indiana Electric and Natural Gas Distribution business segments, as well as after tax operating income from the Corporate and Other business segment. 

•The 2020 Utility EPS guidance range considers operations performance to date and assumptions for certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as customer growth (approximately 2% for electric operations and 1% for natural gas distribution) and usage including normal weather, throughput, recovery of capital invested through rate cases and other rate filings, effective tax rates, financing activities and related interest rates, regulatory and judicial proceedings and anticipated cost savings as a result of the merger. The Utility EPS guidance range also assumes an allocation of corporate overhead based upon its relative earnings contribution. Corporate overhead consists of interest expense, preferred stock dividend requirements and other items directly attributable to the parent along with the associated income taxes. 

•Utility EPS guidance excludes:

◦Certain integration and transaction-related fees and expenses associated with the merger

◦Severance costs

◦Midstream Investments and allocation of associated corporate overhead

◦Results related to Infrastructure Services and Energy Services prior to the anticipated closing of the sale of those businesses, including anticipated costs and impairment resulting from the sale of Infrastructure Services and Energy Services

◦Earnings or losses from the change in value of ZENS and related securities

◦Changes in accounting standards

In providing this 2020 guidance, CenterPoint Energy uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share that does not consider the items noted above and other potential impacts, including unusual items, which could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the applicable guidance period. CenterPoint Energy is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward looking adjusted diluted earnings per share because changes in the value of ZENS and related securities is not estimable as it is highly variable and difficult to predict due to various factors outside of management’s control.

Midstream Investments EPS Expected Range

The 2020 Midstream Investments EPS expected range is $0.23 - $0.28. In providing this EPS range for Midstream Investments, the company assumes a 53.7 percent limited partner ownership interest in Enable and includes the amortization of its basis differential in Enable and assumes an allocation of CenterPoint Energy corporate overhead based upon Midstream Investments relative earnings contribution. The Midstream Investments EPS expected range takes into account such factors as Enable’s most recent public outlook for 2020 dated Feb. 19, 2020, and effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts such as any changes in accounting standards, impairments or Enable’s unusual items.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures by CenterPoint Energy in Providing Guidance

In addition to presenting its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), including presentation of income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share, CenterPoint Energy also provides guidance based on adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

To provide greater transparency on utility earnings, CenterPoint Energy’s 2020 guidance will be presented in two components, a guidance basis Utility EPS range and a Midstream Investments EPS expected range. The 2020 Utility EPS guidance range includes net income from Houston Electric, Indiana Electric and Natural Gas Distribution business segments, as well as after tax operating income from the Corporate and Other business segment. The 2020 Utility EPS guidance range considers operations performance to date and assumptions for certain significant variables that may impact earnings, such as customer growth (approximately 2% for electric operations and 1% for natural gas distribution) and usage including normal weather, throughput, recovery of capital invested through rate cases and other rate filings, effective tax rates, financing activities and related interest rates, regulatory and judicial proceedings and anticipated cost savings as a result of the merger. The 2020 Utility EPS guidance range also assumes an allocation of corporate overhead based upon its relative earnings contribution. Corporate overhead consists of interest expense, preferred stock dividend requirements and other items directly attributable to the parent along with the associated income taxes. Utility EPS guidance excludes (a) certain integration and transaction-related fees and expenses associated with the merger, (b) severance costs, (c) Midstream Investments and associated allocation of corporate overhead, (d) results related to Infrastructure Services and Energy Services prior to the anticipated closing of the sale of those businesses, including anticipated costs and impairment resulting from the sale of Infrastructure Services and Energy Services, and (e) earnings or losses from the change in value of ZENS and related securities. In providing this guidance, CenterPoint Energy uses a non-GAAP measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share that does not consider other potential impacts, such as changes in accounting standards or unusual items, which could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the applicable guidance period. CenterPoint Energy is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward looking adjusted diluted earnings per share because changes in the value of ZENS and related securities is not estimable as it is highly variable and difficult to predict due to various factors outside of management’s control.

The 2020 Midstream Investments EPS expected range assumes a 53.7 percent limited partner ownership interest in Enable and includes the amortization of the Company’s basis differential in Enable and assumes an allocation of CenterPoint Energy corporate overhead based upon Midstream Investments relative earnings contribution. The Midstream Investments EPS expected range takes into account such factors as Enable’s most recent public outlook for 2020 dated Feb. 19, 2020, and effective tax rates. The company does not include other potential impacts such as any changes in accounting standards, impairments or Enable’s unusual items.

Management evaluates the company’s financial performance in part based on adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of CenterPoint Energy’s overall financial performance by providing them with an additional meaningful and relevant comparison of current and anticipated future results across periods. The adjustments made in these non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that Management believes does not most accurately reflect the company’s fundamental business performance. These excluded items are reflected in the reconciliation tables of this news release, where applicable. CenterPoint Energy’s adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share, which respectively are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures also may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
