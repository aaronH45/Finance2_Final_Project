 Item 1.01  

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.   

On January 14, 2020, Autodesk, Inc. (“Autodesk” or the “Company”) issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.850% Notes due 2030 (the “Notes”). The Notes are governed pursuant to an indenture (the “Base Indenture”) and a fourth supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture” and referred to together with the Base Indenture as the “Indenture”) the Company entered into with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. Interest on the Notes accrues annually at a rate of 2.850% and is payable in each case semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing July 15, 2020.  

Autodesk may be required to offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change in control and contemporaneous downgrades of the Notes below investment grade ratings, and it may also elect to redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time, on the prices and on the terms further specified in the Indenture.  

The Indenture contains limited affirmative and negative covenants of Autodesk. The negative covenants restrict the ability of Autodesk and certain of its subsidiaries to incur liens on principal property (as defined in the Indenture); to engage in sale and lease-back transactions with respect to any principal property; and the ability of Autodesk to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets.  

Events of default under the Indenture include a failure to make payments, non-performance of affirmative and negative covenants, and the occurrence of bankruptcy and insolvency-related events. Autodesk’s obligations may be accelerated upon an event of default, in which case the entire principal amount of the Notes would become immediately due and payable.  

The foregoing description of certain terms of the Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Base Indenture, which was filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 13, 2012, and the Supplemental Indenture and related form of the Notes which are filed with this report as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively.
