On January 10, 2020, the Human Capital Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Unum Group appointed Michael Q. Simonds as Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer of Unum Group (the “Company”), effective February 1, 2020. In the new role, Mr. Simonds, 46, who since July 2013 has served as an Executive Vice President of the Company and President and Chief Executive Officer of its Unum US business unit, will be responsible for optimizing business operations across the enterprise.

Prior to heading the Company’s Unum US operations, Mr. Simonds served as Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Unum US from June 2012 to June 2013. Before that, he served as Senior Vice President, Growth Operations, Unum US from July 2010 to May 2012 and as Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Unum US from March 2008 to July 2010. Mr. Simonds originally joined a Unum Group predecessor company in 1994, left the Company in 2000 to pursue his MBA, and rejoined the Company in 2003 after working at McKinsey & Company, a global management consulting firm.

In connection with the appointment, the Committee also approved the terms of a new compensation package for Mr. Simonds. Effective February 1, 2020, his base salary will increase to $700,000 and his annual and long-term incentive targets will be set at 130% and 250% of base salary, respectively, for annual targeted total compensation of $3,360,000. For the 2020 performance year, Mr. Simonds’ incentive compensation (payable in 2021) will be prorated based on the time he spends in each position during the year.

As previously disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, the Company employs Charlene Glidden, who currently serves as Vice President, Customer Operations for Colonial Life and is a sister-in-law of Mr. Simonds. In 2019, she received compensation of approximately $450,121 and participated in compensation and benefit arrangements generally applicable to similarly situated employees. Beginning February 1, 2020, she will be included in Mr. Simonds’ organization and will have an indirect reporting relationship to him, but he will not be involved in decisions concerning her compensation.
