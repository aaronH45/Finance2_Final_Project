Item 7.01.  Regulation FD Disclosure. 

As previously disclosed, on April 5, 2019, CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (the “Company” or “CenterPoint Energy”) and CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (“Houston Electric”) announced that Houston Electric filed its base rate application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas (“PUCT”) and the cities in its service area to change its rates. On December 20, 2019, Houston Electric informed the PUCT that Houston Electric had reached an agreement in principle (the “Agreement”) with certain parties to Houston Electric’s pending rate case. On January 21, 2020, the Company and Houston Electric announced the key terms of the Agreement and that all parties to the case either support the Agreement or are unopposed to it. Houston Electric will file the final settlement documentation with the PUCT once finalized and executed by the parties, and the settlement will be subject to PUCT approval. A summary of the key terms of the Agreement, among other things, are as follows:

•Overall revenue requirement increase of approximately $13 million;

•Return on equity of 9.4%; 

•Capital structure of 57.5% debt / 42.5% equity;

•A refund of certain excess deferred income taxes (“EDIT”) of $105 million plus carrying costs over approximately 30-36 months; and

•Recovery of all transmission-related costs through Houston Electric’s transmission cost recovery factor.

Although the Company is currently assessing the overall financial impact of the Agreement to Houston Electric, the Company anticipates the following 2020 annualized impacts to Houston Electric:

Further, no write offs of rate base are expected to be required. The Agreement does require certain rate case expenses estimated at approximately $12 million to be written off in 2019. Also, Houston Electric would not be required to make a one-time refund of capital recovery from its transmission cost of service (“TCOS”) and distribution cost recovery factor (“DCRF”) mechanisms. Future TCOS filings would take into account both accumulated deferred federal income taxes and EDIT until the final order from Houston Electric’s next base rate proceeding.

Under the terms of the Agreement, Houston Electric would agree to adopt certain ring-fencing measures including provisions related to its credit agreement, maintaining a standalone credit rating, prohibitions on transferring material assets or facilities to affiliates, commingling assets or lending or borrowing money, subject to certain exceptions, among other provisions. However, with respect to any dividend restrictions, the PUCT would determine the application of any such restrictions. The dividend restrictions at issue include the following: (1) a limit on the payment of dividends by Houston Electric to an amount not to exceed its net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), (2) the suspension of dividends to the Company if Houston Electric’s credit rating at any one of the three major rating agencies falls below an established threshold for its senior secured debt and (3) a restriction on the payment of dividends by Houston Electric, except for contractual tax payments, where such dividends would cause Houston Electric to be out of compliance with the PUCT-approved debt-to-equity ratio.

Additionally, Houston Electric would not file a DCRF in 2020, nor would a subsequent separate proceeding with the PUCT be instituted regarding EDIT on Houston Electric’s securitized assets. A base rate application would be required to be filed for Houston Electric no later than four years from the date of the PUCT’s final order. The Company currently anticipates a final order from the PUCT regarding the Agreement during mid-first quarter 2020. 

The Company expects to post future filings associated with Houston Electric’s base rate application to the Regulatory Information subsection of the Investors section of the Company’s website. Based on guidance from the SEC, the Company may use the Investors section of its website (www.centerpointenergy.com) to communicate with investors. It is possible that the financial and other information posted there could be deemed to be material information.
