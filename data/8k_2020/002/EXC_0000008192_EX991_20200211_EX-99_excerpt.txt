EXELON REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2019 RESULTS

AND INITIATES 2020 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Exelon introduces 2020 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings guidance range of $3.00-$3.30 per share, reflecting growth in Utilities, offset by lower realized energy and capacity revenues

•Exelon Utilities project capital expenditures of $26 billion over the next four years to benefit its customers, supporting 7.3% annual rate base growth

•All four utilities ended the year with their best performance ever on customer satisfaction

•ComEd had its best performance ever in SAIFI and CAIDI, performing in the top decile for both

•Generation’s nuclear fleet capacity factor of 95.7% was the company's highest ever (owned and operated units)

CHICAGO (Feb. 11, 2020) — Exelon Corporation (Nasdaq: EXC) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019.

“Each of our utilities achieved record-high customer satisfaction in 2019 as we continued to invest in infrastructure to increase reliability and prepare the grid to accommodate more renewable energy, electric vehicles and other technology necessary to meet the challenge of climate change,” said Christopher M. Crane, president and CEO of Exelon. “Our nuclear fleet achieved its highest capacity factor in company history, and our total generation output accounted for about 12 percent of all the carbon-free energy produced in the U.S., avoiding nearly 81 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. We continued to support the communities we serve last year by volunteering a record-breaking 251,000 hours and donating nearly $52 million to nonprofits.”

“We reported another strong year, with full-year adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings of $3.22 per share coming in above our revised guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share,” said Joseph Nigro, senior executive vice president and CFO, Exelon. “Last year we invested $5.5 billion in capital at the utilities - or about $150 million more than originally planned - to modernize the electric grid, and we are on track to invest an additional $6.5 billion in the year ahead as we work to provide our customers with more reliable service and help our states meet their environmental goals. With these investments and our continuing focus on reducing costs, we are providing 2020 adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings guidance of $3.00 to $3.30 per share.”

Fourth Quarter 2019

Exelon's GAAP Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased to $0.79 per share from $0.16 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings increased to $0.83 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019 from $0.58 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the reconciliations of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings, refer to the tables beginning on page 6.

Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2019 primarily reflect:

•Higher utility earnings due to regulatory rate increases at PECO, BGE and PHI; and 

•Higher Generation earnings due to higher realized energy prices, decreased nuclear outage days, lower operating and maintenance expense and research and development income tax benefits, partially offset by lower capacity prices.

Full Year 2019

Exelon's GAAP Net Income increased to $3.01 per share from $2.07 per share in 2018. Exelon's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for 2019 increased to $3.22 per share from $3.12 per share in 2018.

Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the full year 2019 primarily reflect:

•Higher utility earnings due to regulatory rate increases at PECO, BGE and PHI and higher electric distribution, transmission and energy efficiency earnings at ComEd; partially offset by, 

•Lower Generation earnings due to lower realized energy and capacity prices, partially offset by lower operating and maintenance expense, decreased nuclear outage days and research and development income tax benefits.

Operating Company Results1 

ComEd

ComEd's fourth quarter of 2019 GAAP Net Income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings remained relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of 2018. Due to revenue decoupling, ComEd's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.

PECO

PECO’s fourth quarter of 2019 GAAP Net Income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings remained relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of 2018. The favorable impacts of regulatory rate increases were offset by unfavorable weather conditions and volume and higher storm costs.

BGE

BGE’s fourth quarter of 2019 GAAP Net Income increased to $99 million from $71 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. BGE’s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased to $101 million from $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to regulatory rate increases. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.

____________________

1Exelon’s five business units include ComEd, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois; PECO, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in southeastern Pennsylvania; BGE, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in central Maryland; PHI, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in the District of Columbia and portions of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey and retail natural gas distribution operations in northern Delaware; and Generation, which consists of owned and contracted electric generating facilities and wholesale and retail customer supply of electric and natural gas products and services, including renewable energy products and risk management services.

PHI

PHI’s fourth quarter of 2019 GAAP Net Income and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings remained relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of 2018. The favorable impacts of regulatory rate increases were offset by an increase in various expenses. Due to revenue decoupling, PHI's distribution earnings related to Pepco Maryland, DPL Maryland and Pepco District of Columbia are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.

Generation

Generation had GAAP Net Income of $397 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with a GAAP Net Loss of $178 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Generation’s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased to $427 million from $221 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting higher realized energy prices, decreased nuclear outage days, lower operating and maintenance expense and research and development income tax benefits, partially offset by lower capacity prices.

The proportion of expected generation hedged for the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York and ERCOT reportable segments as of Dec. 31, 2019, was 91.0% to 94.0% for 2020 and 61.0% to 64.0% for 2021.

Initiates Annual Guidance for 2020

Exelon introduced a guidance range for 2020 Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings of $3.00-$3.30 per share. The outlook for 2020 Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for Exelon and its subsidiaries excludes the following items:

•Mark-to-market adjustments from economic hedging activities;

•Unrealized gains and losses from NDT funds to the extent not offset by contractual accounting as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements; 

•Certain costs related to plant retirements;

•Certain costs incurred to achieve cost management program savings;

•Other items not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business; and

•Generation's noncontrolling interest related to exclusion items

Recent Developments and Fourth Quarter Highlights

•ComEd Distribution Formula Rate: On Dec. 4, 2019, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued an order approving ComEd’s 2019 annual distribution formula rate update. The final order resulted in a $17 million decrease to the revenue requirement, reflecting a $51 million increase for the initial revenue requirement for 2019 and a $68 million decrease related to the annual reconciliation for 2018. The decrease was set using an allowed return on rate base of 6.51% for the initial revenue requirement and the annual reconciliation, inclusive of an allowed ROE of 8.91%. The rates were effective on Jan. 1, 2020.

•PECO Transmission Formula Rate: On Dec. 5, 2019, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued an order approving a settlement agreement related to PECO’s May 2017 request to implement a formula rate. The settlement agreement provided for an increase of $14 million with a return on base of 7.62% compared with PECO's initial formula rate filing and allows for an ROE of 10.35%, inclusive of a 50 basis point adder for being a member of a Regional Transmission Organization.

•BGE Maryland Natural Gas and Electric Distribution Base Rate Case: On Dec. 17, 2019, the Maryland Public Service Commission (MDPSC) issued an order approving a settlement under which BGE’s annual electric and natural gas distribution revenues were increased by $18 million and $45 million, respectively. The rates were effective on Dec. 17, 2019. Under the settlement, the ROEs for purposes of calculating the Allowance for Funds Used During Construction and all authorized surcharges and regulatory asset carrying costs shall be 9.70% for electric and 9.75% for gas.

•DPL Maryland Electric Distribution Rate Case: On Dec. 5, 2019, DPL filed an application with the MDPSC to increase its annual electric distribution rates by $19 million, reflecting a requested ROE of 10.3%. DPL currently expects a decision in the third quarter of 2020 but cannot predict if the MDPSC will approve the application as filed.

•FERC Order on the PJM MOPR: On Dec. 19, 2019, FERC issued an order directing PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) to extend the Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR) to include new and existing resources, including nuclear, that receive state subsidies, effective as of PJM’s next capacity auction. Unless Illinois and New Jersey can implement a Fixed Resource Requirement (FRR) program in their PJM zones, the MOPR will apply to Generation's nuclear plants in those states receiving ZEC benefits, resulting in higher offers for those units that may not clear the capacity market. On Jan. 21, 2020, Exelon, PJM and a number of other entities submitted individual requests for rehearing. Exelon is currently working with PJM and other stakeholders to pursue the FRR option but cannot predict whether the legislative and regulatory changes can be implemented prior to the next capacity auction in PJM. If Generation’s state-supported nuclear plants in PJM or NYISO are subjected to the MOPR without compensation under an FRR or similar program, it could have a material adverse impact on Exelon's and Generation's financial statements.

•CENG Put Option: On Nov. 20, 2019, Generation received notice of EDF’s intention to exercise the put option to sell its 49.99% equity interest in CENG to Generation and the put automatically exercised on Jan. 19, 2020 at the end of the sixty-day advance notice period. Under the terms of the Put Option, the purchase price is to be determined by agreement of the parties, or absent such agreement, by a third-party arbitration process. Any resulting sale would be subject to the approval of the New York Public Service Commission, FERC and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The process and regulatory approvals could take one to two years or more to complete.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to net income as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items. This measure is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of period over period operating results and provide an indication of Exelon’s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentation. The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measure as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings should not be deemed more useful than, a substitute for, or an alternative to the most comparable GAAP Net Income measures provided in this earnings release and attachments. This press release and earnings release attachments provide reconciliations of adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, are posted on Exelon’s website: www.exeloncorp.com, and have been furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K on Feb. 11, 2020.
