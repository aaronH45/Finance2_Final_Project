 Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2019 Results  

 Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders for the full year was $2,877 million or $3.91 per diluted share, up $2,597 million from the prior year, primarily due to the $2,390 million gain recognized on the formation of NGM, as well as higher production from the acquired Goldcorp assets and higher average realized gold prices. Net income from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders for the quarter was $537 million or $0.66 per diluted share, an increase of $540 million from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher production from acquired assets and higher realized gold prices.  

 Adjusted net income was $970 million or $1.32 per diluted share for the full year, compared to $718 million or $1.34 per diluted share in the prior year. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $410, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to $214 or $0.40 in the prior year quarter. Primary adjustments to fourth quarter net income include $(0.11) related to changes in the fair value of investments, ($0.10) related to valuation allowances and tax effects of adjustments, and $0.05 related to other charges including reclamation and remediation charges, integration costs and restructuring.  

 Revenue increased 34 percent to $9,740 million for the full year and 45 percent to $2,967 million for the quarter, compared to the prior year. These increases were primarily due to new production from the acquired Goldcorp assets and higher average realized gold prices.  

 Average realized gold price5 was 11 percent higher for the full year at $1,399 per ounce and 20 percent higher for the quarter at $1,478 per ounce compared to prior year. The average realized price for copper was four percent lower for the full year at $2.63 per pound, and five percent higher for the quarter at $2.76 per pound, compared to the prior year. For the full year, the average realized price for silver, lead and zinc were $15.79 per ounce, $0.79 per pound and $0.80 per pound, respectively. For the quarter, the average realized price for silver, lead and zinc were $15.49 per ounce, $0.77 per pound and $0.78 per pound, respectively.  

 Gold CAS increased 19 percent to $4,663 million for the full year and 19 percent to $1,251 million for the quarter, compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional costs from the acquired Goldcorp assets. For the quarter, Gold CAS per ounce increased five percent to $691 per ounce primarily due to higher stripping ratios at Merian and Yanacocha and higher gold price-driven royalties. For the full year, Gold CAS per ounce increased by two percent to $721 per ounce primarily due to unfavorable stripping and higher gold price driven royalties partially offset by higher gold ounces sold and lower stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments.  

 Gold AISC increased six percent to $966 per ounce for the full year and increased 12 percent to $946 per ounce for the quarter, compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher gold CAS per ounce and higher sustaining capital spend.  

 Attributable gold production6 increased 23 percent to 6.29 million ounces for the full year and 27 percent to 1.83 million ounces for the quarter, compared to prior year, primarily due to new production from the Goldcorp assets and higher grade and throughput from the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion projects, partially offset by lower production from KCGM.  

 Attributable gold equivalent ounce (GEO) production from other metals increased to 624 thousand ounces for the full year and 229 thousand ounces for the quarter, compared to prior year, primarily due to new silver, lead and zinc production from Peñasquito, partially offset by the classification of Phoenix copper as a by-product following the formation of NGM. CAS from other metals totaled $532 million for the full year and $208 million for the quarter. CAS per GEO increased 10 percent to $858 per ounce for the full year, primarily due to high unit costs at Peñasquito. CAS per GEO decreased 4 percent to $791 per ounce for the quarter, primarily due to higher gold equivalent ounces of other metals sold and a favorable Australian dollar foreign currency exchange. AISC per GEO increased 31 percent to $1,222 per ounce for the full year and 21 percent to $1,171 per ounce for the quarter, compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher CAS per GEO, higher sustaining capital spend and higher treatment and refining costs.  

 Capital expenditures7 increased 42 percent to $1,463 million for the full year and 60 percent to $430 million for the quarter, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased sustaining capital for the Goldcorp assets and ongoing investment in growth projects, including Quecher Main, Ahafo Mill Expansion, Borden, Musselwhite Materials Handling, Tanami Expansion 2, Yanacocha Sulfides and Ahafo North.  

 Consolidated operating cash flow from continuing operations increased 57 percent to $2,876 million for the full year and 63 percent to $1,208 million for the quarter, compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher realized gold prices and the inclusion of sales from the Goldcorp assets. Free cash flow2 also increased to $1,413 million for the full year and $778 million for the quarter, compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher operating cash flow, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.  

 Balance sheet ended the quarter with $2.2 billion of consolidated cash and an investment-grade credit profile, issued $700 million of 2.800 percent Senior Notes due 2029 and retired $626 million of 5.125 percent Senior Notes due on October 1, 2019.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Corporate updates     Goldcorp transaction: On January 14, 2019, Newmont entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding common shares of Goldcorp. On April 18, 2019, Newmont closed its acquisition of Goldcorp following receipt of all regulatory approvals and approval by Newmont’s and Goldcorp’s shareholders of the resolutions at the shareholder meetings on April 11 and April 4, 2019, respectively, for total cash and non-cash consideration of $9,456 million in a primarily stock transaction. The combined company is known as Newmont Corporation, continuing to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker NEM and listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker NGT.   Nevada Gold Mines Joint Venture: On July 1, 2019, Newmont and Barrick Gold Corporation (Barrick) consummated the transaction establishing Nevada Gold Mines LLC (NGM). NGM is owned 38.5 percent by Newmont and owned 61.5 percent and operated by Barrick. The formation of NGM diversifies the Company’s footprint in Nevada and allows Newmont to benefit from additional efficiencies through integrated mine planning and processing. The Company accounts for its interest in NGM using the proportionate consolidation method, thereby recognizing its pro-rata share of the assets, liabilities and operations of NGM. Fourth quarter 2019 EBITDA for NGM was $267 million and for the year ended 2019 was $501 million. Attributable gold production was 366 thousand ounces with CAS of $722 per ounce and AISC of $883 per ounce for the fourth quarter 2019 and 710 thousand ounces with CAS of $712 per ounce and AISC of $901 per ounce for the year ended 2019.   

 Projects update  

 Newmont’s capital-efficient project pipeline supports stable production with improving margins and mine life. Near-term development capital projects are presented below. Funding for Tanami Expansion 2 and Musselwhite Materials Handling have been approved and the projects are in execution. Additional projects not listed below represent incremental improvements to production and cost guidance.    Tanami Expansion 2 (Australia) secures Tanami’s future as a long-life, low cost producer with potential to extend mine life to 2040 through the addition of a 1,460m hoisting shaft and supporting infrastructure to achieve 3.5Mt per year of production and provide a platform for future growth. The expansion is expected to increase average annual gold production by approximately 150,000 to 200,000 ounces per year for the first five years beginning in 2023, and is expected to reduce operating costs by approximately 10 percent. Capital costs for the project are estimated to be between $700 million and $800 million.   Musselwhite Materials Handling (North America) improves material movement from Musselwhite’s two main zones below Lake Opapimiskan. An underground shaft will hoist ore from the underground crushers, reducing haulage distances and ventilation costs. The Company expects the project to be fully operational in mid-2020.   

 Outlook  

 Newmont’s outlook reflects steady gold production and ongoing investment in its operating assets and most promising growth prospects. The Company does not include development projects that have not reached execution stage in its outlook which represents upside to guidance.  

 Attributable production  

 Attributable gold production is expected to be stable at 6.2 to 6.7 million ounces across the five year period. The 2020 outlook of 6.4 million ounces increases from 2019 with a full year of production from the acquired Goldcorp assets. Production is expected to remain between 6.2 and 6.7 million ounces per year longer-term through 2024 supported by a steady base from Boddington, Tanami, Ahafo, Peñasquito, and the Company’s equity ownership interest in the Nevada Gold Mines joint venture, which is further enhanced by solid production from the Company’s nine other operating mines and its equity ownership in Pueblo Viejo.  

 Regional production overview:  

 Australia  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2020: Full Potential at Boddington improves mining rates and grade increases throughout the year with the stripping campaign nearing completion in the South Pit and Tanami continues to deliver solid performance.  

 2021-2022: Boddington reaches higher grade ore while Tanami delivers steady performance.  

 Africa  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2020: A full year of production from the Ahafo Mill Expansion is offset by mine sequencing in both the Subika and Awonsu open pits, a change in mining method at Subika Underground and lower grades at Akyem.  

 2021-2022: Subika Underground begins to deliver higher tons and Subika open pit reaches higher grades, partially offset by sequencing at Akyem.  

 North America  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2020: A full year of operations at Peñasquito, Éléonore and Porcupine increase production. Peñasquito reaches higher grades and Musselwhite is expected to reach normal production levels in early October, partially offset by lower leach pad production at CC&V.  

 2021: Musselwhite contributes a full year of operations, Peñasquito continues in higher grade ore and achieves higher throughput, and Porcupine benefits from higher grades in the Borden underground and Hollinger open pit mines.  

 2022: Peñasquito is impacted by lower gold grade from mine sequencing.  

 South America*  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 *Includes Pueblo Viejo interest with ~375Koz in 2020 and 2021, and ~385Koz in 2022.  

 2020: A full year of production from Cerro Negro and Pueblo Viejo is partially offset by Yanacocha depleting higher grades at the Tapado Oeste pit and Merian transitioning to harder rock.  

 2021: Cerro Negro transitions to lower grades as mining concludes in the Eureka District and Yanacocha ramps down the oxide mill.  

 2022: Merian enters a stripping phase partially offset by higher grades at Cerro Negro.  

 Nevada Gold Mines (NGM)  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Production for the Company’s 38.5 percent ownership interest in NGM.  

 Attributable co-product GEOs  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2020: A full year of production from Peñasquito is partially offset by lower copper production at Boddington.  

 2021: Boddington copper production increases and Peñasquito delivers steady production.  

 2022-2024: Peñasquito delivers higher silver and lead production from the Chile Colorado pit, followed by higher silver and zinc production from the Peñasco pit.  

 Gold cost outlook    Costs improve throughout the five year period with continuing Full Potential improvements and ongoing investment in profitable projects.   CAS is expected to be $750 per ounce for 2020 from lower production in Africa and South America, partially offset by improvements in North America with a full year of operations at Peñasquito. CAS is expected to be between $650 and $750 per ounce for 2021 and 2022, and between $600 and $700 per ounce in 2023 and 2024.   AISC is expected to be $975 per ounce in 2020 from higher costs in South America and Africa, partially offset by improved CAS in North America. AISC is expected to be between $850 and $950 per ounce in 2021 and 2022, and improves to between $800 and $900 per ounce longer-term through 2024. Future Full Potential savings and profitable ounces from projects that are not yet approved represent additional upside not currently captured in guidance.   

 Regional cost overview:   

 Australia  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2020: CAS benefits from lower spend at Tanami for paste fill, partially offset by increased stockpile processing at Boddington. AISC includes increased sustaining capital spend at Boddington to advance Autonomous Haulage and at Tanami for ventilation.  

 2021-2022: Unit costs improve as Boddington production increases.  

 Africa  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2020: CAS is higher than 2019 on lower production at Akyem and Ahafo with stripping in the Subika open pit and the change in mining method at Subika Underground. AISC is higher on increased unit CAS partially offset by lower sustaining capital at Ahafo.  

 2021-2022: CAS improves from higher production at Ahafo with increased ore tons from Subika Underground and the end of stripping in the Subika open pit. AISC increases in 2021 on higher sustaining capital spend for tailings storage facilities at both Ahafo and Akyem.  

 North America  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2020: Unit costs improve as Peñasquito delivers a full year of production with Full Potential improvements and the removal higher cost production from Red Lake, partially offset by lower production at CC&V and higher costs at Musselwhite prior to resuming full operations in October.  

 2021-2022: Unit costs improve with increased production and the delivery of Full Potential improvements throughout the region.  

 South America  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2020: Unit costs increase on lower production at Yanacocha and from higher mine and milling costs at Merian from harder rock, partially offset by Full Potential improvements at Cerro Negro.  

 2021: Unit costs improve with lower operating costs at Yanacocha from the end of Quecher Main stripping and ramping down the oxide mill, partially offset by lower production at Cerro Negro.  

 2022: CAS increases with Merian entering a stripping campaign and Yanacocha production declining. AISC increases with CAS and higher sustaining capital at Cerro Negro.  

 Nevada Gold Mines  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 CAS & AISC for the Company’s 38.5 percent ownership interest in NGM.  

 Attributable co-product costs per GEO  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 2020: Unit costs improve driven by a full year of production at Peñasquito.  

 2021-2022: Unit costs per GEO increase from mine sequencing at Peñasquito, partially offset by higher copper production at Boddington.  

 2023-2024: CAS per GEO improves on higher production at Peñasquito and AISC per GEO improves on lower CAS and lower sustaining capital spend.  

 Consolidated Capital   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Sustaining capital remains steady, covering infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development.  

 Development capital includes Tanami Expansion 2 in Australia, Musselwhite Materials Handling in Canada, Subika Underground in Ghana, underground development at Cerro Negro in Argentina, expenditures related to the Company’s ownership interest in Nevada Gold Mines, and to progress studies for future projects. Yearly decreases reflect the Company’s approach to only including development projects that have reached execution stage.  

 Consolidated expense outlook – Interest expense is expected to be $300 million for 2020 from a full year of expense related to the acquired Goldcorp debt. Investment in exploration and advanced projects is expected to be $450 million in 2020 with a full year of spend for the acquired Goldcorp assets. The 2020 outlook for general & administrative costs is expected to be $265 million as synergies of $120 million are realized from the Goldcorp transaction and depreciation and amortization is expected to be $2,125 million.  

 Assumptions and sensitivities – Newmont’s outlook assumes $1,200 per ounce gold price, $16 per ounce silver price, $2.75 per pound copper price, $1.20 per pound zinc price, $0.95 per pound lead price, $0.75 USD/AUD exchange rate, $0.77 USD/CAD exchange rate, and $60 per barrel WTI oil price. Assuming a 35% incremental tax rate, $100 per ounce increase in gold price would deliver an expected $400 million improvement in attributable free cash flow.

 Valuation allowance and other tax adjustments, net, included in Income and mining tax benefit (expense), predominantly represent adjustments to remove the impact of our valuation allowances for items such as foreign tax credits, alternative minimum tax credits, capital losses and disallowed foreign losses. We believe that these valuation allowances cause significant fluctuations in our financial results that are not indicative of our underlying financial performance. The adjustments three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018 are due to an increase to the valuation allowance on U.S. net operating losses, credit carryovers, and other U.S. deferred tax assets of $159 and $191, respectively, other tax adjustments of $(7) and $(3), respectively, and a decrease to the valuation allowance on U.S. capital losses of $- and $(15), respectively.

 Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share is calculated using diluted common shares, which are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.    

 Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization and Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization  

 Management uses Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA adjusted for non-core or certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP, and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Although Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements by other companies, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Management’s determination of the components of Adjusted EBITDA are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The 2018 charges include adjustments at the Idarado, Lone Tree and Rain remediation and closure sites.    

 (6)      

 Loss (gain) on asset and investment sales, included in Other income, net, primarily represents a gain on the sale of exploration land in 2019 and a gain from the exchange of certain royalty interests for cash consideration and an equity ownership and warrants in Maverix in 2018.

 The Company uses NGM EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure to evaluate the operating performance of its investment in Nevada Gold Mines (NGM). NGM EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, Income (loss) before income and mining tax and other items, as defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash distributions from NGM will be consistent with NGM EBITDA. Although the Company has the ability to exert significant influence and proportionally consolidates its 38.5% interest in NGM, it does not have direct control over the operations or resulting revenues and expenses of its investment in NGM. The Company believes that NGM EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the operating results of its investment in NGM, in the same manner as management and the Board of Directors. Income (loss) before income and mining tax and other items is reconciled to NGM EBITDA as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    

 Free Cash Flow  

 Management uses Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. Free Cash Flow is Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of discontinued operations less Additions to property, plant and mine development as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company believes Free Cash Flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the Company’s performance with its competitors. Although Free Cash Flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the Company’s calculation of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies.  

 The presentation of non-GAAP Free Cash Flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company’s performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. The Company’s definition of Free Cash Flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, the Company believes it is important to view Free Cash Flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  

 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow, as well as information regarding Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities and Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities includes Additions to property, plant and mine development, which is included in the Company’s computation of Free Cash Flow.    

 Costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce   

 Costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and other metals by gold ounces or gold equivalent ounces sold, respectively. These measures are calculated for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.  

 The following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures

 All-In Sustaining Costs   

 Newmont has developed a metric that expands on GAAP measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-GAAP measures, such as costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations.  

 Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. Therefore, we believe that all-in sustaining costs is a non-GAAP measure that provides additional information to management, investors and analysts that aid in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production.  

 All-in sustaining cost (“AISC”) amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to AISC. Differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development (i.e. non-sustaining) activities based upon each company’s internal policies.  

 The following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the all-in sustaining costs measure:  

 Costs applicable to sales. Includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from Costs applicable to sales (“CAS”), such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. CAS includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. CAS is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes Depreciation and amortization and Reclamation and remediation, which is consistent with our presentation of CAS on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In determining AISC, only the CAS associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. Therefore, the amount of gold CAS included in AISC is derived from the CAS presented in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount of CAS attributable to the production of other metals at our Peñasquito, Boddington, and Phoenix mines. The other metals CAS at those mine sites is disclosed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito, Boddington, and Phoenix mines is based upon the relative sales value of gold and other metals produced during the period.  

 Reclamation costs. Includes accretion expense related to reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the related Asset Retirement Cost (“ARC”) for the Company’s operating properties. Accretion related to the reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the ARC assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with GAAP. The accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito, Boddington, and Phoenix mines.  

 Advanced projects, research and development and exploration. Includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to sustain current production and exploration. We note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves to sustain production at existing operations. As these costs relate to sustaining our production, and are considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the AISC measure. These costs are derived from the Advanced projects, research and development and Exploration amounts presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations less incurred expenses related to the development of new operations, or related to major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially benefit the operation in the future. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito, Boddington, and Phoenix mines.  

 General and administrative. Includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current production, but rather related to support our corporate structure and fulfill our obligations to operate as a public company. Including these expenses in the AISC metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis.  

 Other expense, net. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses from Other expense, net, such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current operations. Furthermore, this adjustment to Other expense, net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders as disclosed in the Company’s non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income (loss). The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito, Boddington, and Phoenix mines.  

 Treatment and refining costs. Includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable metal. These costs are presented net as a reduction of Sales on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito, Boddington, and Phoenix mines.  

 Sustaining capital and finance lease payments. We determined sustaining capital and finance lease payments as those capital expenditures and finance lease payments that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. Sustaining finance lease payments are included beginning in 2019 in connection with the adoption of ASC 842. Refer to Note 2 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. We determined development (i.e. non-sustaining) capital expenditures and finance lease payments to be those payments used to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations where those projects will materially benefit the operation. The classification of sustaining and development capital projects and finance leases is based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. Sustaining capital and finance lease payments are relevant to the AISC metric as these are needed to maintain the Company’s current operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals at the Peñasquito, Boddington, and Phoenix mines.

 Net debt to Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA ratio   

 Management uses net debt to Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA as non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance, including our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt. Net debt to Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA represents the ratio of the Company’s debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, to Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA. Net debt to Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Although Net Debt to Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements by other companies, our calculation of net debt to Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA measure is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. The Company believes that net debt to Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Management’s determination of the components of net debt to Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA is evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA as follows:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Represents Goldcorp’s pre-acquisition Adjusted EBITDA on a US GAAP basis from January 1, 2019 through to the acquisition date, April 18, 2019. This amount is added to our adjusted EBITDA to include a full twelve months of Goldcorp results on a pro forma basis for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The pro forma adjusted EBITDA was derived from Goldcorp management unaudited financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2019 through April 18, 2019, the acquisition date. Goldcorp’s pre-acquisition Adjusted EBITDA has been added to our adjusted EBITDA for the purposes of Net Debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA ratio only.    

 Net average realized price per ounce/ pound  

 Average realized price per ounce/ pound are non-GAAP financial measures. The measures are calculated by dividing the net consolidated gold, copper, silver, lead, and zinc sales by the consolidated gold ounces, copper pounds, silver ounces, lead pounds and zinc pounds sold, respectively. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Average realized price per ounce/ pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only, do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.  

 The following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure:  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Silver, lead and zinc sales are the result of the Newmont Goldcorp transaction.

 Per ounce measures may not recalculate due to rounding.    

 Gold by-product metrics   

 Copper, silver, lead, and zinc are by-products often obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. In our GAAP Consolidated Financial Statements, the value of these by-products is recorded as a credit to our CAS and the value of the primary ore is recorded as Sales. In certain instances, copper, silver, lead, and zinc are co-products, or significant resource in the primary ore-body, and the revenue is recorded as Sales in our GAAP Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 Gold by-product metrics are non-GAAP financial measures that serve as a basis for comparing the Company’s performance with certain competitors. As Newmont’s operations are primarily focused on gold production, “Gold by-product metrics” were developed to allow investors to view Sales, CAS per ounce and AISC per ounce calculations that classify all copper, silver, lead, and zinc production as a by-product, even when copper, silver, lead or zinc is a significant resource in primary ore-body. These metrics are calculated by subtracting copper, silver, lead, and zinc sales recognized from Sales and including these amounts as offsets to CAS.  

 Gold by-product Metrics are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. These metrics are intended to provide supplemental information only, do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks, such as in IFRS.

 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements, Including Outlook:   

 This news release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws. Where a forward-looking statement expresses or implies an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed, projected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition; and often contain words such as “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “would,” “estimate,” “expect,” “believe,” “target,” “indicative,” “preliminary,” or “potential.” Forward-looking statements in this news release may include, without limitation, (i) estimates of future production and sales, including production outlook, average future production, upside potential and indicative production profiles; (ii) estimates of future costs applicable to sales and all-in sustaining costs; (iii) estimates of future consolidated and attributable capital expenditures, including development and sustaining capital; (iv) estimates of future cost reductions, full potential savings, value creation, improvements, synergies and efficiencies; (v) expectations regarding the development, growth and exploration potential of the Company’s operations, projects and investments, including, without limitation, returns, IRR, schedule, decision dates, mine life, commercial start, first production, capital average production, average costs, impacts of improvement or expansion projects and upside potential; (vi) expectations regarding future investments or divestitures; (vii) expectations regarding free cash flow, future dividends plans, share repurchases and returns to stockholders; (viii) expectations regarding future mineralization, including, without limitation, expectations regarding reserves and recoveries; (ix) estimates of future closure costs and liabilities; (x) expectations regarding the timing and/or likelihood of future borrowing, future debt repayment, financial flexibility and cash flow; (xi) expectations regarding the future success of exploration, development of the project pipeline, on-going integration work and Nevada joint venture; (xii) expectations regarding expense outlook, including G&A, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and tax rate, and (xiii) expectations regarding closing of pending divestitures, including Red Lake and the Company’s stake in Continental Gold. Estimates or expectations of future events or results are based upon certain assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect. Such assumptions, include, but are not limited to: (i) there being no significant change to current geotechnical, metallurgical, hydrological and other physical conditions; (ii) permitting, development, operations and expansion of operations and projects being consistent with current expectations and mine plans, including, without limitation, receipt of export approvals; (iii) political developments in any jurisdiction in which the Company operates being consistent with its current expectations; (iv) certain exchange rate assumptions being approximately consistent with current levels; (v) certain price assumptions for gold, copper, silver, zinc, lead and oil; (vi) prices for key supplies being approximately consistent with current levels; (vii) the accuracy of current mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates; (viii) other planning assumptions, and (ix) the timely satisfaction of closing conditions and receipt of approvals in connection with pending divestitures .. In addition, with respect to plans related to future dividends, investors are cautioned that declaration and payment of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be determined based on Newmont’s financial results, balance sheet strength, cash and liquidity requirements, future prospects, gold price fluctuations and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. The planned dividend increase reflects management’s expectations. However, 2020 dividends have not yet been approved or declared by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors reserves all powers related to the declaration and payment of dividends. Consequently, in determining the dividend to be declared and paid on the common stock of the Company, the Board of Directors may revise or terminate such dividend plans at any time without prior notice. Further, with respect to the stock repurchase program, investors are reminded that the extent to which the Company repurchases its shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including trading volume, market conditions, legal requirements, business conditions and other factors. As such, no guarantees can be made with respect to the impact of the program. The repurchase program may be discontinued at any time, and the program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares of its common stock. For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors that might impact future looking statements, see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), under the heading “Risk Factors”, available on the SEC website or www.newmont.com. The Company does not undertake any obligation to release publicly revisions to any “forward-looking statement,” including, without limitation, outlook, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this news release, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Investors should not assume that any lack of update to a previously issued “forward-looking statement” constitutes a reaffirmation of that statement. Continued reliance on “forward-looking statements” is at investors’ own risk.  

 The “reserves” disclosed in this release have been prepared in compliance with Industry Guide 7 published by the SEC. As used in this news release, the term “reserve” means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. The term “economically,” as used in this definition, means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated in a feasibility study to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The term “legally,” as used in this definition, does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved. However, for a reserve to exist, Newmont must have a justifiable expectation, based on applicable laws and regulations, that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with Newmont’s current mine plans. Reserves in this news release are aggregated from the proven and probable classes. For a breakdown, please see the Company’s Annual Report for the “Proven and Probable Reserve” and “Mineralized Material” tables prepared in compliance with the SEC’s Industry Guide 7, available at www.newmont.com and on www.sec.gov. Investors are reminded that reserves notes in this release are estimates as of December 31, 2019.
