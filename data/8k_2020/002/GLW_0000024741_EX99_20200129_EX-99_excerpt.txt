 Corning Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2019 Financial Results and   

 Affirms Outlook for Long-Term Growth  

 ﻿  

 CORNING, N.Y. – Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW) today announced results for fourth-quarter and full-year 2019.   

 ﻿  

 “In 2019, we grew sales 2% driven by strong performance in three businesses. We advanced key growth initiatives and took actions to address the material impact of changing market and customer dynamics in Display Technologies and Optical Communications,” said Wendell P. Weeks, chairman, chief executive officer, and president. “While our 2019 growth did not meet long-term targets, we once again outperformed our underlying markets and expect to build momentum throughout 2020 that will keep us on track to achieve the goals set forth in our four-year Strategy & Growth Framework.”   

 ﻿  

 2019 Highlights  

 ﻿  

   ·    Corning successfully delivered on its 2016-2019 Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework goals, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders over four years, including a 67% increase in dividends per share, while investing to advance longer-term growth initiatives  

   ·    All businesses outperformed their underlying markets, with significant growth in three segments 

   o    Environmental Technologies grew sales 16% in an auto market that was down mid-single digits, driven by the adoption of Corning’s proprietary gasoline particulate filter (GPF) innovation  

   o    Specialty Materials grew sales 8% with adoption of industry-leading cover glass innovations despite smartphone unit sales being down 3%  

   o    Life Sciences reached a $1 billion sales milestone, growing at nearly twice the rate of a strengthening market 

   ·    Corning’s display glass pricing reached low-single digit percentage declines for the year 

   ·    The company significantly advanced product commercialization of Corning Valor® Glass, with FDA approval and commercial agreements, and in Automotive Glass Solutions, with the opening of a dedicated factory to support growing demand from industry leaders 

 ﻿  

 Financial Performance   

 ﻿  

   ·    Fourth-quarter GAAP sales of $2.82 billion and core sales of $2.85 billion; full-year GAAP sales of $11.5 billion and core sales of $11.7 billion  

   ·    Fourth-quarter GAAP EPS of $0.01 and core EPS of $0.46; full-year GAAP EPS of $1.07 and core EPS of $1.76. The primary difference between GAAP and core results were charges associated with capacity realignment  

   ·    Growth in three businesses within Corning’s focused and cohesive portfolio mitigated the impact of headwinds in other markets, enabling 2% overall sales growth for the year  

 ﻿  

 “In the fourth quarter, Corning delivered on sales and EPS expectations, and generated over $1 billion in adjusted operating cash flow,” said Tony Tripeny, executive vice president and chief financial officer. “We accelerated actions in Optical Communications to align production output and working capital to current customer demand. This impacted gross margin, which was below our guidance for the fourth quarter.”

 2019 Market-Access Platforms Progress Highlights  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   ·    Optical Communications: Continued to co-innovate with industry leaders to advance 5G and hyperscale data center solutions that increase network efficiency – exemplified by new collaborations with Intel, Verizon, CenturyLink, and Altice Portugal; earned global recognition for products including RocketRibbon™ extreme-density cable for hyperscale data centers  

   ·    Mobile Consumer Electronics: Extended industry leadership with next-generation cover glass solutions and deepened customer commitments, including an additional $250 million investment from Apple, setting the stage for strong adoption of continued innovations  

   ·    Life Sciences Vessels: Signed commercial agreements with three leading pharmaceutical companies, building on the announcement that a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer received FDA approval of Corning Valor Glass for use as a primary package for a marketed drug product; advanced leadership in key growth categories – cell culture and gene therapy – by innovating and increasing capacity for market-leading solutions 

   ·    Display: Continued progress toward stable returns; created richer entertainment experiences through display glass innovation; advanced leadership in Gen 10.5 glass, supporting the growth of large-size TVs; Corning display glass pricing remained moderate 

 ﻿  

 2020-2023 Strategy & Growth Framework outlook  

 ﻿  

 Corning remains confident in its Strategy & Growth Framework goals. Under the Framework, the company will continue to focus its portfolio and utilize its financial strength to capture significant organic growth and create additional value for shareholders over the next four years. Through 2023, Corning expects to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual sales growth and 12% to 15% compound annual earnings per share growth while investing $10 billion to $12 billion in RD&E, capital and mergers, and acquisitions. The company also plans to expand operating margin and ROIC, and deliver $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders, including annual dividend per share increases of at least 10%.   

 ﻿  

 “To deliver our Strategy & Growth Framework goals, we expect to add an incremental $3 billion to $4 billion in annual sales and improve profitability by the end of 2023. We are confident in our ability to achieve these goals because we are closely aligned with major growth drivers in each of our Market-Access Platforms, positioning us to create and sell into new product categories. In short, we plan to drive more Corning technologies into the products consumers already buy,” Weeks said. “This provides a mechanism for us to grow – even in challenging environments.”   

 ﻿  

 “We believe the benefits of this approach are already manifesting themselves. In Automotive we grew Environmental sales 16% while car sales were down. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we grew Specialty Materials sales 8% while smartphone units were down. In Life Sciences, we exceeded industry growth on the strength of new products for cell culture and gene therapy,” Weeks continued.

 Segment Results and Outlook  

 “We are confident in our long-term outlook and remain focused on key operational priorities that will help accelerate growth and position us to achieve the goals of our Strategy & Growth Framework. We’re successfully ramping our next Gen 10.5 plants, aligning costs and capacity to current demand, and commercializing innovations to support our customers,” Tripeny said.  

 ﻿  

 “In 2020, we expect continued growth in Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies, and Life Sciences. We also expect to return to sales and profit growth and expand margins as a company in the second half as volume in Display Technologies and Optical Communications improves,” added Tripeny.  

 ﻿  

 Display Technologies:   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Full-year sales in Display Technologies were $3.3 billion, and net income was $786 million. Corning’s glass volume was up mid-single digits, higher than the overall market, driven by increased Gen 10.5 output during the year. The company’s display glass pricing improved to low-single digit percentage declines for the year.  

 ﻿  

 Fourth-quarter sales were $795 million, and net income was $180 million. In the fourth-quarter Corning’s display glass volume grew low-single digits sequentially.  

 ﻿  

 For full-year 2020, Corning expects its display glass volume to grow by a mid-single digit percentage, similar to the mid-single digit growth expected in the display glass market. The company expects glass price declines to remain moderate, down mid-single digits for the full year.  

 ﻿  

 In the first quarter, Corning’s display glass volume is expected to be down low-single digits sequentially.

 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

 ﻿  

 CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES  

 In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to report core performance measures. These items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates. Corning utilizes constant-currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and new Taiwan dollar currencies. Effective January 1, 2019, Corning also began using constant-currency reporting for our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments for the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. The Company believes that the use of constant-currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows. Corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.  

 ﻿  

 Core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”). We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures. With respect to the Company’s outlook for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast the movement of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control. As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.  

 ﻿  

 Effective July 1, 2019, we have replaced the term “Core Earnings” with “Core Net Income”. The terms are interchangeable and the underlying calculations remain the same.  

 ﻿  

 For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures”.
