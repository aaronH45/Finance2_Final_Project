Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and to inherent risks and uncertainties, such as those disclosed or incorporated by reference in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any forward-looking statement made by or on our behalf included or incorporated by reference in this document include, without limitation: declining physical mail volumes; expenses and potential impact on client relationships resulting from the October 2019 malware attack that temporarily affected our operations; a breach of security, including a future cyber-attack or other comparable event; the continued availability and security of key information technology systems and the cost to comply with information security requirements and privacy laws; changes in, or loss of, our contractual relationships with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) or posts in other major markets; changes in postal regulations; competitive factors, including pricing pressures, technological developments and the introduction of new products and services by competitors; the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (Brexit); our success in developing and marketing new products and services and obtaining regulatory approvals, if required; changes in banking regulations or the loss of our Industrial Bank charter; changes in labor conditions and transportation costs; macroeconomic factors, including global and regional business conditions that adversely impact customer demand, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; changes in global political conditions and international trade policies, including the imposition or expansion of trade tariffs; third-party suppliers’ ability to provide products and services required by our clients; our success at managing the relationships with outsource providers, including the costs of outsourcing functions and operations; capital market disruptions or credit rating downgrades that adversely impact our ability to access capital markets at reasonable costs; our success at managing customer credit risk; integrating newly acquired businesses, including operations and product and service offerings; our ability to continue to grow volumes to gain additional economies of scale; the loss of some of our larger clients in our Commerce Services group; intellectual property infringement claims; significant changes in pension, health care and retiree medical costs; income tax adjustments or other regulatory levies from tax audits and changes in tax laws, rulings or regulations; the use of the postal system for transmitting harmful biological agents, illegal substances or other terrorist attacks; and acts of nature.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements in this document, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Forward-looking statements in this document speak only as of the date hereof, and forward-looking statements in documents attached or incorporated by reference speak only as of the date of those documents.
