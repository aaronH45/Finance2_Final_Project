PROVIDES 2020 FULL-YEAR EARNINGS GUIDANCE; REVISES 

2020 - 2022 ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS GROWTH OBJECTIVE; REVISES TERMS OF JUUL TRANSACTION

RICHMOND, Va. - January 30, 2020 - Altria Group, Inc. (Altria) (NYSE: MO) today announces its 2019 fourth-quarter and full-year business results, provides guidance for 2020 full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) and revises its adjusted diluted EPS objective for the years 2020 through 2022.

“Altria’s core tobacco businesses delivered outstanding performance in 2019. In addition, Altria exceeded its $575 million annualized cost savings target and increased the dividend for the 54th time in 50 years,” said Howard Willard, Altria’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 

“Despite the unexpected challenges related to our investment in JUUL, which led to impairment charges and reported losses, we made significant progress advancing and building our noncombustible business platform with the launch of IQOS and completion of the on! transaction. We enter 2020 with continued focus on harm reduction. We believe Altria’s enhanced business platform best positions us to succeed under various future category scenarios.” 

As previously announced, a conference call with the investment community and news media will be webcast on January 30, 2020 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Access to the webcast is available at www.altria.com/webcasts and via the Altria Investor app.

Cash Returns to Shareholders

Dividends:

•Altria’s current annualized dividend rate is $3.36 per share, representing an annualized dividend yield of 6.8% as of January 27, 2020 and an increase of 5.0% from 2018.

•Altria expects to maintain a dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of adjusted diluted EPS for the years 2020 through 2022. Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of Altria’s Board of Directors (Board). 

Share Repurchase Program: 

•Altria repurchased 16.5 million shares in 2019 at an average price of $51.24 per share, for a total cost of approximately $845 million.

•As of December 31, 2019, Altria had $500 million remaining in the current $1 billion share repurchase program, which Altria expects to complete by the end of 2020. The timing of share repurchases depends on marketplace conditions and other factors, and this program remains subject to the discretion of the Board. 

Noncombustible Products Business Platform

IQOS  Heated Tobacco System 

•IQOS is now commercialized in the Atlanta, Georgia and Richmond, Virginia lead markets.

•Heatsticks are distributed across more than 500 retail stores in Atlanta and Richmond combined.

•There are now more than 100+ trained IQOS professionals to provide guided trials to adult smokers.

on! Oral Nicotine Pouches

•on! is now available in 15,000 stores nationally, including 3 of the top 5 chains for smokeless volume. 

•Helix expects to begin manufacturing on! at the Richmond Manufacturing Center in first-quarter 2020.

Cost Reduction Program 

•Altria achieved $600 million in annualized cost savings in 2019, exceeding the target $575 million annualized cost reduction program announced in December 2018 (Cost Reduction Program). The program included savings from workforce reductions, third-party spending reductions and the closure of Altria’s Nu Mark operations. 

JUUL Investment 

•Altria recorded a fourth-quarter, non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $4.1 billion related to its investment in JUUL. This impairment is primarily due to the increased number of legal cases pending against JUUL and the expectation that the number of legal cases against JUUL will continue to increase. Since October 31, 2019, the number of legal cases pending against JUUL has increased by more than 80%. Altria has not made any assumptions, or drawn any conclusions, regarding the merits or likelihood of success of any of these cases, litigation is subject to uncertainty and it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases. For 2019, Altria recorded a total of $8.6 billion in non-cash pre-tax impairment charges to its JUUL investment, bringing the value of its JUUL investment to $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2019.

•Altria now expects a resolution with respect to antitrust clearance in the first half of 2020.

Revised Terms for Investment in JUUL 

Altria and JUUL agreed to revised terms governing Altria’s minority investment in JUUL, which include the following provisions:

•Altria and JUUL are focusing their work together to create compelling pre-market tobacco product applications (PMTA) based on rigorous scientific research and data-driven underage use prevention efforts. As a result, Altria will continue providing regulatory affairs services to JUUL, which includes supporting the company in preparing and submitting its PMTA. Altria will discontinue all other services by the end of March 2020 that were part of the original investment agreement.

•JUUL will, upon antitrust clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, restructure its board of directors to consist of two directors designated by Altria, three independent directors, the JUUL CEO and three directors designated by JUUL stockholders other than Altria.

•Upon antitrust clearance, the restructured JUUL Board of Directors will add a nominating committee and a litigation oversight committee to its existing compensation and audit committees.

•Altria has the option to be released from its non-compete obligation if JUUL is prohibited by federal law from selling e-vapor products in the U.S. for at least a year, or if Altria’s carrying value of the JUUL investment is not more than 10% of its initial carrying value of $12.8 billion.

“This agreement is a continuation of the reset initiated by JUUL’s leadership team.” said Willard. “We look forward to working with the company under this structure to support JUUL’s commitment to working with regulators and submitting the best possible PMTA.” 

For more information, see the Form 8-K that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Expected Accounting Methodology for Investment in JUUL

Upon antitrust clearance, Altria expects to account for its equity investment in JUUL using the fair value option. Under the fair value option, Altria’s income statement will include any cash dividends received from the investment and any quarterly changes in the fair value of the investment. Quarterly changes in the fair value of the investment will be treated as a special item and excluded from adjusted diluted EPS.

2020 - 2022 Adjusted Diluted EPS Growth Objective

Altria lowers its compounded annual adjusted diluted EPS growth objective to 4% to 7% for the years 2020 through 2022 from its previously announced objective of 5% to 8%, primarily to reflect Altria’s current expectation for no equity earnings contributions from JUUL through 2022. 

2020 Full-Year Guidance

Altria expects its 2020 full-year adjusted diluted EPS to be in a range of $4.39 to $4.51, representing a growth rate of 4% to 7% from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $4.22 in 2019, as shown in Table 1. Altria’s 2020 guidance reflects increased investments related to PM USA’s commercialization efforts for IQOS, Helix’s plans to manufacture and expand U.S. distribution of on! and one extra shipping day in the first quarter.

The guidance range excludes estimated per share charges in 2020 of $0.05 of tax expense resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform Act) related to a tax basis adjustment to Altria’s ABI investment.

Altria expects the 2020 full-year total domestic cigarette industry adjusted volume decline rate to be in a range of 4% to 6%, which includes the impact of federal legislation raising the minimum age to purchase all tobacco products to 21. Altria expects continued volatility across tobacco categories and will no longer provide a multi-year forecast for U.S. cigarette volume declines. 

3

Altria expects its 2020 full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be in a range of 23.5% to 24.5%.

Altria expects its 2020 capital expenditures to be between $225 million and $275 million and depreciation and

amortization expenses of approximately $240 million.

Altria’s full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance and full-year forecast for its adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations. These items may include, for example, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, equity investment-related special items (including any changes in fair value for the equity investment and any related warrants and preemptive rights), certain tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items, and resolutions of certain nonparticipating manufacturer (NPM) adjustment disputes under the Master Settlement Agreement (such dispute resolutions are referred to as NPM Adjustment Items).

Altria’s management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of certain income and expense items, including those items noted in the preceding paragraph, on its reported diluted EPS or its reported effective tax rate because these items,which could be significant, may be unusual or infrequent, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. As a result, Altria does not provide a corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measure for, or reconciliation to, its adjusted diluted EPS guidance or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast.

The factors described in the “Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements” section of this release represent continuing risks to Altria’s forecast.

For other trade classes selling cigarettes, retail share is based on shipments from wholesalers to retailers (STARS). This service is not designed to capture sales through other channels, including the internet, direct mail and some illicitly tax-advantaged outlets.

Note: The smokeless products retail share results exclude international volume and oral nicotine pouch volume. Retail share results for smokeless products are based on data from IRI InfoScan, a tracking service that uses a sample of stores to project market share and depict share trends. This service tracks sales in the food, drug, mass merchandisers, convenience, military, dollar store and club trade classes on the number of cans and packs sold. Smokeless products is defined by IRI as moist smokeless and spit-free tobacco products. New types of smokeless products, as well as new packaging configurations of existing smokeless products, may or may not be equivalent to existing MST products on a can-for-can basis. For example, one pack of snus, irrespective of the number of pouches in the pack, is assumed to be equivalent to one can of MST. Because this service represents retail share performance only in key trade channels, it should not be considered a precise measurement of actual retail share. It is IRI’s standard practice to periodically refresh its InfoScan services, which could restate retail share results that were previously released in this service.

Basis of Presentation

Altria reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. Altria’s management reviews OCI, which is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, the segments. Altria’s management also reviews certain financial results, including OCI, OCI margins and diluted EPS, on an adjusted basis, which excludes certain income and expense items, including those items noted under “2020 Full-Year Guidance.” Altria’s management does not view any of these special items to be part of Altria’s underlying results as they may be highly variable, may be unusual or infrequent, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. Altria’s management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis. Altria’s adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate. Altria’s management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results. Altria’s management uses adjusted financial measures for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. These adjusted financial measures are not consistent with GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. These adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of historical adjusted financial measures to corresponding GAAP measures are provided in this release.

Altria uses the equity method of accounting for its investment in ABI and Cronos and reports its share of ABI’s and Cronos’s results using a one-quarter lag because ABI’s and Cronos’s results are not available in time to record them in the concurrent period. The one-quarter reporting lag for ABI and Cronos does not affect Altria’s cash flows. Altria accounts for its investment in JUUL as an investment in an equity security. If and when antitrust clearance is obtained, Altria expects to account for its investment in JUUL under the fair value option.

Altria’s reportable segments are smokeable products, including combustible cigarettes and cigars manufactured and sold by PM USA, Middleton and Nat Sherman; smokeless products, including moist smokeless tobacco and snus products manufactured and sold by USSTC, and oral nicotine pouches sold by Helix; and wine, produced and/or distributed by Ste. Michelle. Results for innovative tobacco products and PMCC are included in “All Other.”

Comparisons are to the corresponding prior-year period unless otherwise stated.
