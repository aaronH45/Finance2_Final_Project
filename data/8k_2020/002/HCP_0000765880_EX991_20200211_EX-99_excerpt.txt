NAREIT FFO, FFO as Adjusted, FAD, and SPP Cash NOI are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful in evaluating the operating performance of real estate investment trusts (see the "Funds From Operations" and "Funds Available for Distribution" sections of this release for additional information). See "December 31, 2019 Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for definitions, discussions of their uses and inherent limitations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP on the Investor Relations section of our website at http://ir.healthpeak.com/quarterly-results.

LIFE SCIENCE ACQUISITION

In January 2020, Healthpeak executed a definitive agreement to acquire a $320 million, 426,000 square foot Class A life science campus known as The Post, located in Waltham, within the Route 128 submarket of Boston, Massachusetts and less than one mile from Healthpeak’s Hayden Research Campus. The 36-acre campus is 100% leased to four well-established biopharmaceutical and innovation companies, with a weighted average lease term of 11 years and contractual annual escalations of approximately 3%. With an expansive physical footprint and superior build quality, The Post is seeking LEED® certification. The acquisition strengthens Healthpeak’s presence in the Boston market, expanding its footprint to 1.8 million square feet (including Healthpeak's active and near-term development pipeline). Additionally, the property has the potential for increased density which may be considered at a future date. 

The stabilized cash and GAAP capitalization rates are 5.1% and 6.5%, respectively. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. 

HAYDEN RESEARCH CAMPUS DEVELOPMENT LEASING ACTIVITY

In January 2020, Healthpeak and its partner King Street Properties, signed two leases totaling 122,000 square feet at its $160 million 75 Hayden development in Boston, Massachusetts. Each 10-year lease is with a publicly-traded biotech company. The 214,000 square foot Class A development project is now 57% pre-leased with both tenants expected to assume occupancy in the fourth quarter of this year. 

75 Hayden is located within Healthpeak’s Hayden Research campus, which will encompass approximately 600,000 square feet of state-of-the-art life science space in the Boston suburb of Lexington. 

CAPITAL SENIOR LIVING ("CSU") AGREEMENT

In February 2020, Healthpeak executed an agreement with CSU to convert the six properties in the master lease due 2026 into a RIDEA structure effective February 1, 2020. The annual rent on the properties is currently $4.4 million, and the underlying EBITDAR was $3.7 million for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Healthpeak is actively marketing the six properties for sale and expects to close on the dispositions in the next six to twelve months.

In October 2019, Healthpeak entered into an agreement for the early termination of a separate nine-property master lease with CSU, originally scheduled to mature in October 2020. As part of the agreement, Healthpeak converted one property from a triple-net lease to RIDEA and transitioned management to Discovery Senior Living. Healthpeak is marketing the remaining eight assets for sale. 

Upon completion of these transactions, Healthpeak will have no investments with CSU.

The newly built and 100% leased property is adjacent to Healthpeak's recently acquired property at 87 CambridgePark Drive and future development opportunity at 101 CambridgePark Drive. Combined, Healthpeak has created up to 440,000 square feet of contiguous space across a modern campus.  

THE BOARDWALK LIFE SCIENCE DEVELOPMENT 

In December 2019, Healthpeak announced the addition of a $164 million life science project to its development pipeline. The Boardwalk, totaling 190,000 square feet, is located on Science Center Drive in the Torrey Pines life science cluster in San Diego. The campus will combine three adjacent Healthpeak holdings, activating two land sites through 105,000 square feet of ground-up development that will flank both sides of an existing 85,000 square foot property that will also be redeveloped. Construction at The Boardwalk commenced in the fourth quarter, with expected occupancy in the second quarter of 2021. Upon stabilization, the campus is projected to generate an estimated yield on cost of 7%. A copy of the corresponding press release with additional details is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at http://ir.healthpeak.com. 

LIFE SCIENCE LEASING ACTIVITY 

In January 2020, Healthpeak announced it executed a long-term lease with Janssen BioPharma, Inc., part of the Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies, for approximately 60% of Phase II of The Shore at Sierra Point. The lease is expected to commence in January 2022, upon completion of construction. Janssen BioPharma, Inc. has expansion rights under the lease that can be exercised over the course of 2020. Healthpeak also designed and entitled additions to the project such that Phase II of The Shore at Sierra Point will represent approximately 298,000 square feet, an increase from the initial plan for 266,000 square feet. 

In December 2019, Healthpeak announced a lease amendment and extension with Amgen at Healthpeak's Britannia Oyster Point campus in South San Francisco. This campus consists of ten buildings totaling over 900,000 square feet of Class-A life science space. Amgen currently leases space in seven of the ten buildings, three of which are subleased by Amgen to third parties. The amendment provides Amgen the ability to extend the leases at three of the buildings it currently occupies through 2029, while at the same time providing Amgen flexibility to terminate its occupancy in these buildings at earlier dates subject to advance notice requirements.
