Item 8.01. Other Events

On Feb. 5, 2020, Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo), a Colorado corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc. (Xcel Energy), filed a request with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) seeking a net increase to retail gas rates of $127 million, reflecting a $145 million increase in base rate revenue, which is partially offset by $18 million previously authorized through the Pipeline System Integrity Adjustment (PSIA) rider mechanism. The request is based on a test year that incorporates actual capital and expenses as of Sept. 30, 2019, adjusted for known and measurable differences for the 12-month period ended Sept. 30, 2020, a 9.95% ROE and an equity ratio of 55.81%. Proposed effective date is Nov. 1, 2020.

The request reflects $1.3 billion of capital additions since the 2016 test year used to set current rates. Capital investments are made to maintain the safety and reliability of the natural gas system, along with investments to connect new customers and perform mandated infrastructure relocation work.

Timing of a CPUC ruling is expected in the second half of 2020.
