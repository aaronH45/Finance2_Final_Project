Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

Election of Director

On February 19, 2020, the Board of Directors of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation ("Pinnacle West") expanded the number of Directors on the Pinnacle West Board of Directors by one and elected Ms. Glynis A. Bryan as a Director. Ms. Bryan’s initial term will extend until the Pinnacle West 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 20, 2020 (the “2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders”). The Board of Directors of Arizona Public Service Company (“APS”), the principal subsidiary of Pinnacle West, also elected Ms. Bryan to the APS Board of Directors. Ms. Bryan has been appointed to the Audit Committee and the Nuclear and Operating Committee of Pinnacle West. Ms. Bryan will participate in the compensation arrangements for non-employee directors described on pages 40-41 of the Pinnacle West Proxy Statement for its Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 15, 2019, except the annual retainer and equity grant will be prorated to reflect her service from the date of her election until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

Ms. Bryan is the Chief Financial Officer of Insight Enterprises, Inc. (“Insight”). Insight is a technology company and a vendor of APS providing information technology services and computer hardware and software products. For these products and services, APS paid less than $6,700,000 to Insight in 2019, which is less than 1% of the Company’s and Insight’s revenues for 2019. Because the amounts paid to Insight were such a small portion of its total revenues, the Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors of Pinnacle West has determined that these payments are not material to Ms. Bryan and that she is independent under the applicable independence standards.

Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

Amendment of Bylaws to Reduce Special Meeting Threshold

On February 19, 2020, the Board of Directors of Pinnacle West approved amendments to the Company’s Bylaws. Section 2.02 of the Bylaws was amended to reduce the ownership threshold to call a special meeting of shareholders from 25% to 15% of the outstanding capital stock of the Company entitled to vote on the matter or matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting. Section 2.02 of the Bylaws was also amended to include a requirement that qualifying shares are net long shares held for at least a one-year period, as described in Section 2.02.

This summary is qualified by reference to the complete text of the amended Bylaws attached as Exhibit 3.1 to this report.
