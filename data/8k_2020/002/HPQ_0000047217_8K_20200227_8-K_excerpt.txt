(d) Effective February 27, 2020, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of HP Inc. (“HP”) expanded the size of the Board to thirteen members and appointed Richard L. Clemmer to fill the resulting vacancy. As previously announced, the size of the Board will be reduced by one upon the effectiveness of Dion Weisler’s previously announced departure from the Board in connection with the 2020 Annual Meeting, with the result that the size of the Board will be twelve.

Mr. Clemmer will receive compensation for service as a non-employee director of the Company on terms generally consistent with the compensation provided to other non-employee directors, as determined by the Board from time to time. There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Clemmer and any other persons pursuant to which Mr. Clemmer was selected as a director. Mr. Clemmer has no direct or indirect material interest in any transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
