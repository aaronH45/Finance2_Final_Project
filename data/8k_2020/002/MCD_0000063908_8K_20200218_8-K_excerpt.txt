Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers

Grants to Certain Executive Officers under the Target Incentive Plan (“TIP”) for 2020

The Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of McDonald's Corporation (the “Company”) approved the payout structure for the 2020 TIP for executives.

The target 2020 TIP payout for Kevin Ozan, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, is 110% of his year-end base salary. The Company has previously disclosed the 2020 target TIP payouts for Messrs. Kempczinski and Erlinger in connection with their respective promotions in November 2019. 

TIP payouts will be determined by the Company's 2020 performance on three key performance metrics: operating income, comparable guest counts and Systemwide sales (which include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees). Each of these metrics are measured on a consolidated or business segment level basis, as applicable to each individual. For Messrs. Kempczinski and Ozan the payout will be based on consolidated performance. For Mr. Erlinger, the payout will be based on a combination of the performance of McDonald's USA and consolidated performance.

The maximum TIP payout that any individual can earn in 2020 is 200% of target.

For compensation purposes, performance results may be adjusted from that reported in our financial statements in order to focus our executives on the fundamentals of the Company’s underlying business performance. Any adjustments are considered by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors pursuant to pre-established guidelines, including materiality. For example, operating income is expressed in constant currencies to neutralize the impact of foreign currency translation.
