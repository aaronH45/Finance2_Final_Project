Atlanta, Georgia, February 19, 2020 -- Genuine Parts Company (NYSE: GPC) announced today financial results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2019.

Sales for the fourth quarter were $4.7 billion, a 2.2% increase compared to $4.6 billion for the same period in 2018. Total sales included 0.5% comparable growth and approximately 6.7% from acquisitions, offset by a 4.2% decline due to the sale of EIS, Inc (EIS) and Grupo Auto Todo and a 0.8% negative impact from foreign currency. Net income was $8.9 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.06. Excluding the impact of restructuring and special termination costs, goodwill impairment and certain transaction costs, adjusted net income was $196.7 million, or $1.35 per diluted share. In addition, net income and adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 excludes any profit contribution from EIS. Refer to the reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income for more information.

Fourth quarter sales for the Automotive Group were up 8.7%, including an approximate 2.9% comparable sales increase, a 7.2% net benefit from acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments and unfavorable foreign currency of 1.4%. Sales for the Industrial Group were down 5.9%, including a 1.2% comparable sales decrease and a 12.3% decrease due to the sale of EIS, partially offset by a 7.6% increase from acquisitions. Sales for the Business Products Group were down 6.3%.

Paul Donahue, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, ''Our fourth quarter results were driven by total sales growth of approximately 7% excluding the impact of EIS, which we sold on September 30th. The quarter was highlighted by the continued improvement in gross margin, solid sales and operating results in our U.S. and Australasian automotive businesses and continued operating margin expansion in Industrial.'' 

Mr. Donahue added, "We also closed on the Todd automotive and Fluid Power House industrial acquisitions in the fourth quarter and, effective January 1, 2020, sold our Canadian business products operations to further strengthen our portfolio. Our team was busy executing on our growth strategy while also focused on the cost savings initiatives announced last quarter. We are in the midst of streamlining functional areas across the organization, reducing the total number of distribution facilities and implementing greater use of

automation within our facilities and back-office functions. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our targeted $100 million cost savings run-rate by the end of 2020."

Full Year 2019 Results

Sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were $19.4 billion, a 3.5% increase compared to $18.7 billion for the same period in 2018. Net income for the twelve months was $621.1 million and diluted earnings per share was $4.24. Excluding items which impact comparability with prior periods, as noted above, adjusted net income was $833.2 million, or $5.69 per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Refer to the reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income for more information.

Mr. Donahue concluded, "2019 represents the third consecutive year of record sales for Genuine Parts Company, with positive comparable sales and the benefit of several key acquisitions. We also streamlined our operations with the sale of various non-core businesses. Combined, these efforts served to further optimize our portfolio, and we expect to continue our strategic transformation in 2020. We enter the new year with plans and initiatives to drive sales and profitability, working capital improvement and significant value for all our stakeholders."

Non-GAAP Information

This release contains certain financial information not derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These items include adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. The Company believes that the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per common share, which are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's core operations. The Company considers these metrics useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of the Company’s ongoing operating performance by removing items management believes are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We believe these measures to be useful to enhance the comparability of our results from period to period and with our competitors, as well as to show ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not associated with the Company’s core operations. The Company does not, nor does it suggest investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, 

(Cont.)

or as a substitute for, GAAP financial information. The Company has included a reconciliation of this additional information to the most comparable GAAP measure following the financial statements below.

(UNAUDITED)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Notes:

•Restructuring costs and special termination costs are related to the 2019 Cost Savings Plan announced in the fourth quarter of 2019. The costs are primarily associated with severance and other employee costs, including a voluntary retirement program, and facility and closure costs related to the consolidation of operations.

•Goodwill impairment charge relates to our Business Products reporting unit. Several factors that developed in the fourth quarter of 2019 at this reporting unit led to this charge, including: (i) greater uncertainty associated with long-term industry trends and the competitive environment and (ii) fourth quarter results, including segment profitability, that were below management expectations due primarily to a reduction in volume with certain national account customers.
