 Item 7.01  

Regulation FD Disclosure.   

The information contained in the following paragraph of this Item 7.01 is being “furnished” by CenturyLink, Inc. (“we,” “us” or “our”) and shall not be deemed “filed” for the purposes of or otherwise subject to liabilities under Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into our filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, other than to the extent that such filing incorporated by reference any or all of such information by express reference thereto.  

As of January 15, 2020, we agreed to settlements of certain consumer practices claims asserted by state attorneys general, and are actively discussing potential resolutions of claims by others. While we do not agree with allegations raised in these matters, we have been willing to consider reasonable settlements where appropriate. We currently expect to take a fourth quarter 2019 special item charge of approximately $50 million with respect to these settlements and other consumer litigation related matters.

These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and are based on current expectations only, and are subject to various uncertainties, including the possibility that our claims could be more costly to resolve than currently anticipated. Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated by us in those statements.
