As previously disclosed, on January 10, 2020, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of The Boeing Company (the “Company”) determined that David L. Calhoun, President and Chief Executive Officer, would, in connection with his hiring, be eligible to receive (i) an award of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) valued at $10 million subject to a three-year vesting period (the “Supplemental RSU Award”) and (ii) an award of performance-based RSUs valued at approximately $7 million which would be earned only upon continued employment and the achievement of several key business milestones, including full safe return to service of the 737 MAX (the “Performance-Based Award” and, together with the Supplemental RSU Award, the “Awards”).  

On February 23, 2020, the Compensation Committee approved the Awards. The Supplemental RSU Award, which consists of 31,345 RSUs, and the Performance-Based Award, which consists of 21,988 RSUs, are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in The Boeing Company 2003 Incentive Plan and the relevant notice of terms.  

In addition, the Performance-Based Award is scheduled to vest, at the earliest, 50% after two years of service as CEO and 50% after three years as CEO. However, in no event will either installment of the Performance-Based Award vest unless and until all of performance goals set forth below are certified by the Compensation Committee to have been substantially achieved. If the performance goals are not substantially achieved by December 31, 2023, the Performance-Based Award will be forfeited in its entirety. The performance goals are:  

   1.  

Safe return to service of the 737 MAX, including worldwide regulatory clearance, return to commercial service of grounded 737 MAX aircraft, and delivery of 737 MAX aircraft manufactured during the grounding;   

   2.
