Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

DTE Energy Company (“DTE Energy”) will meet with investors on February 21, 2020. A copy of the slide presentation from the meetings is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and will be available on DTE Energy's website, www.dteenergy.com on February 20, 2020. The slide presentation is available on DTE Energy's website, www.dteenergy.com. In the meetings, DTE Energy reaffirms its 2020 operating earnings guidance range of $6.47-$6.75 per share.

In its slide presentation and this filing, DTE Energy discusses 2020 operating earnings guidance. It is likely that certain items that impact the company's 2020 reported results will be excluded from operating results. Reconciliations to the comparable 2020 reported earnings guidance are not provided because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of specific line items (i.e. future non-recurring items, certain mark-to-market adjustments and discontinued operations). These items may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may have a significant impact on reported earnings.

In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed “filed” for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth in such a filing.
