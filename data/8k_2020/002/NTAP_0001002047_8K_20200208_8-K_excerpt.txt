Retirement of Named Executive Officer 

On February 12, 2020, NetApp announced that Ronald J. Pasek informed the Company of his intent to retire from his position as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company by the end of the Company’s fiscal year 2020 (“Fiscal 2020”). Mr. Pasek has agreed to work with the Company and its Board of Directors (the “Board”) to ensure an orderly transition.  

On February 8, 2020, the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board approved the terms of a separation and release agreement with Mr. Pasek (the “Pasek Agreement”). The Pasek Agreement, upon becoming effective, provides for (i) release of all claims by Mr. Pasek in favor of the Company; (ii) a payment to Mr. Pasek of $626,000; and (iii) accelerated vesting of Mr. Pasek’s service-vested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) such that Mr. Pasek shall be entitled to the pro rata portion of the RSUs that would have otherwise vested in June 2020 (based on days of service during the vesting period). If Mr. Pasek remains an employee of the Company through the end of Fiscal 2020, he shall be entitled to: (i) payment of the amount earned under his Fiscal 2020 incentive compensation award in accordance with the terms and conditions approved by the Committee under the Company’s Executive Compensation Plan; and (ii) vesting of that portion of his outstanding performance-based restricted stock units (“PBRSUs”) with a performance period ending on April 24, 2020, with payout based on the actual performance of the Company relative to the metrics set forth in the grant agreement.  

On February 8, 2020, the Committee also approved the terms of a separation and release agreement with Henri Richard, (the “Richard Agreement”). As previously announced, Mr. Richard intends to retire from his position of Executive Vice President, World Wide Field and Customer Operations at the end of the Fiscal 2020. The Richard Agreement, upon becoming effective, provides for (i) release of all claims by Mr. Richard in favor of the Company; (ii) a payment to Mr. Richard of $300,000 and (iii) accelerated vesting of Mr. Richard’s RSUs such that Mr. Richard shall be entitled to the pro rata portion of the RSUs that would have otherwise vested in June 2020 (based on days of service during the vesting period). If Mr. Richard remains an employee of the Company through the end of Fiscal 2020, he shall be entitled to: (i) payment of the amount earned under his Fiscal 2020 incentive compensation award in accordance with the terms and conditions approved by the Committee under the Company’s Executive Compensation Plan and (ii) vesting of that portion of his outstanding PBRSUs with a performance period ending on April 24, 2020, based on the actual performance of the Company relative to the metrics set forth in the grant agreement. If Mr. Richard remains an employee of the Company through May 13, 2020, he is eligible for pro rata vesting of his outstanding PBRSUs in accordance with the terms of the applicable grant agreements.  

The foregoing summaries of the Pasek Agreement and the Richard Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the full text of the applicable agreement, a copy of which will be filed with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending April 24, 2020.
