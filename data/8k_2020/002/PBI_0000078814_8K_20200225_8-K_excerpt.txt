A copy of the press release announcing the results of such Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The Company has received consents from holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 3.375% Notes prior to the early tender time, which is the requisite number to amend the Indenture Documents. The proposed amendments with respect to the 3.375% Notes are being entered into pursuant to a second supplemental indenture, dated as of February 26, 2020 (the “Second Supplemental Indenture”), by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. The Second Supplemental Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

In addition, on February 25, 2020, the Company amended the terms and conditions of the Consent Solicitation described in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement dated February 10, 2020 to provide that, if any 3.375% Notes validly tendered after the early tender time and prior to the expiration time and not validly withdrawn are subject to proration, the consent related to any 3.375% Notes accepted for purchase will not be deemed null and void.

This Current Report on Form 8-K, including the press release incorporated by reference, is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of offers to buy any Notes. The Tender Offers are being made only pursuant to the offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement of the Company, dated February 10, 2020. The Tender Offers are not being made to holders of Notes in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction.
