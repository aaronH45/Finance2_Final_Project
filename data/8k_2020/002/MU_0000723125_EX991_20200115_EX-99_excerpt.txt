(Amended and Restated as of January 15, 2020)

ARTICLE I - CORPORATE OFFICES

Section 1. Registered Office.

The registered office shall be fixed in the corporation’s Certificate of Incorporation, as the same may be amended from time to time.

Section 2. Other Offices.

The corporation may also have offices at such other places both within and without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or the business of the corporation may require.

ARTICLE II - MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

Section 1. Place of Meetings.

Meetings of the stockholders shall be held at the principal office of the corporation in the City of Boise, State of Idaho, or at such other, if any, place either within or without the State of Delaware as shall be designated by the Board of Directors in the notice of the meeting.

Section 2. Annual Meeting.

Annual meetings of stockholders shall be held on such date and such hour as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting. At such meeting, the stockholders shall elect a Board of Directors and transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.

Section 3. Notice of Stockholder Meeting.

Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a notice of the meeting shall be given that shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (if such date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting), and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the written notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting.

Section 4. List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote.

The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (provided, however, if the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be examined by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any 

1

stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list of stockholders required by this Article II, Section 4 or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

Section 5. Special Meetings.

(a) Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, may be called by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or by the Secretary at the request of holders of shares entitled to cast not less than twenty percent (20%) of the votes at the meeting. A request to the Secretary shall be signed by each stockholder, or a duly authorized agent of such stockholder, requesting the special meeting and shall set forth, for each stockholder requesting the meeting, the information required to be in a stockholder’s notice pursuant to Section 11(b) or Section 11(c) of this Article II, as applicable. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. Any special meeting shall be held not more than ninety (90) days after a proper request to call the special meeting is received by the Secretary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a special meeting requested by stockholders shall not be held if (a) the business proposed to be brought before the special meeting by stockholders is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law or (b) the Board of Directors has called or calls for an annual meeting of stockholders to be held within ninety (90) days after the Secretary receives the request for the special meeting and the Board of Directors determines in good faith that the business of such annual meeting includes (among any other matters properly brought before the annual meeting) the business specified in the request. A stockholder may revoke a request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary, and if, following such revocation, there are un-revoked requests from stockholders holding in the aggregate less than the requisite number of shares entitling the stockholders to request the calling of a special meeting, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may cancel the special meeting.

(b) Business transacted at a special meeting requested by stockholders shall be limited to the matters described in the request for the special meeting; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit the Board of Directors from submitting additional matters to stockholders at any such special meeting.

Section 6. Quorum.

The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy thereat may, by a majority in voting power thereof, adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided by this Article II until a quorum shall be present or represented.

Section 7. Adjourned Meeting Notice.

Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such reconvened meeting if the time, place, if any, and means of remote communications are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the reconvened meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, a notice of the reconvened meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the reconvened meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such reconvened meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the reconvened meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record date so fixed for notice of such reconvened meeting.

Section 8. Proxies.

Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any issue brought before such meeting, unless the issue is (a) one upon which by express provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the corporation 

2

or its securities, a different vote is required in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of the issue or (b) relates to the election of directors, in which case the provisions of Article III, Section 2 shall apply.

Section 9. Reserved.

Section 10. Action by Written Consent.

(a) Notice.  Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer of agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which minutes of proceedings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the corporation’s registered office shall be by hand or certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall, to the extent required by law, be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the corporation.

(b) Record Date. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, in order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request that the Board of Directors fix a record date for such purpose. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such written notice is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Article II, Section 10(b)). If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Article II, Section 10(b) or otherwise within ten (10) days after the date on which such written notice is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date after the expiration of such ten (10) day time period on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which minutes of proceedings of stockholders are recorded. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

(c) Inspector of Elections. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by this Article II, Section 10 and applicable law, to the corporation of a written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the corporation shall engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of such consents and/or revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent and without a meeting shall be effective until such inspectors have completed their review, determined that the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents delivered to the corporation in accordance with this Article II, Section 10 and applicable law have been obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents, and certified such determination for entry in the records of the corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders. Nothing contained in this Article II, Section 10(c) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).

(d) Effective Date. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days after the earliest dated written consent delivered in the manner prescribed in this Article II, Section 10 to the corporation, written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed in this Article II, Section 10 and applicable law, and not revoked.

Section 11. Advance Notice of Stockholder Nominees, Proxy Access and Stockholder Business.

(a) At a meeting of the stockholders, only such nominations of persons for the election of directors and such other business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, nominations or such other business must be:

(i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof,

(ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, or

In addition, any proposal of business (other than the nomination of persons for election to the Board of Directors) must be a proper matter for stockholder action. For business (including, but not limited to, director nominations) to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder or stockholders of record intending to propose the business must have given timely notice thereof pursuant to this Article II, Section 11(a) or Section 11(c) below, as applicable, in writing to the Secretary even if such matter is already the subject of any notice to the stockholders or public disclosure by the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive office of the corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of the date of the corporation's proxy statement released to stockholders in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year’s proxy statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received a reasonable time before the solicitation is made.

Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary in accordance with the provisions of Article II, Section 11(a). For the nomination of any person or persons for election to the Board of Directors by any stockholder, whether at an annual meeting or a properly called special meeting of stockholders, the stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth:

(i) the name, age, business address and residence address of each nominee proposed in such notice,

(ii) the principal occupation or employment of each such nominee,

(iii) (A) the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which are owned of record and beneficially by each such nominee and any affiliates or associates of such nominee (if any) and (B) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding of the type described in clause (vi) (D) of this section, but as it relates to each such nominee rather than the stockholder,

(iv) (A) if any such nominee is a party to any direct or indirect compensatory, reimbursement, indemnification, payment or other financial agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the corporation (a “Compensation Arrangement”), or has received, directly or indirectly, any compensation or other payment from any person or entity other than the corporation, in each case in connection with candidacy or service as a director of the corporation, a detailed description of such agreement, arrangement or understanding and its terms and any such compensation received and (B) such other information concerning each such nominee as would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of such nominee as a director in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved) or that is otherwise required to be disclosed, under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Exchange Act”),

4

(v) the consent of the nominee to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected and a representation by the nominee to the effect that the nominee has read and, if elected will agree to adhere to the corporation’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, corporate Governance Guidelines, and any conflict of interest, confidentiality and stock ownership and securities trading policies, and any other policies and guidelines of the Board or the corporation applicable to directors, as well as any applicable law, rule or regulation or listing requirement, and

(vi) as to the proposing stockholder: (A) the name and address of the stockholder as they appear on the corporation's books and of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made, (B) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are owned by the proposing stockholder (beneficially and of record) and owned by the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made, as of the date of the proposing stockholder's notice, (C) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to such nomination between or among the proposing stockholder and any of its affiliates or associates, and any others (including their names) acting in concert with any of the foregoing, (D) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of the proposing stockholder's notice by, or on behalf of, the proposing stockholder or any of its affiliates or associates, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of the proposing stockholder or any of its affiliates or associates with respect to shares of stock of the corporation, (E) a representation that the proposing stockholder is a holder of record of shares of the corporation entitled to vote at the meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice, (F) a representation whether the proposing stockholder intends to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve the election of the nominee and/or otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such election and (G) and, with respect to (B), (C) and (D) above, a representation that the proposing stockholder will promptly notify the corporation in writing of the same as of the record date for the meeting promptly following the later of the record date or the date notice of the record date is first publicly disclosed

The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.

(c) (i) Subject to the requirements of Article II, Section 11, the corporation shall include in its proxy statement and on its proxy card for any annual meeting of stockholders the name of any director nominee proposed by a stockholder for election to the Board of Directors who is properly submitted pursuant to this Article II, Section 11(c) (each a “Proxy Access Nominee”) provided that (A) timely written notice of such Proxy Access Nominee satisfying this Article II, Section 11(c) (“Proxy Access Nomination Notice”) is delivered to the corporation by or on behalf of a stockholder or group of stockholders that, at the time the Proxy Access Nomination Notice is delivered, satisfy the ownership and other requirements of this Article II, Section 11(c) (such stockholder or stockholders, and any person on whose behalf they are acting, the “Eligible Stockholder”), (B) the Eligible Stockholder expressly elects in writing at the time of providing the Proxy Access Nomination Notice to have its nominee included in the corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to this Article II, Section 11(c), and (C) the Eligible Stockholder and the Proxy Access Nominee otherwise satisfy the requirements of this Article II, Section 11(c) and the criteria for membership on the Board of Directors set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines for the corporation or other document(s) setting forth qualifications for directors (the “Board Qualifications”).

(ii) To be timely, the Proxy Access Nomination Notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive office of the corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days nor earlier than one hundred fifty (150) calendar days in advance of the date of the corporation's proxy statement released to stockholders in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year’s proxy statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received a reasonable time before the solicitation is made. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting of stockholders commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the submission of such Proxy Access Nomination.

(iii) In addition to including the name of the Proxy Access Nominee in the corporation’s proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders, the corporation also shall include (A) the information concerning the Proxy Access Nominee and the Eligible Stockholder that is required to be disclosed in the corporation’s proxy statement pursuant to the proxy 

5

rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and (B) a Statement (defined below) (collectively, the “Required Information”). To be timely, the Required Information must be received by the Secretary at the principal office of the corporation within the time period specified in Article II, Section 11(c)(ii). Nothing in this Article II, Section 11(c) shall limit the corporation’s ability to solicit against and include in its proxy statement its own statements relating to any Proxy Access Nominee.

(iv) The maximum number of Stockholder Nominees nominated by all Eligible Stockholders that will be included in the corporation’s proxy materials with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders shall not exceed the greater of (A) two (2) and (B) 20 % of the total number of directors in office (rounded down to the nearest whole number), as of the last day on which a Proxy Access Notice may be delivered pursuant to and in accordance with this Article II, Section 11(v) (the “Permitted Number”); provided, however, the Permitted Number shall be reduced (but not below one) by:

(A) the number of individuals who will be included in the corporation’s proxy materials as nominees of the Board of Directors pursuant to an agreement, arrangement or other understanding with a stockholder or group of stockholders (other than any such agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with an acquisition of stock of the Corporation by such stockholder or group of stockholders from the Corporation), other than any such director who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the Board of Directors, for at least two (2) annual terms;

(B) the number of directors currently in office that will be included in the corporation’s proxy materials as nominees of the Board of Directors who were previously Proxy Access Nominees elected to the Board of Directors pursuant to this Article II, Section 11(c), other than any such director who at the time of such annual meeting will have served as a director continuously, as a nominee of the Board of Directors, for at least two (2) annual terms.

For purposes of determining when the Permitted Number has been reached, any individual nominated by an Eligible Stockholder for inclusion in the Corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this Article II, Section 11(c) whose nomination is subsequently withdrawn or whom the Board of Directors decides to nominate for election to the Board of Directors shall be counted as one of the Stockholder Nominees. In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs after the deadline for delivery of Proxy Access Notice but before the date of the annual meeting and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors in connection therewith, the Permitted Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced.

Any Eligible Stockholder submitting more than one Stockholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation’s proxy materials pursuant to this Article II, Section 11(c) shall rank such Stockholder Nominees based on the order that the Eligible Stockholder desires such Stockholder Nominees to be selected for inclusion in the Corporation’s proxy materials. In the event that the number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Stockholders pursuant to this Article II, Section 11(c) exceeds the Permitted Number, the highest ranking Stockholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Article II, Section 11(c) of each Eligible Stockholder will be selected for inclusion in the Corporation’s proxy materials until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of the Corporation’s outstanding common stock each Eligible Stockholder disclosed as owned (as defined below) in its respective Proxy Access Notice submitted to the Corporation. If the Permitted Number is not reached after the highest ranking Stockholder Nominee who meets the requirements of this Article II, Section 11(c) from each Eligible Stockholder has been selected, this process will continue with the next highest ranked nominees as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached.

(v) An Eligible Stockholder must have owned (as defined below) continuously for at least three years a number of shares that represents three percent (3%) or more of the total voting power of the corporation’s outstanding shares entitled to vote in the election of directors as of the most recent date prior to the submission of the Proxy Access Nomination Notice for which such amount is given in any filing by the corporation with the SEC (the “Required Shares”) as of both the date the Proxy Access Nomination Notice is received by the corporation in accordance with this Article II, Section 11(c) and the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting of stockholders and must continue to own the Required Shares through the meeting date. For purposes of satisfying the ownership requirement under this Article II, Section 11(c), the voting power represented by the shares of the corporation owned by one or more stockholders, or by the person or persons who own shares of the corporation and on whose behalf any stockholder is acting, may be aggregated, provided that the number of stockholders and other persons whose ownership of shares is aggregated for such purpose shall not exceed twenty (20), and a group of two or more funds that are (A) under common management and investment control, (B) under common management and funded primarily by the same employer (or by a group of related employers that are under common control), or (C) a “group of investment companies,” as such term is defined in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, shall be treated as one stockholder or person for this purpose. With respect to any annual meeting of stockholders, no person may be a member of more than one group of persons constituting an Eligible Stockholder under this Article II, Section 11(c).

6

 For purposes of this Article II, Section 11(c), an Eligible Stockholder shall be deemed to “own” only those outstanding shares of the corporation as to which the person possesses both (A) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (B) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares; provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) shall not include any shares (1) sold by such person or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (2) borrowed by such person or any of its affiliates for any purposes or purchased by such person or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell, or (3) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such person or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of the corporation’s outstanding shares, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such person’s or affiliates’ full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares and/or hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such person or affiliate. A person shall “own” shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the person retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A person’s ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the person has loaned such shares, provided that the person has the power to recall such loaned shares on five business days’ notice and provides a representation that it will promptly recall such loaned shares upon being notified that any of its Proxy Access Nominees will be included in the corporation’s proxy statement, or the person has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the person. The terms “owned,” “owning,” and other variations of the word “own” shall have correlative meanings. For purposes of this Article II, Section 11(c), the term “affiliate” shall have the meaning ascribed thereto pursuant to the proxy rules of the Exchange Act.

(vi) Within the time period specified in Article II, Section 11(c)(ii) for the Proxy Access Nomination Notice, an Eligible Stockholder must provide in writing to the Secretary, with respect to the Stockholder Nominee, in addition to the information and representations required to be provided in the stockholder’s notice pursuant to Article II, Section 11(b), representations and agreements that such person: (A) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how such person, if elected as a director of the corporation, will act or vote on any issue or question (a “Voting Commitment”) that has not been disclosed to the corporation, and (B) is not and will not become a party to a Compensation Arrangement in connection with such person’s nomination for director and/or service as a director, that has not been disclosed to the corporation. At the request of the corporation, the Proxy Access Nominee must complete, sign and submit all questionnaires required of the Board of Directors within five business days of receipt of each such questionnaire from the corporation and provide within five business days of the corporation’s request such additional information as the corporation determines may be necessary to permit the Board of Directors to determine whether such Proxy Access Nominee meets the requirements of this Article II, Section 11(c) and/or satisfies the Board Qualifications, including whether: (1) such Proxy Access Nominee is independent under the listing standards of each principal U.S. exchange upon which the corporation’s shares are listed, any applicable rules of the SEC, and any publicly disclosed standards used by the Board of Directors in determining and disclosing the independence of members of the Board of Directors (the “Independence Standards”), (2) such Proxy Access Nominee has any direct or indirect relationship with the corporation, and (3) such Proxy Access Nominee is not and has not been subject to any event specified in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, or any order of the type specified in Rule 506(d) of Regulation D under the Securities Act.

The authorized number of directors of the corporation shall be seven.

Section 2. Election of Directors.

The directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders, but if any such annual meeting is not held, or the directors are not elected thereat, the directors may be elected at any special meeting of the stockholders held for that purpose.

The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate or certificates of stock or uncertificated shares to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the corporation, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit to that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates of stock or uncertificated shares, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or such owner’s legal representative, to give the corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 4. Transfer of Stock.

Transfer of shares of stock of the corporation shall be made only on the transfer books of the corporation upon authorization by the registered holder thereof or by such holder’s attorney thereunto authorized by a power of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary or a transfer agent of such stock, and if such shares are represented by a certificate, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates for such shares properly endorsed or accompanied by a duly executed stock transfer power and payment of any taxes thereon; provided however, that the corporation shall be entitled to recognize any lawful restriction on transfer.

Section 5. Record Date.

(a) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the reconvened meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such reconvened meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the reconvened meeting.

(b) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action (other than action by consent in writing without a meeting), the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such other action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose (other than action by consent in writing without a meeting) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

Section 6. Registered Stockholders.

The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.

ARTICLE VII - FORUM FOR DISPUTES

Section 1. Forum for Disputes.

(a) Unless the corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the corporation to the corporation or the corporation’s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.

(b) If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of Article VII, Section 1(a) above is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a “Foreign Action”) in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce Article VII, Section 1(a) above (an “FSC Enforcement Action”) and (ii) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such FSC Enforcement Action by service upon such stockholder’s counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

(c) Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the corporation irreparable harm and the corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions.

(d) Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article VII Section 2.
