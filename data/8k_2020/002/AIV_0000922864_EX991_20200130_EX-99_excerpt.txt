Aimco Reports Fourth Quarter 2019 Results; Establishes 2020 Guidance 

Denver, Colorado, January 30, 2020 – Apartment Investment and Management Company (“Aimco”) (NYSE: AIV) announced today fourth quarter results for 2019. 

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine comments: “Aimco had a solid fourth quarter, completing a good year. Full year 2019 Same Store revenue and NOI were 50 and 70 basis points, respectively, better than the original midpoint of guidance, and controllable operating expenses were flat, year-over-year. With December average daily occupancy of 97.9%, our properties are well occupied, providing an excellent starting point to 2020.” 

“In redevelopment, Aimco continued to upgrade properties throughout its portfolio and is ‘on track’ with its major projects in Boulder, Miami Beach, and Redwood City.” 

“In portfolio management, we continue to search for accretive investment opportunities in fully-priced markets. In fourth quarter, we closed one such investment, making a mezzanine loan to the partnership that owns Parkmerced Apartments in San Francisco while acquiring a ten-year option to acquire a 30% interest in the partnership which owns both 3,165 rent-control apartment homes and entitled land to develop 4,093 market rate apartment homes. The option provides Aimco with the risk-free opportunity to participate in one of the most dynamic multi-family markets in the world, while the loan provides a safe and immediately accretive return on investment.” 

Chief Financial Officer Paul Beldin adds: “Fourth quarter 2019 Pro forma FFO of $0.65 per share was $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of guidance primarily from (i) better than anticipated Same Store operations and (ii) the earnings contribution from the Parkmerced loan. AFFO per share of $0.58 met the midpoint of guidance with increased investment in maintaining our properties offsetting the outperformance in Pro forma FFO.”  

“In 2020, we expect Same Store revenue growth of 3.0% to 3.8%, and Same Store expense growth of 1.6% to 2.4%, resulting in Same Store NOI growth of 3.2% to 4.6%. At their midpoints, these expectations are consistent with our 2020 Outlook, published on September 30, 2019. We also expect 2020 Aimco AFFO per share to be $2.34 to $2.44, representing 9% growth at the midpoint, consistent with our December forecast of 8% to 10% 2020 AFFO growth.” 

Financial Results: Fourth Quarter Pro forma FFO & AFFO Per Share grew by 5% & 12%, respectively 

In July 2018, Aimco sold its Asset Management business, accepting near-term earnings dilution as the price of an increased long-term growth rate. In 2019, Aimco overcame the resulting earnings headwinds to achieve 2% Pro forma FFO and AFFO per share growth. In the fourth quarter, the first without the year-over-year comparison including the Asset Management business, Aimco Pro forma FFO and AFFO per share increased at 5% and 12%, respectively.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

* See Supplemental Schedule 1 for a detailed list of Pro forma adjustments to FFO. 

2 

Net Income (per diluted common share) – Year-over-year, fourth quarter net income increased due primarily to higher gains from dispositions. 

Pro forma FFO (per pro forma diluted common share) – Aimco’s fourth quarter Pro forma FFO per share increased $0.03 year-over-year due primarily to a $0.02 contribution from Same Store Property Net Operating Income, driven by a 3.3% increase in revenue, offset partially by a 4.4% increase in expenses, resulting in growth of 2.9%. 

Adjusted Funds from Operations (per pro forma diluted common share) – Aimco’s fourth quarter AFFO per share increased $0.06 year-over-year due to the $0.03 increase in Pro forma FFO per share and $0.03 due to timing of Capital Replacement spending in 2018.  

Operating Results: Same Store NOI: Fourth Quarter Up 2.9%; Full Year Up 4.3% 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Same Store Rental Rates – Aimco measures changes in rental rates by comparing, on a lease-by-lease basis, the rate on a newly executed lease to the rate on the expiring lease for that same apartment. Newly executed leases are classified as either a new lease, where a vacant apartment is leased to a new customer, or as a renewal. The table below details changes in new and renewal lease rates. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

New leases were approximately 75% of Aimco total leasing activity in November and December, contributing to a 50 basis point increase in occupancy during these months. 

3 

Redevelopment and Development  

Redevelopment is Aimco’s second line of business where Aimco creates value by repositioning communities within the Aimco portfolio. Aimco also undertakes ground-up development when warranted by risk-adjusted investment returns, either directly or in connection with redevelopment of an existing apartment community. Aimco invests to earn leverage-neutral risk-adjusted returns in excess of those expected from the apartment communities sold in “paired trades” to fund the redevelopment and development. Of these two activities, Aimco generally favors redevelopment because it permits adjustment of the scope and timing of spending to align with changing market conditions and customer preferences. 

During the fourth quarter, Aimco invested $58 million in redevelopment and development. Aimco continued phased redevelopment activities at Bay Parc in Miami, the full redevelopment of the North Tower at Flamingo Point in Miami Beach, Florida, and 707 Leahy in Redwood City, California, and ground-up construction at Parc Mosaic in Boulder, Colorado, The Fremont on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado, and Eldridge Townhomes adjacent to its Elm Creek apartment community in Elmhurst, Illinois. 

At Parc Mosaic, Aimco completed three buildings in 2019, the first in August, the second in October, and the third in late December. As of December 31, 2019, the first two buildings were 81% leased and in January, Aimco welcomed the first residents of the third building. The fourth, and final, building was delayed slightly and is now expected to be finished later in the first quarter. Notwithstanding this delay, Aimco expects to achieve stabilized occupancy in fourth quarter 2020, consistent with prior projections. 

At 707 Leahy, Aimco completed construction on the first building, containing twelve apartment homes, in January. Construction on the remaining homes is on schedule to be complete in the second quarter. 

At Flamingo Point, Aimco completed construction on the entryway, retail, and amenities in the fourth quarter and continued the full renovation of the North Tower. 

When possible, Aimco prefers redevelopments that can be completed one apartment home at a time, when that home is vacated and available for renovation, or one floor at a time, thereby limiting the number of down homes and lease-up risk. Aimco currently has six smaller phase projects ongoing in its portfolio. During the fourth quarter, Aimco completed 21 apartment homes, with another 21 homes under construction at quarter end. In 2019, at these projects, Aimco completed 150 apartment homes. 

During the fourth quarter, Aimco leased 77 redeveloped or newly developed apartment homes. At December 31, 2019, Aimco’s exposure to lease-up at active redevelopments and developments was 866 apartment homes, or less than 3% of Aimco’s homes.    

Portfolio Management 

Aimco’s portfolio of apartment communities is diversified across “A,” “B,” and “C+” price points, averaging “B/B+” in quality and is also diversified across several of the largest markets in the United States. 

As part of its portfolio strategy, Aimco seeks to sell up to 10% of its portfolio annually and to reinvest the proceeds from such sales in accretive uses such as capital enhancements, redevelopments, some developments, and selective acquisitions with projected Free Cash Flow internal rates of return higher than expected from the communities being sold. Through this disciplined approach to capital recycling, Aimco significantly increases the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio. 

4 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Fourth Quarter Portfolio – For its entire portfolio, Aimco’s average monthly revenue per apartment home was $2,272 for fourth quarter 2019, a 7% increase compared to fourth quarter 2018. This increase is due to year-over-year growth in Same Store revenue, as well as Aimco’s acquisition activities, lease-up of redevelopment communities, and sales of communities with average monthly revenues per apartment home lower than those of the retained portfolio. 

In 2019, Aimco reallocated capital from slower-growth markets such as Chicago and reinvested the proceeds in higher-growth markets such as Miami, Denver, and Boston. 

Acquisitions – Aimco follows a disciplined paired trade policy in making investments. Aimco evaluates potential acquisitions seeking Free Cash Flow internal rates of returns higher than those of the properties being sold. Aimco prefers well-located real estate where land is a significant percentage of total value and provides potential upside from development or redevelopment. 

In 2019, Aimco acquired three properties: One Ardmore in Ardmore, Pennsylvania; Prism (50 Rogers), under construction in Cambridge, Massachusetts; and 1001 Brickell Bay Drive in Miami, Florida. Together, these acquisitions have an expected 9% weighted-average Free Cash Flow internal rate of return, approximately 300 basis points better than expected from the properties being sold in paired trades to fund the acquisitions. 

Mezzanine Loan Investment – As announced in December 2019, Aimco made a five-year, $275 million mezzanine loan at a 10% annual rate to the partnership owning Parkmerced Apartments. The loan is secured by a second-priority deed of trust. Aimco simultaneously acquired a ten-year option to acquire a 30% interest in the partnership at an exercise price of $1 million, increased by 30% of future capital spending to progress development and redevelopment of Parkmerced Apartments. 

Parkmerced Apartments is a 152-acre site in the southwest corner of San Francisco, currently improved with 3,221 apartment homes completed shortly before and after World War II. These apartment homes are subject to City of San Francisco rent control. The development of the site is governed by a development agreement that allows for 8,900 total residential units, with the new units exempt from City of San Francisco rent control. The partnership, which is the Aimco borrower and in which Aimco has the option to acquire 30% ownership, owns 3,165 of the existing rent-controlled apartment homes as well as the vested right to develop 4,093 of the new market-rate homes.  

Dispositions – In the fourth quarter, Aimco sold four apartment communities with 991 apartment homes, generating net proceeds of $201 million.  

In 2019, Aimco sold twelve apartment communities, generating net proceeds of $619 million used to fund acquisitions, redevelopment, development, the repurchase of Aimco shares in the fourth quarter of 2018, and other capital investments. Aimco delayed approximately $300 million of year-end and January sales. While this delay temporarily increased leverage, we expect a better execution as the transaction market remains deep, liquid, and attractively priced.

Balance Sheet 

Aimco Leverage 

Aimco seeks to increase financial returns by using leverage with appropriate caution. Aimco limits risk through its balance sheet structure, employing low leverage, primarily non-recourse and long-dated property debt; and Aimco builds financial flexibility by maintaining ample unused and available credit as well as holding properties with substantial value unencumbered by property debt; and by using partners’ equity capital when it enhances financial returns or reduces investment risk. 

Aimco leverage includes the Aimco share of long-term, non-recourse, property debt encumbering apartment communities, outstanding borrowings under the Aimco revolving credit facility, outstanding Preferred Equity, and redeemable noncontrolling interests in a real estate partnership. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

*  

Aimco Preferred Equity is redeemable at the holder’s option. Aimco has computed the weighted-average maturity of its total leverage assuming a 10-year maturity for its Preferred Equity. 

**  

During the year ended December 31, 2019, Aimco acquired a 95% interest in 1001 Brickell Bay Drive. The remaining 5% is held by an outside partner with a put option that allows the holder, at his option, to redeem his interest for cash after a three-year period. The term to maturity reflects the time remaining until the put expires. 

During the fourth quarter, Aimco borrowed $105 million in a non-recourse, fixed-rate property loan with interest at 3.21% and a term to maturity of 11 years. 

Leverage Ratios 

Aimco target leverage ratios are Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDAre below 7.0x and Adjusted EBITDAre to Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends greater than 2.5x. Aimco calculates Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Interest Expense used in its leverage ratios based on current quarter amounts, annualized. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The sales delay mentioned above, increased Aimco leverage to EBITDAre ratios by 0.3x at year end 2019. Aimco expects a gradual decline in leverage to EBITDAre ratios throughout 2020, reaching approximately 6.4x and 6.5x, respectively, at year-end. In future years, earnings growth from completed redevelopments will increase EBITDAre and further reduce Aimco leverage ratios.  

6 

Liquidity 

Aimco uses its credit facility primarily for working capital and other short-term purposes and to secure letters of credit. At December 31, 2019, Aimco held cash and restricted cash of $177 million and had the capacity to borrow up to $518 million under its revolving credit facility, after consideration of $7 million of letters of credit backed by the facility. 

Aimco also manages its financial flexibility by maintaining an investment grade rating and holding apartment communities that are unencumbered by property debt. At December 31, 2019, Aimco held unencumbered apartment communities with an estimated fair market value of approximately $2.4 billion. 

Equity Capital Activities 

On January 28, 2020, the Aimco Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.41 per share of Class A Common Stock, representing an increase of 5% compared to the regular quarterly dividends paid in 2019. This amount is payable on February 28, 2020, to stockholders of record on February 14, 2020. 

2020 Outlook 

The Aimco strategy remains unchanged: focusing on excellence in property operations; value creation through redevelopment and development; portfolio management based on a disciplined approach to capital recycling; a safe, flexible balance sheet with abundant liquidity; and a business model favoring sustainable long-term growth executed by a stable, performance-oriented, and collaborative team.  

Aimco expects 2020 Pro forma FFO per share in the range of $2.62 to $2.72 with AFFO per share of $2.34 to $2.44. At the guidance range midpoint, Aimco projected 2020 AFFO growth of $0.19, or 9% reflects: 

•  

$0.13 per share growth from its Same Store portfolio, based on the first quarter 2020 population; 

•  

$0.05 per share net contribution from its investments, resulting from: 

o  

$0.06 net contribution from the Parkmerced mezzanine loan,  

o  

$0.04 incremental AFFO from Redevelopment and Development communities, and 

o  

($0.05) dilution from property sales funding Redevelopment and Development and other Aimco investments in real estate; and  

•  

$0.01 per share contribution from other items, net.  

The $0.04 contribution from Redevelopment and Development communities is expected to increase another $0.18 per share, net of incremental capital costs, as these properties are stabilized over the next four years.

Aimco does not predict or guide to acquisitions. Aimco monitors potential transactions and funds acquisitions pursuant to its strict paired trade discipline. 

[4]  

Aimco delayed $300 million of year-end and January sales. The sales delay increased Aimco leverage to EBITDAre ratios by 0.3x at year end 2019. Aimco expects a gradual decline in leverage to EBITDAre ratios throughout 2020, reaching approximately 6.4x and 6.5x, respectively, at year-end. In future years, earnings growth from completed redevelopments will increase EBITDAre and further reduce Aimco leverage ratios.

Forward-looking Statements 

This Earnings Release and Supplemental Information contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, without limitation, statements regarding projected results and specifically forecasts of first quarter and full year 2020 results, including but not limited to: Nareit FFO, Pro forma FFO and selected components thereof; AFFO; Aimco redevelopment and development investments and projected yield on such investments, timelines, and Net Operating Income contribution; expectations regarding sales of Aimco apartment communities and the use of proceeds thereof; and Aimco liquidity and leverage metrics. 

These forward-looking statements are based on management’s judgment as of this date, which is subject to risks and uncertainties. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: Aimco’s ability to maintain current or meet projected occupancy, rental rate and property operating results; the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments and developments; Aimco’s ability to meet budgeted costs and timelines, and achieve budgeted rental rates related to Aimco redevelopment and development investments; expectations regarding Aimco sales of apartment communities and the use of proceeds thereof; and Aimco’s ability to comply with debt covenants, including financial coverage ratios. 

Actual results may differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements and, in addition, will be affected by a variety of risks and factors, some of which are beyond Aimco’s control, including, without limitation: 

•   

Real estate and operating risks, including fluctuations in real estate values and the general economic climate in the markets in which Aimco operates and competition for residents in such markets; national and local economic conditions, including the pace of job growth and the level of unemployment; the amount, location and quality of competitive new housing supply; the timing of acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments and developments; and changes in operating costs, including energy costs; 

•   

Financing risks, including the availability and cost of capital markets’ financing; the risk that cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; and the risk that earnings may not be sufficient to maintain compliance with debt covenants;

Insurance risks, including the cost of insurance, and natural disasters and severe weather such as hurricanes; and 

•   

Legal and regulatory risks, including costs associated with prosecuting or defending claims and any adverse outcomes; the terms of governmental regulations that affect Aimco and interpretations of those regulations; and possible environmental liabilities, including costs, fines or penalties that may be incurred due to necessary remediation of contamination of apartment communities presently or previously owned by Aimco.  

In addition, Aimco’s current and continuing qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and depends on Aimco’s ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, through actual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. 

Readers should carefully review Aimco’s financial statements and the notes thereto, as well as the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Aimco’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the other documents Aimco files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

These forward-looking statements reflect management’s judgment as of this date, and Aimco assumes no obligation to revise or update them to reflect future events or circumstances. This press release does not constitute an offer of securities for sale.

Aimco believes that Economic Income (defined as Net Asset Value, or NAV, growth plus dividends) is an important measure of long-term financial performance. NAV is used by many investors because the value of company assets can be readily estimated, even for non-earning assets such as land or properties under development. NAV has the advantage of incorporating the investment decisions of thousands of real estate investors, enhancing comparability among companies that have differences in their accounting, and avoiding disparity that can result from application of GAAP to investment properties and various ownership structures. Some investors focus on multiples of AFFO and FFO. Aimco’s disclosure of AFFO and FFO complements its focus on Economic Income.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, income tax adjustments related to gain on dispositions and other items primarily included tax on the gain on sale of apartment communities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, income tax adjustments related to gain on dispositions and other items included tax on the gain on the sale of the Asset Management business, as well as tax on the gain on the sale of apartment communities during the year ended December 31, 2018. 

[2]  

As a result of refinancing activity in 2019 and 2018, Aimco incurred debt extinguishment costs. Aimco excluded such costs from Pro forma FFO because it believes these costs are not representative of ongoing operating performance. 

[3]  

In 2018, Aimco assumed a 99-year ground lease with scheduled rent increases. Due to the terms of the lease, GAAP rent expense will exceed cash rent payments until 2076. Aimco includes the cash rent payments for this ground lease in Pro forma FFO but excludes the incremental straight-line non-cash rent expense. The rent expense for this lease is included in other expenses (income), net, on Aimco’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

[4]  

On May 16, 2019, Aimco redeemed its Class A Perpetual Preferred Stock. Aimco excluded the redemption-related amounts from Pro forma FFO because it believes these costs are not representative of operating performance. 

[5]  

During the fourth quarter 2019, Aimco incurred casualty losses due to storm-related flooding in downtown Boston that caused damage to its One Canal apartment community. Aimco excluded these costs from Pro forma FFO because of the unusual nature of the weather event that caused the loss. 

[6]  

In 2019, Aimco incurred severance and restructuring costs in connection with the closure and relocation of its office functions from its Greenville and Indianapolis offices to Denver. Aimco also incurred severance and restructuring costs in connection with the sale of its Asset Management business in 2018. Aimco excluded such costs from Pro forma FFO because it believes these costs are not representative of operating performance. 

[7]  

During 2018, Aimco was engaged in litigation with Airbnb, which was resolved in December 2018. Due to the unpredictable nature of these proceedings, related amounts recognized, net of income tax effect, are excluded from Pro forma FFO. These costs are included in other expenses (income), net, on Aimco’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

[8]  

Due to the sale of the Asset Management business in 2018, Aimco determined that a valuation allowance was no longer necessary. Aimco excluded the effect of the establishment of the valuation allowance from Pro forma FFO and as such excluded the benefit from its release. 

[9]  

Effective January 1, 2019, Aimco adopted accounting guidance that changed how Aimco recognizes costs incurred to obtain resident leases. For comparability of Pro forma FFO between periods, Aimco has recast 2018 as if the new standard was effective January 1, 2018. AFFO, which Aimco uses to measure profitability, is unchanged by the new standard. 

[10]  

In connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017, Aimco recognized income tax benefit in 2017 and adjusted the estimated impact of tax reform upon the conclusion of its analysis of the effects during 2018. Aimco excluded such amounts from Pro forma FFO because it believes these costs are not representative of operating performance. 

[11]  

During the first quarter 2019, Aimco completed a reverse stock split and a special dividend paid primarily in stock. For stock splits, GAAP requires the restatement of weighted average shares as if the reverse stock split occurred at the beginning of the period presented; while shares issued in the special dividend are included in weighted average shares outstanding from the date issued. To minimize confusion and facilitate comparison of period-over-period Pro forma FFO and AFFO, Aimco calculated pro forma weighted average shares during the year ended December 31, 2019, based on the effective date of the reverse stock split and ex-dividend date for the shares issued in the special dividend, thereby eliminating the per share impact of the GAAP treatment to Aimco’s reported Pro forma FFO and AFFO.

Aimco’s Preferred Equity is redeemable at the holder’s option. For illustrative purposes, Aimco has computed the weighted average maturity of its total leverage assuming a 10-year maturity for its Preferred Equity. 

[2]  

During the year ended December 31, 2019, Aimco acquired a 95% interest in 1001 Brickell Bay Drive. The remaining 5% is held by an outside partner with a put option that allows the holder, at his option, to redeem his interest for cash after a three-year period. The term to maturity reflects the time remaining until the put option expires. 

[3]  

In 2011, $673.8 million of Aimco’s loans payable were securitized in a trust holding only these loans. Aimco purchased the subordinate positions in the trust that holds these loans for $51.5 million. These investments have a face value of $100.9 million and a carrying amount of $94.3 million and are included in other assets on Aimco’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019. The amount of these investments effectively reduces Aimco’s leverage.

Apartment Community Capital Additions Information 

Three Months and Year Ended December 31, 2019  

(consolidated amounts in thousands, except per apartment home data) (unaudited) 

Aimco classifies capital additions as Capital Replacements (“CR”), Capital Improvements (“CI”), Capital Enhancements (“CE”), Redevelopment, Development, Initial Capital Expenditures (“ICE”), or Casualty. Recurring capital additions are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the item under consideration and the period over which Aimco has owned the item. Under this method of classification, CR represents the portion of the item consumed during Aimco’s ownership of the item, while CI represents the portion of the item consumed prior to Aimco’s period of ownership.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(Page 1 of 4)   

As of December 31, 2019 

(dollars in millions, except per home information) (unaudited) 

Aimco executes redevelopments using a range of approaches. Aimco prefers to limit risk by executing redevelopments using a phased approach, in which it renovates an apartment community in stages. Smaller phases provide Aimco the flexibility to maximize current earnings while aligning the timing of the completed apartment homes with market demand. The following table summarizes value-creating investments related to redevelopments of this nature. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Aimco undertakes ground-up development when warranted by risk-adjusted investment returns, either directly in connection with the redevelopment of an existing apartment community or, on a more limited basis, at a new location. When smaller redevelopment phases are not possible, Aimco may engage in redevelopment activities where an entire building or community is vacated. 

The following table summarizes value-creating investments related to these developments and redevelopments.

Occupancy stabilized communities includes 88th St. Second Avenue, a 43-home community in New York City, New York, Villas at Park La Brea, a 250-home community in Los Angeles, California, and Park Towne Place, a 940-home community in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Average rents for Villas at Park La Brea and Park Towne Place are greater than 125% of their respective local market average rents, making these communities, "A" quality as defined by Aimco. Average rent at 88th St. Second Avenue is between 100%-125% of New York City average rents, making this community "B" quality as defined by Aimco. Based on these factors, and information provided by the CBRE North American Cap Rate Study for First Half 2019, NOI capitalization rates for these communities ranges from 4.40% - 4.90%.  

[2]  

The projected NOI yield on incremental investment at stabilization reflects the weighted average yield for the current population of communities under construction or lease-up.  

[3]  

These communities are located in high-quality submarkets including: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Projected stabilized average rents for these communities are greater than 125% of their respective local market average rents, making these communities, on average, "A" quality as defined by Aimco. Based on these factors, and information provided by the CBRE North American Cap Rate Study for First Half 2019, NOI weighted capitalization rates for this set of communities could range from 4.40% - 4.70%. 

Aimco estimates the fair value of occupancy stabilized communities by annualizing the most recent quarter’s Proportionate Property NOI and applying an appropriate capitalization rate. Aimco estimates the fair value for the communities under construction or in lease-up by discounting projected future cash flows through community stabilization. See Aimco’s September 30, 2019 NAV Presentation on Aimco’s website at investors.aimco.com for additional information. The fair value of these communities may also be derived by applying an appropriate capitalization rate to estimated post redevelopment Proportionate Property NOI. The post redevelopment Proportionate Property NOI may be calculated as the combination of Pre-redevelopment Proportionate Property NOI (defined on the next page) and the projected proportionate incremental stabilized property NOI as estimated based on the projected yield on current inception-to-date investment.

(Page 3 of 4) 

Terms and Definitions 

Estimated Net Investment - represents total estimated investment, net of tax and other credits earned by Aimco as a direct result of its redevelopment or development of the community. Total estimated investment includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to redevelop or develop the respective community, as determined in accordance with GAAP. 

Stabilized Occupancy - period in which Aimco expects to achieve stabilized occupancy (greater than 90%). 

NOI Stabilization - period in which Aimco expects to achieve stabilized rents and operating costs, generally five quarters after Stabilized Occupancy. 

Average Revenue per Apartment Home Redeveloped or Constructed - represents the actual revenues per apartment home, which includes rents and other rental income, prior to redevelopment, and the projected revenues per apartment home following redevelopment or construction, excluding rent and other rental income from commercial leases (which are presented separately on page 1 of this schedule) and resident utility reimbursements. Projections of stabilized revenues per apartment home are based on management’s judgment at the start of a redevelopment or development project. These projections consider factors including but not limited to: current rent; other rental income expectations; and revenue achievement to date as compared to current market rents. 

Pre-redevelopment Proportionate Property NOI - estimated by applying (a) market revenue and expense growth rates derived from third-party information for the period immediately preceding construction through the current period to (b) Proportionate Property NOI results immediately preceding construction. 

Projected Stabilized NOI Yield on Incremental Investment at Stabilization - for redevelopment projects, represents projected stabilized incremental net operating income (including commercial lease income) as a percentage of the Estimated Net Investment. Projected incremental net operating income for redevelopment projects includes the estimated stabilized rate increase that is expected to be achieved and the estimated expense savings resulting from the redevelopment. For development projects, this represents projected stabilized net operating income as a percentage of the Estimated Net Investment. 

Occupancy Stabilized Communities - includes communities classified as part of Redevelopment/Development for which construction has been completed, but for which the requirements to be reclassified into Same Store have not yet been met. 

Communities Under Construction or in Lease-up - represents communities classified as part of Redevelopment/Development and included in Supplemental Schedule 10, as well as other communities classified as Redevelopment/Development that are smaller in scope and therefore not included in Supplemental Schedule 10.

GLOSSARY AND RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASURES 

This Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial and operating measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Aimco’s definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP financial and operating measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable. These non-GAAP financial and operating measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance and should not be considered an alternative measure of liquidity. 

AIMCO OP: AIMCO Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, is the operating partnership in Aimco’s UPREIT structure. Aimco owns approximately 94.0% of the common partnership units of the Aimco OP. 

AIMCO PROPORTIONATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION: Within this Earnings Release and Supplemental Information, Aimco provides certain financial information necessary to calculate Aimco’s share of financial information. This information is not, nor is it intended to be, a presentation in accordance with GAAP. Aimco’s proportionate share of financial information includes Aimco’s share of unconsolidated real estate partnerships and excludes the noncontrolling interest partners’ share of consolidated real estate partnerships. 

Aimco does not control the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and the calculation of Aimco’s share of the assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses does not represent a legal claim to a proportionate share of such items. The amount of cash distributions partners in such partnerships may receive is based upon specific provisions in the partnership agreements and may vary based on whether such distributions are generated from operations, capital events or liquidation. 

Proportionate information benefits the users of Aimco’s financial information by providing the amount of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other items attributable to Aimco stockholders. Other companies may calculate their proportionate information differently than Aimco does, limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, the non-GAAP Aimco proportionate financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for information included in Aimco’s financial statements as reported under GAAP. 

AVERAGE AGE OF APARTMENT COMMUNITIES: Calculated by Aimco on a property-by-property basis based on the year the community was originally built, adjusted for redevelopment and/or other major capital improvements that effectively reduce the age of the community. Such investments include construction of new buildings and/or amenities, replacement or modernization of mechanical, plumbing and electrical systems and other investments that are consequential in nature. The average age of apartment communities is weighted by the estimated fair value of the properties. 

AVERAGE REVENUE PER APARTMENT HOME: Represents Aimco proportionate average monthly rental and other property revenues, excluding resident reimbursement of utility cost, divided by the number of occupied apartment homes as of the end of the period. 

34   

CAPITAL ADDITIONS DEFINITIONS 

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS (CI): CI represent capital additions made to replace the portion of acquired apartment communities consumed prior to Aimco’s period of ownership and not contemplated in Aimco’s underwriting of an acquisition. 

CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS (CR): Unlike CI, CR does not increase the useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. CR represent capital additions made to replace the portion of acquired capital assets consumed during Aimco’s period of ownership. CR is deducted in the calculation of AFFO. See below for a reconciliation between CR amounts on Schedule 2 and Schedule 9 (in thousands, unaudited). 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

CASUALTY CAPITAL ADDITIONS: Casualty capital additions represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with the restoration of an asset after a casualty event such as a severe snow storm, hurricane, tornado, flood or fire. 

CAPITAL ENHANCEMENTS (CE): CE may include kitchen and bath remodeling; energy conservation projects; and investments in longer-lived materials designed to reduce turnover costs, such as simulated wood flooring and granite countertops. CE differs from Redevelopment Additions in that they are generally lesser in scope and do not significantly disrupt property operations. 

INITIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (ICE): ICE represent capital additions contemplated in the underwriting at Aimco’s recently acquired communities. 

REDEVELOPMENT ADDITIONS: Redevelopment additions represent capital additions intended to enhance the value of the apartment community through the ability to generate higher average rental rates. Redevelopment additions may include costs related to entitlement, which enhance the value of a community through increased density, and costs related to renovation of exteriors, common areas or apartment homes. 

DEVELOPMENT ADDITIONS: Development additions represent construction and related capitalized costs associated with ground-up development projects. 

CONTRIBUTION FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT: In July 2018, Aimco sold its interest in its Asset Management business. Asset Management refers generally to the activities Aimco performed in its role as general partner in partnerships holding low-income housing tax credit apartment communities, and which were structured to provide for the pass-through of tax credits and deductions to their partners. As presented in Supplemental Schedule 2, Contribution from Asset Management consists of Pro forma FFO related to apartment communities served by Aimco’s Asset Management business; income associated with delivery of tax credits to the non-Aimco investors in the partnerships; and other income; less asset management expenses (including certain allocated offsite costs related to the operation of this business) prior to Aimco’s sale of this business. 

35   

CONTRIBUTION FROM REAL ESTATE: As presented in Supplemental Schedule 2, Contribution from Real Estate represents the Pro forma FFO generated by Aimco’s portfolio of apartment communities, which consists of property net operating income and other items of income or expense that relate to Aimco’s portfolio, including property management expenses, casualty losses, interest expense related to non-recourse property debt encumbering these communities, and interest income Aimco earns on its investment in a securitization trust that holds certain Aimco property debt. 

ECONOMIC INCOME: As discussed in Supplemental Schedule 1, Economic Income represents stockholder value creation as measured by the change in estimated net asset value, or NAV, per share, plus cash dividends per share. Aimco believes Economic Income is important to investors as it represents a measure of total return we have earned for our stockholders. NAV, as used in our calculation of Economic Income, is a non-GAAP measure and represents the estimated fair value of assets net of liabilities attributable to Aimco’s common stockholders and the Aimco Operating Partnership’s common unitholders on a diluted basis. Aimco reports and reconciles Economic Income to GAAP equity annually. Please refer to the section entitled Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations described in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for more information about Economic Income. 

FREE CASH FLOW: Free Cash Flow, as calculated for Aimco’s retained portfolio, represents an apartment community’s property net operating income, less spending for Capital Replacements. Capital Replacement spending is a measure of the cost of capital asset used during the period. Aimco believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of apartment community performance because it takes into consideration costs incurred during the period to replace capital assets that have been consumed during Aimco’s ownership. 

FREE CASH FLOW CAP RATE: Free Cash Flow Cap Rate represents the NOI Cap Rate, adjusted for assumed Capital Replacements spending of $1,200 per apartment home. 

FREE CASH FLOW MARGIN: Free Cash Flow Margin represents an apartment community’s property net operating income less $1,200 per apartment home of assumed annual Capital Replacement spending, as a percentage of the apartment community’s rental and other property revenues. 

LEVERAGE RATIO DEFINITIONS 

Aimco’s leverage strategy targets the ratio of Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDAre to be below 7.0x and the ratio of Adjusted EBITDAre to Adjusted Interest and Preferred Dividends to be greater than 2.5x. Aimco also focuses on the ratios of Proportionate Debt to Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre Coverage of Adjusted Interest. Aimco believes these ratios, which are based in part on non-GAAP financial information, are commonly used by investors and analysts to assess the relative financial risk associated with balance sheets of companies within the same industry, and they are believed to be similar to measures used by rating agencies to assess entity credit quality. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of performance. There can be no assurance that Aimco’s method of calculating EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. 

Aimco’s net leverage includes Aimco’s share of long-term, non-recourse property debt, outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility, and outstanding preferred equity, reduced by cash and restricted cash on-hand and its investment in a securitization trust that holds certain of its property debt. Aimco reconciles consolidated balances to its net leverage on Supplemental Schedule 5(a). 

36   

Aimco calculates Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Interest used in its leverage ratios based on current quarter amounts, annualized. 

EBITDAre AND ADJUSTED EBITDAre 

EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION FOR REAL ESTATE (“EBITDAre”): Nareit defines EBITDAre as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, further adjusted for: 

•   

gains and losses on the dispositions of depreciated property; 

•   

impairment write-downs of depreciated property; 

•   

impairment write-downs of investments in unconsolidated partnerships caused by a decrease in the value of the depreciated property in such partnerships; and 

•   

adjustments to reflect the Aimco’s share of EBITDAre of investments in unconsolidated entities. 

Aimco believes that EBITDAre is useful to investors, creditors and rating agencies as a supplemental measure of Aimco’s ability to incur and service debt because it is a recognized measure of performance by the real estate industry and facilitates comparison of credit strength between Aimco and other companies. 

ADJUSTED EBITDAre: Adjusted EBITDAre is defined by Aimco as EBITDAre adjusted to exclude the effect of the following items for the reasons set forth below: 

•   

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships and EBITDAre adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests, to allow investors to compare a measure of Aimco’s earnings before the effects of Aimco’s capital structure and indebtedness with that of other companies in the real estate industry; 

•   

the amount of interest income recognized by Aimco related to its investment in the subordinated tranches in a securitization trust holding primarily Aimco property debt, as Aimco views its interest cost on this debt to be net of any interest income received; and 

•   

the amount by which GAAP rent expense exceeds cash rents for a long-term ground lease for which expense exceeds cash payments until 2076. The excess of the GAAP rent expense over the cash payments for this lease does not reflect a current obligation that affects Aimco’s ability to service debt; 

37   

A reconciliation of net income to EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre for Aimco’s portfolio for the three months ended December 31, 2019 is as follows (in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

[1]  

In 2019, Aimco incurred severance and restructuring costs in connection with the closure and relocation of office functions from its Greenville and Indianapolis offices to Denver. Aimco excluded such costs from Adjusted EBITDAre because it believes these costs are not representative of operating performance. 

[2]  

Aimco incurred casualty losses due to storm-related flooding in downtown Boston that caused damage to its One Canal apartment community. Aimco excluded such costs from Adjusted EBITDAre because of the unusual nature of the weather event that caused the loss. 

[3]  

Adjusted EBITDAre has been calculated on a pro forma basis to reflect the dispositions of four apartment communities during the period and the Parkmerced mezzanine loan investment, including related transaction costs, as if the transactions had closed on October 1, 2019. 

In 2019, Aimco retitled its Adjusted EBITDA measure to Adjusted EBITDAre in its calculation of leverage ratios. The computation of Adjusted EBITDAre has been modified from Aimco’s prior measure to include the amortization of debt issuance costs as a component of interest expense in both the computation of Adjusted Interest Expense and Adjusted EBITDAre. The impact of this change is less than 0.1x to each ratio. Aimco also added a reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDAre in the table above. EBITDAre is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, and provides for an additional performance measure independent of capital structure for greater comparability between REITs. 

ADJUSTED INTEREST EXPENSE: Adjusted Interest Expense represents Aimco’s proportionate share of interest expense on non-recourse property debt and interest on the credit facility borrowings less (i) prepayment penalties, if any, and (ii) the amount of interest income recognized by Aimco related to its investment in the subordinated tranches in a securitization trust holding primarily Aimco property debt. 

Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as used in the leverage ratios on Supplemental Schedule 5(a), are calculated as follows (in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

38   

FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO: As defined by Aimco’s credit agreement, the ratio of (a) EBITDA to (b) fixed charges, which represent the sum of (i) Aimco’s proportionate share of interest expense (excluding prepayment penalties and amortization of debt issuance costs), (ii) debt amortization and (iii) Preferred Dividends, for the four fiscal quarters preceding the date of calculation. The calculation of certain of these measures as defined by Aimco’s Credit Agreement may differ from those used by Aimco in the calculations of its Leverage Ratios. 

PREFERRED DIVIDENDS: Preferred dividends include dividends paid with respect to Aimco’s Preferred Stock and the Aimco OP’s Preferred Partnership Units, exclusive of preferred equity redemption related amounts. 

PREFERRED EQUITY: Preferred equity represents the redemption amounts for Aimco’s Preferred Stock and the Aimco OP’s Preferred Partnership Units and may be found in Aimco’s consolidated balance sheets and on Supplemental Schedule 5(b). 

PROPORTIONATE DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDAre RATIO: The ratio of (a) Aimco’s share of net leverage as calculated on Supplemental Schedule 5(a) and shown above, excluding Preferred Equity to (b) Adjusted EBITDAre. 

PROPORTIONATE DEBT AND PREFERRED EQUITY TO ADJUSTED EBITDAre RATIO: The ratio of (a) Aimco’s share of net leverage attributable to its Real Estate portfolio as calculated on Supplemental Schedule 5(a) and shown above to (b) Adjusted EBITDAre. 

NAREIT FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (Nareit FFO): Nareit FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit) defines as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding: depreciation and amortization related to real estate; gains and losses from sales or impairment of depreciable assets and land used in the primary business of the REIT; and income taxes directly associated with a gain or loss on sale of real estate; and including Aimco’s share of Nareit FFO of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Aimco computes Nareit FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by Nareit. 

In addition to Nareit FFO, Aimco uses PRO FORMA FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (Pro forma FFO) and ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO) to measure short-term performance. Pro forma FFO represents Nareit FFO as defined above, excluding certain amounts that are unique or occur infrequently. Aimco’s pro forma adjustments are defined in further detail in the footnotes to Supplemental Schedule 1. 

AFFO represents Pro forma FFO reduced by Capital Replacements and is Aimco’s primary measure of current period performance. 

Nareit FFO, Pro forma FFO and AFFO are non-GAAP measures that Aimco believes are helpful to investors in understanding Aimco’s short-term performance because they capture features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than other capital assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. Nareit FFO, Pro forma FFO and AFFO should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP, as indicators of performance. There can be no assurance that Aimco’s method of computing Nareit FFO, Pro forma FFO or AFFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. 

39   

The following table reconciles GAAP net income per share to Pro forma FFO per share and AFFO per share, each as presented at the mid-point of Aimco’s guidance range:

Adjustment to Pro forma FFO for the straight-line rent expense adjustment required by GAAP for a long-dated ground lease. See further description above. 

NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI) CAP RATE: NOI Cap Rate is calculated based on Aimco’s share of the proportionate property NOI for the trailing twelve months prior to sale, less a 3% management fee, divided by Aimco gross proceeds. 

NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI) MARGIN: Represents an apartment community’s net operating income as a percentage of the apartment community’s rental and other property revenues. 

OTHER EXPENSES, NET: Other expenses, net allocated to real estate property operating expenses on Supplemental Schedule 2 includes franchise taxes, and expenses specifically related to Aimco’s administration of its real estate partnerships, for example, services such as audit, tax and legal. Other expenses, net not allocated to real estate property operating expenses generally consists of risk management activities related to Aimco’s unconsolidated partnerships and certain other corporate expenses. 

PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI) and PROPORTIONATE PROPERTY NOI: NOI is defined by Aimco as total property rental and other property revenues less direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes. NOI does not include: property management revenues, primarily from affiliates; casualties; property management expenses; depreciation; or interest expense. NOI is helpful because it helps both investors and management to understand the operating performance of real estate excluding costs associated with decisions about acquisition pricing, overhead allocations and financing arrangements. NOI is also considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of real estate. Reconciliations of NOI as presented in this Earnings Release and Supplemental Information to Aimco’s consolidated GAAP amounts are provided below. 

Due to the diversity of its economic ownership interests in its apartment communities in the periods presented, Aimco evaluates the performance of the apartment communities in its segments using Proportionate Property NOI, which represents Aimco’s share of the NOI for the apartment communities that Aimco consolidates and manages but excludes apartment communities that it does not consolidate. Proportionate Property NOI is defined as Aimco share of rental and other property revenue less Aimco share of property operating expenses. In its evaluation of community results, Aimco excludes from rental and other property revenues the amount of utility costs reimbursed by residents and reflects such amount as a reduction of the related utility expense within property operating expenses. The following table presents the reconciliation of GAAP rental and other property revenue to the proportionate revenues before utility reimbursements and GAAP property operating expenses to proportionate expenses, net of utility reimbursements. The table also presents the reconciliation of consolidated Same Store revenue before utility reimbursements and expenses, net of utility reimbursements as presented on Supplemental Schedule 2(a) to the proportionate amounts presented on Supplemental Schedule 6.

Nearly two-thirds of Aimco’s utility costs are reimbursed by residents. These reimbursements are included in rental and other property revenues on Aimco’s consolidated statements of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. This adjustment represents the reclassification of utility reimbursements from revenues to property operating expenses for the purpose of evaluating segment results and as presented on Supplemental Schedule 2, Supplemental Schedule 3, and Supplemental Schedule 6. Aimco also excludes the reimbursement amounts from the calculation of Average Revenue per Apartment Home throughout this Earnings Release and Supplemental Schedules.

Sold properties and other amounts not allocated to Real Estate includes operating results of apartment communities sold during the periods shown or held for sale at the end of the period, as well as property management and casualty expense, which are not included in property operating expenses, net of utility reimbursements in the Supplemental Schedule 2 presentation.

Proportionate adjustments represent the noncontrolling interests’ share of the rental and other property revenues before utility reimbursements and property operating expenses, net of utility reimbursements. Such adjustment is necessary to reconcile consolidated amounts presented on Supplemental Schedule 2 to the amounts allocated to Aimco’s operating segments, as well as to reconcile Same Store amounts presented on Supplemental Schedule 2 to proportionate same store amounts presented on Supplemental Schedules 6.

PORTFOLIO QUALITY RATINGS: Aimco measures the quality of apartment communities in its portfolio based on average rents of its apartment homes compared to local market average rents as reported by a third-party provider of commercial real estate performance and analysis. Under this rating system, Aimco classifies as “A” quality apartment communities those earning rents greater than 125% of local market average; as “B” quality apartment communities those earning rents between 90% and 125% of local market average; “C+” quality apartment communities those earning rents greater than $1,100 per month, but lower than 90% of local market average; and “C” quality apartment communities those earning rents less than $1,100 per month and lower than 90% of local market average. 

REAL ESTATE CLASSIFICATIONS: Aimco’s portfolio of apartment communities is diversified by both price point and geography. Aimco’s portfolio is classified into four segments, as follows: 

SAME STORE: Same Store apartment communities are apartment communities that (a) are owned and managed by Aimco, (b) had reached a stabilized level of operations as of January 1, 2018 and maintained it throughout the current and the comparable prior periods and (c) are not expected to be sold within 12 months. 

ACQUISITION: Includes apartment communities acquired since January 1, 2018. The communities are Bent Tree Apartments, the portfolio of five properties in Philadelphia acquired in 2018 and 2019, Avery Row, and Prism (50 Rogers). 

REDEVELOPMENT/DEVELOPMENT: Includes apartment communities currently under construction that have not achieved a stabilized level of operations and those that have been completed in recent years that had not achieved and maintained stabilized operations for both the current and the comparable prior periods. 

OTHER REAL ESTATE: Includes apartment communities subject to limitations on rent increases, communities that Aimco expects to sell within 12 months that do not meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale, certain retail spaces and 1001 Brickell Bay Drive. 

SOLD AND HELD FOR SALE APARTMENT COMMUNITIES: Apartment communities either sold since January 1, 2018 or classified as held for sale at the end of the period. For purposes of highlighting results of operations related to Aimco’s retained portfolio, results for Sold and Held For Sale Apartment Communities are excluded from property net operating income and presented separately on a net basis on Supplemental Schedule 2. Information about property net operating income for Sold and Held For Sale Apartment Communities may be found on Supplemental Schedule 3. 

TURNOVER: Represents the percentage of residents who have moved out in the trailing twelve months. Turnover is calculated by dividing the number of move outs in the trailing twelve months, exclusive of intra-community transfers, by the daily average number of occupied apartment homes during the trailing twelve months. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, Turnover was 43.2%, 150 basis points lower than the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Inclusive of intra-community transfers, Turnover was 47.3% for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2019.
