DAVID GIBBS & CHRIS TURNER COMMENTS

David Gibbs, CEO, said “I am proud to announce that we completed our three-year transformation of Yum!, having achieved all of our transformation goals and evolved into a more focused, more franchised and more efficient business. 2019 was a truly historic year for our company. For the full-year, we generated over $50 billion in system sales and ended the year with over 50,000 restaurants thanks to our world-class franchisees. We delivered results consistent with our long-term growth algorithm with same-store sales growth of 3% and net-new unit growth of 4%. We began 2020 by announcing an agreement to add the Habit Burger Grill to the Yum! family. When complete, this deal should enable us to offer an exciting new investment opportunity to our existing franchisees and expand an award-winning, trend-forward brand through the power of Yum!’s unmatched scale. As we move into the next phase of growth for Yum!, we will continue to focus on our four key growth drivers with a collaborative mindset to fuel strong results for years to come.”

Chris Turner, CFO, continued “Fourth-quarter results were a solid end to the year where we met or exceeded each component of our guidance, including full-year 2019 core operating profit growth, which was an increase of 12%, or 11% excluding the 53rd week. I'm especially pleased that we opened over 1,000 net new units in the fourth-quarter alone. We’ve emerged from our transformation a stronger company, and I look forward to accelerating the growth of our iconic brands, championing the customer experience and unlocking further value for our stakeholders.”

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results

(amounts in millions, except per share amounts)

(unaudited)

In addition to the results provided in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), the Company provides the following non-GAAP measurements.

•System sales, System sales excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation ("FX") and, in 2019, System sales excluding FX and the impact of 53rd week for our U.S. subsidiaries and certain international subsidiaries that operate on a weekly periodic calendar. System sales include the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company-owned and franchise restaurants. Sales at franchise restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise and license fees for the Company at a rate of 3% to 6% of sales. Franchise restaurant sales are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise and license fees are included in the Company’s revenues. We believe System sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our significant drivers, Company and franchise same-store sales as well as net unit growth.

•Diluted Earnings Per Share ("EPS") excluding Special Items (as defined below);

•Effective Tax Rate excluding Special Items;

•Core Operating Profit and, in 2019, Core Operating Profit excluding the impact of the 53rd week. Core Operating Profit excludes Special Items and FX and we use Core Operating Profit for the purposes of evaluating performance internally.

These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measurements provide additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.

Special Items are not included in any of our Division segment results as the Company does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature. Our chief operating decision maker does not consider the impact of Special Items when assessing segment performance. The Special Items are described in (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) in the accompanying notes.

Certain non-GAAP measurements are presented excluding the impact of FX. These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the FX impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.

For 2019 we provided Core Operating Profit excluding the impact of the 53rd week and System sales excluding the impact of the 53rd week to further enhance the comparability given the 53rd week that was part of our fiscal calendar in 2019.

Reconciliation of GAAP Diluted EPS to 2019 Adjusted EPS

In connection with the announcement of our strategic transformation initiatives in 2016, we announced a non-GAAP 2019 Diluted EPS target of at least $3.75 (“2019 Adjusted EPS Target”). This 2019 Adjusted EPS Target was intended to exclude:

•Any impact from changes in FX rates (i.e. FX rates were assumed not to change from those in place when we determined the 2019 Adjusted EPS Target in 2016)

•Any Special Items in 2019; and

•The impact of the 53rd week in 2019 for our U.S. businesses and certain international subsidiaries that report on a period calendar;

Additionally, we acquired an interest in Grubhub common stock subsequent to our original determination of the 2019 Adjusted EPS Target and thus have excluded the resulting 2019 mark-to-market adjustment for that investment when determining actual results versus the 2019 Adjusted EPS Target. Provided below is a reconciliation of our GAAP Diluted EPS to 2019 Adjusted EPS adjusting for the factors as discussed above.

Notes to the Consolidated Summary of Results, Consolidated Balance Sheets

and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

(amounts in millions)

(unaudited)

(a)Amounts presented as of and for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2019 are preliminary.

(b)We have reflected as Special Items those refranchising gains and losses that were recorded in connection with our previously announced plans to have at least 98% franchise restaurant ownership by the end of 2018. As such, refranchising gains and losses recorded during 2019 as Special Items primarily include gains or losses associated with sales of underlying real estate associated with stores that were franchised as of December 31, 2018 or true-ups to refranchising gains and losses recorded prior to December 31, 2018.

During the quarters ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded net refranchising losses of $6 million and net refranchising gains of $255 million, respectively, that have been reflected as Special Items. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded net refranchising gains of $12 million and $540 million, respectively, that have been reflected as Special Items.

Additionally, during both the quarter and year ended December 31, 2019 we recorded net refranchising gains of $25 million that have not been reflected as Special Items. These net gains relate to the refranchising of restaurants in 2019 that were not part of our aforementioned plans to achieve 98% franchise ownership.

(c)In May 2017, we reached an agreement with our Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees that will improve brand marketing alignment, accelerate enhancements in operations and technology and that included a permanent commitment to incremental advertising as well as digital and technology contributions by franchisees. In connection with this agreement, we recognized Special Item charges of $8 million and $3 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we recognized Special Item charges of $13 million and $6 million, respectively. The majority of these costs were recorded within Franchise and property expenses. 

(d)During the second quarter of 2019, we recorded charges of $8 million and $2 million to Other (income) expense and Interest expense, net, respectively, related to cash payments in excess of our recorded liability to settle contingent consideration associated with our acquisition of the KFC Turkey and Pizza Hut Turkey businesses in 2013. Consistent with prior adjustments to the recorded contingent consideration we have reflected this as a Special Item.

(e)Tax Benefit (Expense) on Special Items was determined based upon the impact of the nature, as well as the jurisdiction of the respective individual components within Special Items. Additionally, we increased our Income tax provision by $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 to record a reserve against and by $19 million in the second quarter of 2018 to correct an error related to the tax recorded on a prior year divestiture, the effects of which were previously recorded as a Special Item.

(f)During the quarter ended December 31, 2019 we completed intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights. As a result of the transfer of certain of these rights, largely to subsidiaries in the United Kingdom (UK), we received a step-up in tax basis to current fair value under applicable tax law. To the extent this step-up in basis will be amortizable against future taxable income, we recognized a one-time deferred tax benefit of $226 million as a Special Item in the quarter ended December 31, 2019. 

(g)During the quarter and year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $3 million and $35 million decreases, respectively, related to our provisional tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Act") that was reported as a Special Item. 

We also recorded Special Items tax benefits of $1 million and $31 million, respectively, in the quarter and year ended December 31, 2018 related to 2018 U.S. foreign tax credits that became realizable directly as a result of the impact of deemed repatriation tax expense with the Tax Act.

18

(h)Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard. As a result, we are now required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities upon lease commencement for operating leases based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Under our historical accounting, operating leases were not recognized on the balance sheet. Prior results have not been restated for the impact of this accounting change. Upon adoption we recognized right-of-use assets for leases in place at January 1, 2019 of $690 million, which are presented within Other Assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Also upon adoption we recognized lease liabilities of $83 million and $661 million within Accounts payable and other current liabilities and Other liabilities and deferred credits, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The impact of the new operating lease accounting on our results of operations and cash flows was not significant.
